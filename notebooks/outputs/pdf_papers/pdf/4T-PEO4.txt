Conjugated Liquid Crystal and Its Implication for Ionic 
Conductivity Characteristics

In this work, a joint experimental and computational study on the synthesis, 
self-assembly, and ionic conduction characteristics of a new conjugated liquid 
crystal quaterthiophene/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO4) consisting of terminal 
tetraethyleneglycol monomethyl ether groups on both ends of a quaterthio-
phene core is performed. In agreement with molecular dynamic simulations, 
temperature-dependent grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering and 
X-ray diffraction indicate that the molecule spontaneously forms a smectic 
phase at ambient temperature as characterized both in bulk and thin film 
configurations. Significantly, this smectic phase is maintained upon blending 
with bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)imide as ion source at a concentration 
ratio up to r = [Li+]/[EO] = 0.05. Nanosegregation between oligothiophene 
and PEO moieties and π–π stacking of thiophene rings lead to the formation 
of efficient 2D pathways for ion transport, resulting in thin-film in-plane ionic 
conductivity as high as 5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 70 °C and r = 0.05 as measured 
by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Upon heating the samples above 
a transition temperature around 95 °C, an isotropic phase forms associated 
with a pronounced drop in ionic conductivity. Upon cooling, partial and local 
reordering of the conducting smectic domains leads to an ionic conductivity 
decrease compared to the as-cast state.

the crystalline phase, but they are easier to 
align homogeneously and spontaneously 
over large areas.[3] Ordered self-assembled 
molecules can induce enhanced proper-
ties and functions,[4] thus enabling specific 
applications in a wide variety of advanced 
technologies.[5,6] The idea of using LCs 
for ion[7–10] and electron[5,6,11,12] transport 
has attracted much attention in recent 
decades. The spontaneous phase segre-
gation between immiscible parts[5,6,13–15] 
enables the use of LCs as anisotropic 
ion conductors, making them promising 
candidates for energy devices. Moreover, 
their properties of fast assembly and easy 
processability[16] excel those of traditional 
electrolytes. By tuning the molecular 
shape and intermolecular interactions, 
mesogenic molecules can self-assemble 
into a range of LC nanostructures such as 
columnar, smectic, or bicontinuous cubic 
phases, providing 1D,[17–19] 2D,[20–24] and 
3D[7,25–28] ion transport pathways. These 
molecules have been proposed for poten-
tial application as efficient and stable elec-
trolytes for batteries and dye-sensitized 
solar cells.[10,29–33] 1D and 2D channels formed by discotic and 
rod-like LCs, respectively, are mostly studied.
In general, ion-conducting LCs consist of polar or ionic 
groups such as cyclic carbonates,[10,32–34] poly(ethylene oxide)
s (PEOs),[20,21,35,36] or cationic and anionic moieties attached 
to rod-like or wedge-shaped moieties to achieve columnar

Liquid crystals (LCs) are thermodynamically stable phases

and smectic structures.[37] The 2D arrangement of smectics 
is believed to be more tolerant with regard to defects than 1D 
ordered columns and provides more directions for ion transport 
therefore results in an improved performance.[3] Despite large 
amount of recent work focusing on ionic conduction achieved 
by small ionic or cyclic carbonate moieties, PEO remains a pop-
ular component for ion-transport LCs. Extensive studies have 
shown that PEO possesses excellent solvating capability for 
a wide range of lithium salts, and inherently high ionic con-
ductivity and facile processability.[38] In these molecules, PEO 
moieties are usually attached to mesogenic fragments so that 
the coexistence of ion-conducting and nonconducting phases 
induces better phase segregation and ions are transported 
through segmental motion of PEO fragments.
Phase segregation and self-assembly provide additional func-
tionality and stability to LC materials. Generally, segregation is 
favored in molecules with well-defined intramolecular contrast, 
such as distinct rigid and flexible segments. Apart from specific 
intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and ionic 
interactions that play key roles in the formation of complex struc-
tures, π–π stacking interaction is also considered one of the very 
important noncovalent interactions as driving force for molecules 
to achieve hierarchical self-assembly.[39,40] Abundant evidence 
from the columnar stacking of discotic LC mole­cules suggests 
that self-assembly through strong π–π stacking could be an effec-
tive approach to 1D nanostructures for planar, rigid organic mole­
cules,[6,41] and it could also be effective to obtain 2D nanostruc-
tures with calamitic molecules. π–π stacking has in fact been 
observed in many oligothiophenes and their derivatives.[42–48] 
Experimental measurements indicate that π–π interaction plays 
an important role in the control of the solid-state and self-assem-
bled structures of thiophene oligomers and polymers.[49,50]
To this end, we report the synthesis and characterization of a 
coil-rod-coil π-conjugated LC compound (quaterthiophene (4T)/
PEO4) consisting of oligothiophene and ethylene oxide moie-
ties. The rigid rod mesogen consists of four thiophene rings 
whereas the flexible tetra(ethylene oxide) segments on both ends 
of the mesogen core function as ion transport domains. Oli-
gothiophene moieties, commonly used in flexible electronics, 
were chosen to endow electron transport properties to the com-
pound for a promising mixed ionic/electronic conducting mate-
rial. Using both grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering 
(GIWAXS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we show 
that the compound exhibits ordered smectic phases in the 
absence and presence of lithium bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)
imide (LiTFSI) at concentration r = [Li+]/[EO] up to 0.05. Tem-
perature-dependent GIWAXS and MD simulations indicated 
that π–π interaction among mesogens also plays a key role 
in controlling LC self-assembly. Further, ionic conductivity is 
measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for 
different doping ratios ranging from 25 to 130 °C. Our results 
provide important new insights into self-assembly behavior of 
this class of π-conjugated LCs and their morphology–ion trans-
port relationship.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Synthesis of Liquid Crystalline Material 4T/PEO4
A quaterthiophene-based π-conjugated LC compound desig-
nated 4T/PEO4, has been designed and synthesized as shown 
in Scheme  1. In this molecule, the terminal PEO4 segments 
are directly attached to both ends of a 4T core without any 
linker, in order to maximize the volume ratio and ion trans-
port function of PEO moieties. The synthesis of compound 4T/
PEO4 was accomplished via twofold Kumada cross-coupling 
of 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene with three equivalents of the 
corresponding brominated thiophene-PEO4 precursors in the 
presence of Ni(dppp)Cl2 as catalyst. The compound is a viscous 
dark red solid at room temperature and was characterized by 
1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 
(see the Supporting Information).
2.2. Thermal and Structural Properties of Bulk  
4T/PEO4-LiTFSI Complexes
The thermal properties of the compound 4T/PEO4 were ana-
lyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Optical tex-
tures of the substances exhibiting LC phases were obtained 
by polarized optical microscopy (POM). Here, we investi-
gate the structure of 4T/PEO4 blended with LiTFSI which 
has good thermal stability, high ion dissociation rate, and 
high ionic conductivity.[51] Specifically, we choose to study 
4T/PEO4-LiTFSI complexes with three different blending

ratios r = [Li+]/[EO] = 0 (neat sample), 0.01, and 0.05. We notice 
that higher blending concentration r results in a more complex 
structure due to the strong interaction of LiTFSI with the LC 
molecules and is the subject of a separate investigation.
Figure 1a presents the DSC traces from the first cooling scans 
and the subsequent second heating scans obtained for the three 
samples r = 0, 0.01, and 0.05. The doping ratio r was set between 
0 and 0.05 because ionic conductivity in polyether derivatives 
generally shows a maximum in the vicinity of 0.05  mol of 
ions to ethylene oxide unit.[20] The thermogravimetric analysis 
(TGA) results shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information) 
suggest that both 4T/PEO4 and LiTFSI remain stable within 
the DSC temperature range. All three samples exhibit stable LC 
mesophases at room temperature. Pristine compound 4T/PEO4 
(r = 0) shows a pronounced transition during both cooling and 
heating processes. The blended complexes, on the other hand, 
exhibit more complicated thermal behaviors, including mul-
tiple phases observed from the small shoulder peak around the 
transition temperature as well as a monotropic transition in the 
heating process for r  = 0.05. A sharp transition temperature 
appears around 94 °C for all three samples (93.8 °C for r = 0, 
94.3 °C for r = 0.01, and 94.2 °C for r = 0.05) suggesting that 
the addition of LiTFSI does not change the structure and phase 
of 4T/PEO4. What cannot be neglected, however, is the broad-
ening of the transition peak and the appearance of a shoulder 
peak (86.8 °C) for sample r = 0.05, which suggests that an even 
more complicated phase shows up and overwhelms the original 
smectic phase. A higher doping ratio was not adopted due to 
the possibility that the incorporation of large TFSI anions is 
antagonistic to an ordered phase and may disturb the in-plane 
packing of thiophenes in the smectic layer and therefore desta-
bilize the LC structures.[10]
The POM images provide a clearer picture toward the 
process of the phase transition. The bulk material is placed 
between a piece of glass microscope slide and cover slip. The 
sample is heated to above the transition temperature at a 
heating rate of 10  °C min−1, the same as the DSC scan rate. 
A film of several micrometers thick is formed between the 
microscope slide and cover slip when the sample optically turns 
black under the polarized light microscope, signifying an iso-
tropic melt. In Figure 1b, the formation of a batonnet texture, 
typical for a smectic phase, is observed for pristine 4T/PEO4 
compound when cooled from isotropic melt at 95 °C. Such a 
texture is maintained until the sample is cooled down to 60 °C 
(see Figure 1c) where the texture becomes more uniform, sug-
gesting that the compound has formed a smectic phase. The 
two blended complexes, on the other hand, exhibit more com-
plicated phase transitions during the cooling process. The com-
plex with r = 0.01 also shows a batonnet texture at the begin-
ning of the cooling process, which is then taken over by two 
coexisting mesophases as shown in Figure 1d. The coexistence 
of different textures suggests the possibility of multiple meso-
phases whose transition temperatures are so close that the 
transition peaks have overlapped, consistent with DSC meas-
urement. As temperature further decreases, the batonnet tex-
ture fades while the other more ordered phase becomes the 
majority at ambient temperature (see Figure 1e). The complex 
with r = 0.05 shows a similar trend to the one with r = 0.01. An 
obvious batonnet texture at the isotropic–smectic transition was 
observed as shown in Figure  1f, which then also experiences

coexistence with and replacement by a higher ordered phase 
as temperature decreases (see Figure  1g). At room tempera-
ture the complex exhibits a less ordered smectic phase com-
pared to that with r = 0.01. Such phenomena can be attributed 
to the higher doping ratio of LiTFSI that slightly disturbs π–π 
stacking of oligothiophene thus reducing the degree of chain 
alignment within the materials.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out to examine the 
mesomorphic phase structures of compound 4T/PEO4 and its 
blended complexes with LiTFSI. Figure 2 shows the representa-
tive XRD pattern for compound 4T/PEO4 as a bulk material at 
ambient temperature. The four diffraction peaks indexed as 
(001), (002), (003), and (004) indicate a layer spacing of ≈3.5 nm 
in the smectic phase. The broad peaks in the wide-angle region 
reflect the molecular arrangement inside each layer with inter-
molecular distances from 0.33 to 0.46 nm. We assigned these 
peaks to the π–π stacking of 4T units as they are within the 
expected range of π–π stacking distance.[52,53] This result not 
only supports the existence of an ordered smectic structure 
with fixed layer distance, but also suggests π stacking between 
oligothiophene segments might play a role in maintaining such 
structure, in accordance with the POM images. Later we will 
show that this conclusion is further supported by MD simula-
tion and GIWAXS measurement. The small-angle X-ray scat-
tering patterns of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI complexes can be found in 
Figure S1 (see Supporting Information).
2.3. Self-Assembly Behavior of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI Thin Film 
Measured by Temperature-Dependent GIWAXS
To gain more insight into the self-assembly behaviors of 
4T/PEO4, we performed temperature-dependent GIWAXS 
measurement on ≈80 nm thin film samples of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI 
complexes. The experiments were carried out at different tem-
peratures ranging from 25 to 123 °C to capture the phase tran-
sition behavior of 4T/PEO4 revealed by DSC. The samples were 
equilibrated at each temperature for ≈20 min. Figure 3 shows 
exemplary GIWAXS patterns of the three samples (r = 0, 0.01, 
0.05) at selected temperatures: as-cast sample at 25  °C, high 
temperature at 123  °C, and annealed sample at 25  °C after 
cooling back from the first heating cycle. At each selected tem-
perature, the GIWAXS patterns of the three samples appear 
qualitatively similar. As shown in Figure  3a, for pristine 
4T/PEO4 thin film r = 0 at 25 °C, we observe narrow and well-
defined diffraction peaks (00h) in the out-of-plane direction up 
to the fourth order. This is evidence of a smectic morphology 
in which the layers are oriented parallel to the substrate with 
a layer distance of ≈3.42  nm, in good agreement with XRD 
results shown in Figure 2. This observation demonstrates that 
different fabrication methods do not affect LC structures and 
molecular alignment for this material. While this smectic mor-
phology is retained in both LiTFSI-blended samples at 25 °C, 
we observe an increase in the layer spacing distance from 3.42 
to 3.48 nm upon introduction of LiTFSI at r = 0.05. This obser-
vation provides indirect evidence that addition of LiTFSI swells 
the PEO domains, similar to previous studies on block copoly­
mer-salt and LC-salt complexes.[54,55] Interestingly, together 
with the smectic ordering peaks, we also observe two strong 
elongated peaks near qr ≈ 1.3–1.5 Å−1 denoted as A and B and 
other elongated peaks at higher q in Figure 3a,d,g. The A and 
B peaks originate from the π-stacking interaction of the adja-
cent 4T units whereas the other elongated peaks are the higher 
order peaks of A and B. Later we will show that this conclusion 
is further supported by molecular dynamics simulations. The 
elongation of these peaks most likely originates from the strong 
in-plane but rather weak out-of-plane interaction of the π–π 
stacking units. In other words, the 4T units interact exclusively 
with other 4T units within the same 2D smectic layer.
As the sample is heated above the transition temperature, 
the π–π diffraction peaks become notably weak in r = 0 sample 
shown in Figure 3b, and not observable in r = 0.01 and r = 0.05 
samples (see Figure 3e,h). Coinciding with the weakening/dis-
appearing of the π–π interaction peaks, we observe a substantial 
broadening of the (00h) diffraction peaks, indicating a signifi-
cant loss of smectic ordering above the transition temperature. 
Our results thus unambiguously indicate that the π–π interac-
tion of the 4T units plays a significant role in controlling the 
layered structures of 4T/PEO4. Here, it is important to note that 
at high temperature, all samples are not completely disordered 
and still maintain weakly layered structures. Upon cooling 
from above the transition temperature, partial recovery of the 
ordered smectic phases as well as some new diffraction features 
are observed as shown in Figure 3c,f,i. Any unmelt molecules 
remaining after the heating process act as nucleation sites upon 
cooling and lead to LC phases with different configurations. In 
particular, we observe a broadening along the azimuthal direc-
tion of both π–π stacking peaks and (00h) peaks (indicated by 
the arrows), which is similar to previous reports of oligothio-
phene/low molecular weight polythiophene thin films.[56,57] 
The broadening of the azimuthal breadth of the (00h) and π–π 
stacking peaks for all samples indicates disordering of the 4T 
units, which induces misalignment of the smectic domains. 
This observation provides further evidence that π–π interaction 
dictates the molecular ordering of 4T/PEO4.
To show the temperature dependence of the structure in a 
more quantitative manner, we show in Figure  4 the vertical

linecuts from the GIWAXS patterns of the three samples at all 
temperatures during the heating and cooling processes. The 
linecuts of all three complexes below the transition temperature 
during both the heating and cooling processes consist of sharp 
diffraction peaks at q/q* = 2, 3, and 4 representing (002), (003), 
and (004), again confirming a well-ordered smectic morphology 
at room temperature. As temperature increases, all the samples 
undergo an order–disorder transition, indicated by the broad-
ening of the scattering peaks in the vicinity of 100 °C, where 
a smectic–isotropic transition takes place shown by optical 
microscope. It is worth mentioning that there is a subtle dif-
ference among the transition temperatures for each sample, 
with 106–114 °C for pristine 4T/PEO4, 96–106 °C for r = 0.01 
sample, and 87–96 °C for r = 0.05 sample. The decrease in tran-
sition temperature with increasing blend ratio is in good agree-
ment with DSC measurements.
As mentioned above, the π–π stacking interaction between 
4T units has made the LC phases of 4T/PEO4 much more 
complicated than the commonly observed smectic A (SmA) or 
smectic C (SmC) phases. Highly ordered smectic phases such 
as SmF, SmG, SmI, SmJ, etc., with a long molecular axis are 
not only tilted with respect to layer surface, but also toward one 
side or one apex have been identified after SmC phases.[58] With 
GIWAXS patterns closely resembling the intermediate tilted 
phase of a fatty acid monolayer,[59] we conclude that the smectic 
phase the 4T/PEO4 exhibits belongs to is a highly ordered 
smectic phase.
2.4. Self-Assembly Behavior of 4T/PEO4 Studied by Molecular 
Dynamics Simulation
To provide complementary insights to the experimental 
results, we employ all-atom (AA) MD simulations to study the 
self-assembly behavior of 4T/PEO4 as a function of tempera-
ture. Specifically, we adopted the AA MD force field potential 
developed by Marcon and Raos (MR) as it is known to capture 
experimental density, crystal structure, and heat of sublimation 
of oligothiophenes.[60,61] However, the MR force field does not 
describe the PEO potentials, which are required to simulate 
4T/PEO4. Since the nonbonded interactions in MR model are 
obtained from optimized potentials for liquid simulations-all

atom force field (OPLS-AA),[62,63] we use it to define the missing 
potential parameters. The charges on the terminal carbon 
attached to 4T on PEO4 unit were modified to maintain charge 
neutrality. The bonded parameters were refined by fitting them 
to results from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calcu-
lations. The details of fitting and the parameters used in the 
atomistic simulation are given in the Supporting Information. 
We use LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation package[64] 
with general-purpose graphical processing units (GPGPU) 
enabled to accelerate van der Waals and particle-particle par-
ticle-mesh (PPPM) calculations.[64,65] Unless otherwise stated, 
all simulations were carried out in a triclinic periodic box at 
constant temperature and standard pressure (NPT ensemble), 
using a Nosé Hoover thermostat and barostat. The timestep for 
all simulations was 1 fs.
Our attempts to directly self-assemble this system from 
the melt state via AA simulations proved ineffective due to 
the considerable computational challenges associated with the 
slow kinetics of this process. To circumvent this limitation, 
we used a suitably calibrated coarse-grained (CG) model, an 
approach that has been proven effective in describing the self-
assembly of similar systems.[66,67] For 4T/PEO4, our CG model 
represents each thiophene ring by a single spherical bead,[68] 
and multiple aliphatic segments by a single bead depending 
on the specific chemistry (see Figure  5a).[69] We parameter-
ized bonded potentials to match the bond and angle distribu-
tion from AA simulations of 4T/PEO4 using a relative entropy 
framework.[70] Further details of the mapping procedure 
and fitted parameters of the CG model are provided in the 
Supporting Information.
The CG simulation started from an amorphous 400-mole­
cule system, shown in Figure  5a, which was equilibrated for 
5 ns at 625 °C, a high enough temperature to ensure complete 
isotropization. The amorphous system was then cooled at a con-
stant rate of 50  °C ns−1 to 27  °C, and then equilibrated at the 
final temperature for 10 ns. In agreement with XRD results of 
the bulk material and GIWAXS results of thin films, the final 
equilibrated structure obtained is smectic, where 4T units are 
tilted at an angle 25 ± 3° to the layer stacking direction. The self-
assembled CG structure at 27 °C provides a good initial guess 
for generating the LC AA structure. We used a reverse coarse-
grained technique to replace the CG beads with their atomistic 
representation as implemented by Marrink and co-workers.[71] 
The resulting AA system was relaxed at 27 °C for 10 ns. Note that 
the equilibrated AA structure (Figure  5a) provides information 
on the thiophene ring packing not available in the CG model.
Figure 5b shows a representative arrangement of six adjacent 
4T units within a smectic layer at 27 °C. We observe that the 4T 
units self-assemble into a typical herringbone packing compa-
rable to the P21/c crystal structure of pure 4T reported by Cam-
pione et  al.,[72] indicating that the 4T self-assembly drives the 
ordering of the smectic structure of 4T/PEO4. Unlike the CG 
smectic phase, the AA structure does not reveal any ordering 
in the PEO domains, showing instead that PEO chains from 
adjacent layers tend to interdigitate.
To compare the simulated structure to GIWAXS results, 
we calculate the structure factor[73] for the thiophene rings,

with calculated layer thickness of 3.41  nm, and (ii) the two 
peaks originating from the herringbone structure denoted as A 
and B. In Figure 5b, these two peaks represent the alignment 
between the homo-tilts with 0.39  nm spacing and hetero-tilts 
with 0.44 nm spacing in the herringbone packing, respectively 
(the spacing is the mean distance between thiophene ring 
centers of mass).

To simulate the morphology change of 4T/PEO4 with tem-
perature, we heat the system from 37 to 187 °C in 10 °C incre-
ments. At each temperature the system is annealed for 10 ns 
in attempt to achieve equilibrium before taking the next step. 
Figure 5d,e shows the arrangement of 4T units and the corre-
sponding GIWAXS patterns at T = 127 °C which is above the 
disordering transition temperature of 4T/PEO4. At T = 127 °C, 
the top view of the 4T units shows a considerable twisting/
bending compared to that at 27 °C, leading to a significant loss 
of the π–π interaction between the 4T units. Accordingly, the 
simulated GIWAXS pattern in Figure  5e shows no evidence 
of π–π stacking peaks (with only weaker smectic (00h) peaks 
persisting), which is again in agreement with our experimental 
results presented in Section 2.3.
2.5. Structure Evolution of 4T/PEO4 as a Function of Tempera-
ture: A Quantitative Analysis from Experiment and Simulation
To further elucidate the self-assembly behavior of 4T/PEO4, 
we calculate (i) the smectic layer spacing, (ii) the π–π stacking 
distance, and (iii) the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) 
of the smectic peaks as a function of temperature from both 
experimental GIWAXS data and simulation. We also examine 
the conformational change in PEO4 with temperature. To com-
pute the smectic layer spacing and FWHM from experiment, 
we choose to analyze the (002) peak from GIWAXS data for 
having a strong signal and minimal background scattering 
from the direct beam. For the π–π stacking distance, we only 
show data from peak B since either peak A or B yields similar 
trends. Moreover, we choose to analyze the structural evolution 
only during the heating cycle. This is because of the challenges 
posed by the cooling data: in the experiments, the GIWAXS 
peak shape analysis is nontrivial given the appearance of 
extra peaks that overlap with the original smectic and π–π 
stacking peaks; and in the AA simulations, the disorder-to-order 
process is prone to kinetic trapping, rendering unreliable result 
obtained from any practicable cooling rates. Finally, we choose 
to conduct simulations for the r = 0 sample only due to the sim-
ilarity of the self-assembly behaviors of the r = 0, 0.01, and 0.05 
samples as indicated by experimental GIWAXS patterns.
As shown in Figure  6a, a rapid decrease in lamellar dis-
tance is observed for all samples with increasing temperature 
above 47 °C for both experiment and simulation. However, at

137 °C the lamella distance becomes constant at 3.3 nm. To fur-
ther probe the origins of the variation of lamella distance with 
temperature, we also calculate the tilt angle of the thiophene 
and observe a slight increase from 25 ± 3° to 28 ± 4° between 
27 and 47 °C. This change in the tilt angle is accompanied by 
formation of P21/a symmetry in the sample and a decrease of 
lamella thickness with increasing temperature. Furthermore, 
for the PEO4 units we calculate the sphericity (S) defined by 
S  = 3(λ2  + λ3)/2, where the λ1, λ2, and λ3 are eigenvalues of 
the inertial tensor and λ1 > λ2 > λ3;[74] for a stiff rod-like chain 
S  ≈ 0 and for a random coil S  → 1. The sphericity of PEO4 
chains increases slightly (S  = 0.32 → 0.33) from 27 to 47  °C 
and increases rapidly from 57 to 137 °C, plateauing at S ≈ 0.72 
thereafter, as shown in Figure 6b. This rapid increase in sphe-
ricity above 57  °C originates from melting of PEO4 chains 
which contributes to the thinning of the lamella.[75] This per-
sistence of smectic order despite the disordering of the PEO4 
units again shows the stabilizing effect of the π–π interactions. 
Both experimental and simulation results in Figure 6a,b indi-
cate that the PEO4 melting (and the concomitant shrinkage of 
the lamellar spacing) is a continuous order transition and thus 
does not reflect the transition at 93.8 °C observed in DSC.
We characterize the 2D order in real space by calculating the 
2D radial distribution function (in the XY plane) of the center 
of mass of the thiophene rings with homo-tilts and rz < 0.4 nm, 
where rz is the distance between the center of mass of the 
rings parallel to lamella. Figure  6c depicts the changes in rz 
as a function of temperature for both experiment and simula-
tion. It shows that rz slightly increases from 0.44 to 0.45  nm 
between 27 and 97  °C, but increases significantly between 
97 and 137 °C. This transition around 107 °C is due to the loss 
of the herringbone symmetry, and hence the loss of optimal 
π–π interactions and the 2D ordering of thiophene units. 
Figure 6d shows the FWHM of the (002) peak as a function of 
temperature. The order–disorder transition is clearly indicated 
by the abrupt increase in the FWHM around 100 °C. In each 
figure, the gray-shaded area depicts the order–disorder transi-
tion regime of the samples.
2.6. Implication of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI Self-Assembly  
on Ion Transport
The ionic conductivity of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI thin films is meas-
ured by EIS using interdigitated gold electrodes devices (IDEs) 
as shown in Figure  7a. IDEs are used in order to enhance 
signal-to-noise ratio in highly resistive thin films.[76,77] Due to 
the geometry of IDE, the ionic conductivity reported in our 
work is in-plane conductivity, or conductivity in the direction 
parallel to the substrate. In fact, in the smectic phases the 4T/
PEO4-LiTFSI complexes exhibit homeotropic alignment, indi-
cating the formation of 2D ion-conductive pathways parallel 
to the surface of substrate. Figure 7b depicts the temperature-
dependent ionic conductivity of the two samples r = 0.01 and

r = 0.05 during heating and cooling cycles. In the complexes, 
ions propagate through segmental motion of PEO chains. For 
both samples, the conductivity appears qualitatively similar, 
consistent with similar temperature-dependent morphology 
suggested by GIWAXS measurement above. From r = 0.01 to 
0.05, we observe a significant improvement in conductivity 
due to the increase in ionic carrier concentration. During the 
first heating cycle below the transition temperature, the ionic 
conductivity monotonically increases with temperature, con-
sistent with thermally activated ionic transport behavior of 
electrolytes.[78]
The maximum conductivity is ≈1.9 × 10−4 S cm−1 for r = 0.01 
sample (at 90 °C), and 5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 for r = 0.05 sample 
(at 70 °C), which are comparable or even superior to those of 
nanosegregated ionic LCs.[17,18,26,54,79–81] 2D lamellar system 
also has more flexibility in device design in which allows the 
transport of lithium ions within the layers along more direc-
tions compared to 1D cylindrical structures. What’s more, these 
conductivity values from our material are achieved at relatively 
lower temperatures, endowing more practicality and process-
ability to 4T/PEO4. We believe that the high ionic conductivity 
of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI thin films originates from the formation of 
the highly ordered smectic layers and thus efficient 2D trans-
port pathways in the direction parallel to the device substrate 
as suggested by GIWAXS measurements. However, at around 
100 °C where the order–disorder transition takes place, as indi-
cated by the gray-shaded area in Figure 7b, we observe a sub-
stantial drop in ionic conductivity. This is most likely because 
the layered structures and ion transport channels are disturbed 
at this temperature as indicated by the significant broadening 
of the (00h) layering peaks in GIWAXS measurement. This 
behavior has already been reported for a number of columnar 
and smectic ionic LCs.[18,26,54,79–81] Finally, upon cooling the 
samples from above the transition temperature to room tem-
perature, the ionic conductivity does not recover to its initial 
value, which is also consistent with GIWAXS measurements 
suggesting that the conductivity loss is caused by the misalign-
ment of the smectic layers due to local and partial crystallization 
of 4T/PEO4 upon cooling as well as larger grain size obtained 
due to shrunken layer structure and expanded π–π stacking. 
Furthermore, the same measurements were run for another 
two cycles afterward, and the data followed exactly the second 
trend where the ionic conductivity before and after heating/
cooling treatment remains the same. This behavior suggests 
that the LC mesophases and molecular alignments are stable.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have performed a systematic study on the 
structure and self-assembly of newly synthesized conjugated 
LC compound 4T/PEO4 upon blending with LiTFSI in connec-
tion with its ionic conduction characteristics. For the first time 
modeling has played an important role in guiding the design 
and understanding the self-assembly behaviors of the con-
ducting material. We believe that the method using simulation 
to interpret experimental data is an elegant approach toward 
understanding the self-assembly and transport behavior of soft 
materials in general. For all three blend ratios, the compounds 
exhibited a highly ordered smectic phase due to segregation 
between immiscible aromatic and aliphatic segments as well as 
π–π stacking of thiophene rings, forming efficient 2D channels 
for ion transport. EIS measurements on 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI sam-
ples showed remarkable ion transport behavior with the highest 
conductivity of 5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 70 °C and r = 0.05. Tem-
perature-dependent GIWAXS measurements and molecular 
dynamic simulations indicated that upon heating the samples 
from ambient temperature to above the isotropization tempera-
ture, a significant loss in π–π interaction and smectic order was 
observed, which led to a significant drop in ionic conductivity 
due to disruption of the ordered smectic phase and ion trans-
port pathways. Additionally, the conductivity became lower than 
the initial state upon cooling to ambient temperature due to the 
disruption of 2D ion transport channels.
The incorporation of oligothiophene not only provides π–π 
interaction which helps the formation of 2D ion transport 
channel, but also endows electron conducting capability to 
this compound and makes it an even more promising mate-
rial with mixed ionic/electronic conduction characteristics. It 
is known that π-conjugated LCs have great potential as organic

semiconductors,[3,82–84] field-effect transistors,[85–90] and elec-
troluminescence devices[91,92] because of their flexibility, ease 
of processability into thin films, and charge carrier transport 
ability. In fact, Kato and co-workers have already realized this 
idea by synthesizing a molecule consisting of terthienylphe-
nylcyanoethylene mesogen and imidazolium triflate moiety 
which successfully showed electrochromic properties; however, 
no electronic conductivity results were reported.[93] With easily 
attainable ordered structures and a relatively lower viscosity 
compared to conjugated polymers, 4T/PEO4 has significant 
potential of exhibiting mixed ionic–electronic conductivity and 
is the object of ongoing investigations.
4. Experimental Section
Materials and Synthesis: All reagents and solvents were purchased 
from Sigma-Aldrich, AK Scientific, or one click chemistry, and used as 
received unless otherwise noted. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) 
was freshly distilled from sodium and benzophenone prior to use. 
N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) was recrystallized in water and stored in a 
refrigerator before use. The synthetic procedure and characterization of 
4T/PEO4 are provided in the Supporting Information.
Preparation of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI Blend Samples: Solutions of 4T/PEO4 
and LiTFSI (Sigma Aldrich, battery grade) were prepared separately 
by dissolving the materials in anhydrous THF at a concentration 
of 10  mg mL−1 each and fully shaken using a vortexer before mixing. 
4T/PEO4 and LiTFSI solutions were then mixed at the appropriate ratios 
to achieve the concentrations r  = [Li+]/[EO]. DSC, POM images, and 
XRD were taken on bulk 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI complexes prepared by slow 
evaporation of the mixed 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI solution at 80 °C followed by 
drying under vacuum for 24 h at 80 °C.
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), GIWAXS, and ion conductivity 
measurements were performed on 4T/PEO4 thin films spin-cast from 
the mixed solution at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The film thickness of all thin 
film samples is ≈80 nm as confirmed by spectroscopic ellipsometry.
Characterization Methods: NMR: 1H and 13C NMR spectra were 
recorded on a Varian INOVA 400 and a MERCURY 300 spectrometers. 
Chemical shifts were quoted relative to the residual protons of the 
deuterated solvents CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 for 1H and δ = 77.36 for 13C). The 
multiplicity was characterized by the following abbreviations: s-singlet, 
d-doublet, t-triplet, q-quartet, m-multiplet.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry: DSC measurements were performed 
on a Q 2000 from TA Instruments at a scanning rate of 10  °C min−1 
within temperature range from −90 to 250  °C. The phase transition 
temperatures were determined as the peak positions in the DSC traces 
due to broadness of the transition peaks.
Polarized Optical Microscope: An Olympus BX51 polarizing optical 
microscope equipped with a Mettler FP 82 HT hot stage was used for 
visual observation of optical textures at different temperatures.
X-Ray Diffraction and Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering: XRD patterns were 
obtained using Bruker D8 Advance ECO powder diffractometer with 
Cu Kα radiation λ = 1.54 Å. SAXS patterns were obtained using Rigaku 
SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation λ = 1.54 Å.
Grazing-Incidence 
Wide-Angle 
X-Ray 
Scattering: 
Temperature-
dependent GIWAXS measurements were performed at beamline 8-ID-E 
of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory with 
10.86 keV (λ = 1.1416 Å) synchrotron radiation. The temperature of the 
samples was varied from room temperature up to 130 °C using a Linkam 
HFSX350-GI stage. Samples were measured inside a low vacuum 
chamber (10−3 mbar) to minimize concerns about radiation damages, 
samples’ moisture uptake, and extraneous scattering from ambient air. 
The measurement time was chosen to be 3 s frame−1. For each sample, 
three data sets were taken from three adjacent spots on the sample and 
then summed in order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. The samples 
were tilted at an angle of incidence of 0.14° with respect to the incoming 
beam, which is above the estimated critical angle of sample (≈0.13°) 
but below the critical angle of the Si substrates (≈0.17°) in order to 
probe the whole film thickness. The scattering signal was recorded 
with a Pilatus 1MF pixel array detector (pixel size = 172 µm) positioned 
228  mm from the sample. Each data set was stored as a 981  ×  1043 
32-bit tiff image with 20-bit dynamic range. The Pilatus detector has 
rows of inactive pixels at the border between detector modules. In 
order to fill these gaps, after each measurement the detector was 
moved to a new vertical direction and the measurement on each spot 
was repeated, then the gaps were filled by combining the data from two 
detector positions. The signals were reshaped and output as intensity 
maps in qz versus qr ( =

nonuniformity, detection efficiency, the polarization effect, and solid-
angle variation for each image. All the GIWAXS data processing and 
extraction were executed using the GIXSGUI package for MATLAB.[94]
Peak shape analysis was performed on wedge cuts taken with an angular 
breadth of 2°. Each wedge cut was first fit to an empirical baseline function 
to enable the subtraction of the background intensity and amorphous 
scattering. The background-subtracted wedge cut was then fit to a Voigt 
function to extract the peak position and the FWHM of the reflections of 
interest. More details of peak shape analysis can be found elsewhere.[95]
Conductivity Measurements: EIS conductivity measurements were 
performed on samples fabricated on top of custom-built interdigitated gold 
electrode devices (IDE) using a Gamry 600+ Potentiostat inside a nitrogen-
filled glovebox. Prior to EIS measurement, the excess amount of materials 
on the electrode pads was scraped away to make electrical connection 
from the potentiostat to the sample. The electrical connection was made 
using two-probe manipulators (Semiprobe Inc.). The EIS characterization 
was performed from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz with an oscillatory peak potential 
of 50  mV. EIS measurement was carried out at different temperature 
controlled by a miniature benchtop heater controller (Omega Engineering 
Inc.). The collected impedance data were then fit to the appropriate 
equivalent circuit in order to extract the sample ionic resistance Rion and 
then ionic conductivity according to the following equation[76]
