ABSTRACT: The design of high bandgap electrochromic
polymers (ECPs) that switch from a high energy absorbing colored
state to a near-IR absorbing colorless state requires a challenging
balance to be struck between achieving large changes in the
absorption proﬁle while maintaining suﬃciently low oxidation
potentials for use in full-color electrochromic devices. Previous
studies on high bandgap ECPs have investigated structure−
property relationships in dioxythiophenes copolymerized with
various arylenes. Here, we expand this understanding by looking
more closely at the eﬀect of the dioxythiophene moiety as well as
by varying the substituents on the arylene moiety. Three ECPs
have been synthesized to perform this study with repeat units
composed of electron-rich dimethoxyphenylene in alternation with dimers of 3,4-dialkoxy- and 3,4-propylenedioxythiophenes,
yielding high gap polymers that are vibrant yellow or orange in the charge neutral state. Comparing these newly synthesized
polymers to a structurally similar set previously reported, we elucidate the subtle steric and electronic eﬀects that govern bandgap
and redox properties in dioxythiophene copolymers.
■INTRODUCTION
Conjugated polymers have been widely explored for electro-
chromic applications, owing to the ease with which the
coloration and redox properties can be tuned through synthetic
means.1−6 Cathodically coloring cyan, magenta, and yellow
electrochromic polymers (ECPs), as well as numerous
secondary colors, that all switch from a vibrantly colored
state to a colorless (bleached) state upon electrochemical
oxidation have been synthesized, allowing for a broad palette of
vibrant colors, as well as browns and blacks, to be accessible
through blending of ECP solutions.7−11 The use of
dioxythiophene (DOT)-based polymers enables the design of
ECPs that undergo this colored-to-clear transition at low
oxidation potentials. Mechanistically, oxidation of a neutral
polymer leads to the formation of cation radicals (polarons)
and dications (bipolarons), which give rise to conformational
changes of the polymer backbone and a change in the
absorption proﬁle.12 Spectroscopically, this is seen as a decrease
of the neutral π−π* absorption band in the visible range and
the appearance of new charge carrier absorption bands at
longer wavelengths. For the majority of DOT-based ECPs,
these charge carrier absorbances are shifted into the NIR, with
minimal tailing into the visible region resulting in ﬁlms that are
highly transmissive and nearly colorless in their fully oxidized
state. When considering high gap ECPs that are yellow or
orange in their charge neutral states, and hence absorbing in the
350−500 nm range (i.e., above 2.5 eV), the charge carrier
transitions need to be transferred across the entire visible
spectrum into the NIR, as illustrated in Figure 1, for these
materials to become colorless upon oxidation. Attaining this
spectral shift is challenging to accomplish, and as a result most
cathodically coloring yellow EC materials absorb in the long
wavelength range of the visible in their oxidized state, most
often giving rise to a residual blue tint.13−21
In 2010, the homopolymer of bis(ethylhexyloxy)thiophene
(PAcDOT), an orange-to-clear ECP, was reported.22 The
branched alkoxy groups attached directly onto the thiophene
backbone not only aﬀorded high solubility but also induced
enough steric distortion to reduce the extent of conjugation
relative to a fully planar polymer, shifting the λmax to 480 nm
while maintaining a low oxidation potential (ca. 0.5 V vs Ag/
Ag+) as a result of the electron donating oxygens. While the
color and redox properties are in line with the structure−
property relationships we have developed for DOT-based
ECPs,7 the main challenge with this particular high gap polymer
is the relatively long switching time that exceeds 5 s to reach
95% of full optical contrast.
In the following year, the ﬁrst cathodically coloring yellow-to-
colorless ECP, an alternating 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene-alt-
phenylene copolymer (PProDOT-Ph), was reported, complet-

ing the subtractive color palette.23 Compared to other PXDOT-
based electrochromes, PProDOT-Ph is able to maintain a
subsecond switching speed but requires a relatively high
oxidation potential (ca. 1.1 V vs Ag/Ag+) to reach its fully
bleached state, which is attributed to the aromaticity of the
phenylene unit.23 As a result, while PProDOT-Ph could
potentially be used in blends with other ECPs to obtain
various hues,10 or a broadly absorbing black or brown color,9,11
the relatively large potential required to bleach the PProDOT-
Ph component can be beyond the stable limits of other more
easily oxidizable ECPs, which decreases the redox switching
stability of the blend ﬁlms.24,25
In a quest to further tune the redox and color properties of
high gap ECPs, a series of XDOT−arylene copolymers were
designed and synthesized to extract structure−property
relationships between color and oxidation potential with the
goal of yielding a second generation of yellow-to-colorless
switching polymer electrochrome.26 This study yielded seven
new yellow and orange ProDOT-based ECPs and showed that
increasing the electron richness of the arylene, by incorporating
e.g. carbazole (Cbz) or pyrene, or by using dimers of DOTs in
the repeat unit, led to a decrease of the oxidation potential
while maintaining a high bandgap due to steric interactions
between the DOT and the ortho C−H on the arylene. Utilizing
this design logic, the ProDOT was then replaced with a dimer
of the acyclic bis(ethylhexyloxy)thiophene (biAcDOT) to
aﬀord the polymer PAcDOT2-Ph. This balance between sterics
and electron richness gave rise to a polymer with an oxidation
potential 0.3 V lower than PProDOT-Ph, but with an
absorbance proﬁle that is blue-shifted relative to the PAcDOT
homopolymer and with signiﬁcantly faster switching speeds (<2
s).9 While the decreased oxidation potential makes it more
suitable for use in blends with other ECPs, PAcDOT2-Ph
exhibits a ca. 6% decrease in contrast (Δ%T) over a hundred
switches as a result of a decrease in the vibrancy of the colored
state (vide infra). This is a signiﬁcantly faster decrease
compared with the soluble PAcDOT or PProDOT homo-
polymers with the latter demonstrating stability over tens of
thousands or more switches,22,27 but an improvement over the
ﬁrst-generation yellow PProDOT-Ph. As we will show here,
likely explanations for the loss of contrast of PProDOT-Ph and
PAcDOT2-Ph (and other ECPs incorporating phenyl groups in
their repeat unit structure) include the presence of the
unsubstituted phenyl group, through which intermolecular
cross-linking can occur during redox cycling.28−30 Similar
unsubstituted positions have also been proposed to serve as
sites for unwanted chemical reactivity in thiophene-based
polymers during oxidation.31 In addition, we will show that the
nature, as well as the number, of DOTs in the repeat unit
structure also impacts the reactivity of the phenylene moiety
through their eﬀects on steric and electronic properties.
Here, we further build upon the structure−property
relationships of XDOT−arylene copolymers by designing
three new polymers with repeat units of 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-
phenylene in alternation with AcDOT dimers or ProDOT
dimers. We show that these new yellow and orange ECPs can
switch from a ca. 10% transmittance (at λmax) in the colored
state to colorless oxidized states with a transmittance above
65% throughout most of the visible region, while still
possessing low oxidation potentials and redox stabilities
which improve upon current high bandgap ECPs. These new
polymers allow us to compare a family of high gap polymers to
further understand the eﬀect of the nature of the DOT as well
as the substituent eﬀect on the arylene unit on both the colored
and colorless states.
■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Instrumentation. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were collected
on a Varian Mercury Vx 300 MHz instrument using CDCl3 as a
solvent and the residual CHCl3 peak as references (1H: δ = 7.26 ppm;
13C: δ = 77.23 ppm). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was
performed using a Waters HPLC pump 1515, UV−vis detector 2487,
with a refractive index detector 2414 at 35 °C in THF. A Waters
column (4.6 mm × 300 mm; Styragel HR 5E) and polystyrene
standards from Fluka were used. Polymer solutions (10 mg/mL in
THF) were prepared and ﬁltered through a Mini-UniPrep PTFE vial
with a 0.45 μm ﬁlter. 20 μL of each polymer solution was injected, and
molecular weights were calculated using Waters Breeze II software. All
absorption spectra and spectroelectrochemistry were acquired using a
Varian Cary 5000 Scan dual-beam UV−vis−near-IR spectrophoto-
meter. Colorimetry measurements were obtained using Star-Tek
colorimetry software using a D50 illuminant, 2 deg observer, and the
L*a*b* color space. For the solution spectra, all polymers were
dissolved in toluene at room temperature. Electrochemical measure-
ments were carried out using an EG&G Princeton Applied Research
model 273A potentiostat/galvanostat under CorrWare control in a
three-electrode cell conﬁguration, using ITO/glass (Delta Technolo-
gies Inc., 7 × 50 × 0.7 mm, sheet resistance, Rs 8−12 Ω/sq) as the
working electrode, a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode (10 mM AgNO3 in
0.5 M TBAPF6−acetonitrile, E1/2 for ferrocene: 0.125 V), and a Pt ﬂag

as the counter electrode. For diﬀerential pulse voltammetry (DPV)
measurements, the samples were prepared via drop-casting a 0.5 mg/
mL solution onto Pt button electrodes with a surface area of 0.02 cm2.
An electrolyte solution of 0.5 M tetrabutylammonium hexaﬂuoro-
phosphate (TBAPF6, 98%, puriﬁed via recrystallization from hot
ethanol) in propylene carbonate (PC) was used in all electrochemical
and spectroelectrochemical measurements. PC was puriﬁed using a
solvent puriﬁcation system from Vacuum Atmospheres. Films were
spray-cast onto the ITO-coated glass slides using an Iwata airbrush at
25 psi from 2 mg/mL toluene solutions. Films were cast to a uniform
optical density of 1.0 ± 0.03 at λmax rather than uniform ﬁlm thickness.
In previous work, we observed that ﬁlms cast to comparable optical
densities could have very diﬀerent thicknesses and roughness,
depending on the coating method used. In spite of these large
diﬀerences, all ﬁlms exhibited comparable electrochromic contrast and
switching speeds, suggesting that optical density, rather than ﬁlm
thickness, correlates more strongly with a material’s electrochromic
properties.32 Photography was performed in a light booth designed to
exclude outside light with a D50 (5000K) lamp located in the back of
the booth providing illumination, using a Nikon D90 SLR camera with
a Nikon 18-105 mm VR lens.
Materials. Most reagents and starting materials were purchased
from commercial sources and used without further puriﬁcation, unless
otherwise noted. THF, toluene, and propylene carbonate were all
puriﬁed through a Bruker or Vacuum Atmospheres solvent puriﬁcation
system. 3,4-Bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene (AcDOT), 3,3-bis(((2-
ethylhexyl)oxy)methyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine
(ProDOT), 3,3′,4,4′-tetrakis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)-2,2′-bithiophene
(AcDOT2), and PAcDOT2-Ph were synthesized using previous
literature procedures.6,9,22 The synthetic procedure for AcDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2, AcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2-Br2, PAcDOT2-Ph, ProDOT2-Ph-
(OMe)2, and ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2-Br2 as well as the corresponding
NMR spectra can be found in the Supporting Information. The

out under an argon atmosphere unless otherwise mentioned.
PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2. To a 50 mL round-bottom ﬂask equipped

(0.265 g, 1.920 mmol) were added, and a Claisen head was aﬃxed to
the top of the ﬂask that was then vacuum purged for 45 min followed
by three purge and argon backﬁll cycles. 26 mL of N,N-
dimethylacetamide (DMAc) was degassed by bubbling with argon
for 45 min and then injected into the ﬂask to dissolve the contents.
The ﬂask was lowered into an oil bath held at 140 °C and allowed to
stir vigorously for 12 h. After the ﬂask was removed from the oil bath
and allowed to cool to room temperature, the polymer dispersion was
dissolved with chloroform and precipitated into methanol:1 M HCl
(350 mL:75 mL) and stirred for 45 min. The precipitate was ﬁltered
into a Soxhlet extraction thimble and washed with methanol, acetone,
hexanes, and chloroform. The washings were conducted until color
was no longer observed during extraction. After dissolution from the
thimble, the solvent was removed via a rotovap; then 50 mL of
chlorobenzene was added followed by 200 mg of the palladium
scavenger diethylammonium diethyldithiocarbamate and 300 mg of
18-crown-6, and the solution was stirred for 6 h at 50 °C, followed by
precipitation into 300 mL of methanol. The precipitate was ﬁltered
over a 20 μm Nylon pad, washed with 300 mL of pure methanol, and
allowed to dry. PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 was obtained as a yellow solid in
86% (0.90 g) yield.

■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Scheme 1 shows examples of previously studied yellow/orange
polymers (top row) as well as the repeat unit structures of the
new family of high gap copolymers of 2,5-methoxy-1,4-
phenylene polymerized with a variety of DOTs (bottom
row). We will show that the introduction of the bulky and
electron-rich methoxy units in place of the smaller hydrogen
atoms on the phenylene ring raises the HOMO level and
lowers the oxidation potential regardless of the nature of the
DOT unit. For the AcDOT-based polymers, the introduction
of the methoxy units increases the steric hindrance in the
backbone and pushes the bandgap to higher energy. In contrast,
for the ProDOT-based polymers, we show that the
incorporation of methoxy units led to a decrease in the
bandgap and a subsequent red-shift in the neutral state ﬁlm
spectra. Furthermore, we show that the nature of the DOT unit
has a signiﬁcant impact on the position of the charge carriers
bands, with the ProDOT-based polymers exhibiting more red-
shifted bipolaron bands and, as a result, a higher electrochromic
contrast. By combining the two DOTs into a copolymer
(bottom-right structure in Scheme 1), we designed a material
that exhibits the beneﬁcial properties of the orange PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 (low oxidation potential, high electrochromic
contrast, fast switching speed) but with a higher bandgap
similar to PAcDOT2-based polymers. In addition to the
diﬀerences observed in the optical and electrochemical
properties, we show that the high gap polymers that do not
have methoxy-substituted phenyl rings are more susceptible to
degradation over prolonged redox switching.
Polymer Synthesis and Characterization. PAcDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2, PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2, and PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 were prepared by direct arylation (DA) polymer-
ization as illustrated in Scheme 2.33 All the dimethoxypheny-
lene-based copolymers were obtained in high yields (>70%),
with number-average molecular weights (Mn) ranging from
24.1 to 60.2 kDa and dispersities (Đ) ranging from 1.7 to 2.3
after Soxhlet extraction. The monomer synthesis and character-
ization are given in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1).
All three polymers are highly soluble (>10 mg/mL) in common
organic solvents including chloroform, THF, and toluene owing
to the ethylhexyloxy chains on the DOT units. The thermal
stability of the polymers was studied by TGA as shown in
Figure S1, and all of the polymers are found to be stable up to
320 °C.
The polymerizations were initially attempted by a more
intuitive DA polymerization approach than the one ultimately
selected, utilizing biAcDOT or biProDOT with 1,4-dibromo-
2,5-dimethoxybenzene, but these conditions were not success-
ful in obtaining high molecular weight polymers (see Scheme
S2 in the Supporting Information). We attribute this to sterics
that could hinder oxidative addition of the Pd, leading to low
molecular weights. The dibromides should be on the least
sterically hindered site to stabilize oxidative addition and the
proposed transitions states. Oxidative polymerization was also
carried out using AcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 with excess FeCl3 in
ethyl acetate at room temperature and resulted in PAcDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 with a Mn of 11.7 kDa and a dispersity of 3.9, but
led to low yields around 20%, likely due to a large fraction of
low molecular weight oligomers, as detailed in the Supporting
Information (Scheme S3).

Electrochemical and Optical Properties of High Gap
ECPs. The polymers in Scheme 1 possess various structural
motifs that readily allow for ﬁne-tuning of the optical and
electronic properties. Through the variation of the arylene and
DOT units, the onset of oxidation (Eox) can be readily
controlled (as shown in Table 1 and in the diﬀerential pulse
voltammetry (DPV) results in Figure S2) by tuning the
electron-richness and/or the steric strain along the polymer
backbone. By increasing the number of electron-rich DOTs in
the repeat unit, the Eox is substantially lowered. For example,
the addition of a second ProDOT unit in PProDOT2-Ph lowers
the Eox by 260 mV compared to PProDOT-Ph. Similarly, by
replacing the unsubstituted phenylene with the electron-rich
dimethoxyphenylene in PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2, PProDOT-Ph-
(OMe)2, and PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2, the Eox is lowered by 75−
250 mV compared to the unsubstituted analogues. Looking
more closely at the DOT moiety, comparatively, ProDOT units
have less steric hindrance than AcDOT units, leading
homopolymers of the former to have a more relaxed backbone,6
a longer eﬀective conjugation length, and a lower Eox. This
trend is preserved here, as can be observed when comparing the
oxidation potential and optical bandgaps in ﬁlms of
PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 and PProDOT2-Ph with PAcDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 and PAcDOT2-Ph, respectively. By combining these
trends, the lowest Eox of the series is found for PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2. To better understand whether ﬁne control of redox
properties and spectra could be obtained, an alternating
copolymer (PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2) was also synthe-
sized. This copolymer has an Eox and absorption maximum in
between PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 and PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2.
Interestingly, the redox and absorbance proﬁles do not appear
to be simply an overlap from those of the parent polymers,
indicating that the ﬁlm properties are derived from the novel
AcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 repeat unit. These
results suggest that redox and optical properties can be readily
modiﬁed by adjusting the ratio of AcDOT and ProDOT along
the copolymer backbone.
The optical properties of polymer solutions (shown in Figure
S3) and spray-cast thin ﬁlms (shown in Figure 2 and Figure S4)
were analyzed and compared for more insight into the
structural diﬀerences between the AcDOT and ProDOT
polymers. It is interesting to note that for PAcDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 and PAcDOT2-Ph the solution spectra and the
ﬁlm spectra have nearly identical λmax values. For polymers
containing ProDOT, however, a red-shifted absorbance
shoulder is observed in ﬁlm spectra compared to the solution
spectra, with the −Ph(OMe)2-substituted polymers exhibiting
the largest shifts (ca. 40 nm). These new absorbance peaks are
likely the result of aggregation-induced absorbance, which has
been well documented in other thiophene-based polymers.34
One possible explanation is that AcDOT-based polymers
contain a larger degree of twisting because of their bulky side
chains that are located closer to the conjugated backbone and
extend along its plane. As a result, this twisting likely persists
both in solution and in the solid state, leading to comparable
eﬀective conjugation lengths and similar spectra in terms of λmax
and broadness. In contrast, ProDOT analogues have bulky side
chains located further from the conjugated backbone and, due
to the tetrahedral geometry at the central carbon of the
propylene bridge, extend out of the conjugated backbone plane.
This allows the polymer to adopt a more planar geometry in
the solid state, giving rise to the red-shifted absorbance seen in
the ﬁlms. Turning to the PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2
copolymer, it is interesting to note that its solution spectrum
nearly overlaps with that of PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2; however, in
thin ﬁlm it exhibits a more modest red-shift than PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2. The PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 copolymer
adopts some of the relaxation aﬀorded by the ProDOT groups;
however, twisting along the backbone is still conferred by the
AcDOT moieties.
When comparing the optical properties of methoxy-
substituted phenylene polymers with the unsubstituted
analogues, the trend is more complicated: PAcDOT2-Ph-
(OMe)2 has a higher bandgap than PAcDOT2-Ph, while
PProDOT-Ph(OMe)2 and PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2, on the
other hand, have lower bandgaps than the unsubstituted
analogues. With the AcDOT systems, the introduction of
relatively bulky and electron-rich methoxy units in place of the
smaller hydrogen atom on the phenylene ring has a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the backbone planarity/sterics because the side chains
on the AcDOTs extend along the plane of the backbone,
causing them to sterically interact with the methoxy groups.
This leads to greater torsional strain along the backbone, and a
decrease in conjugation, with an accompanying increase in the
bandgap giving rise to a brighter yellow color. In the case of the
ProDOT polymers, the addition of the methoxy groups plays a
smaller role in steric interactions, since the side chains on the
ProDOTs are located further from the methoxy groups and

should not interact with them to a high degree. Instead, the
electron richness of the methoxy groups has a stronger eﬀect on
the HOMO as it lowers the bandgap for PProDOT-Ph(OMe)2
and PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2. This demonstrates that the steric
and electronic eﬀects observed here are intertwined and depend
upon the neighboring groups present and not just on the
substituents themselves.
Spectroelectrochemistry and Color Properties of
High Gap ECPs. The spectroelectrochemical behavior of the
polymers was evaluated by monitoring the absorption changes
upon a simultaneous change of the applied external bias across
the ﬁlms. The spectra of the Ph(OMe)2-based polymers are
shown in Figure 3, whereas the phenyl-substituted analogues
are shown in Figure S5. As the potential is increased, the π−π*
absorption bands (350−550 nm) are depleted, while
absorption bands originating from polaronic and bipolaronic
charge carriers appear. The bipolaron absorption band for the
PAcDOT-based polymers (Figure 3a and Figure S5c) is
signiﬁcantly blue-shifted (λmax: 1400−1500 nm) compared to
the more planar ProDOT analogues (λmax > 1700 nm; Figure
3b,c and Figure S5a,b). The blue-shifted bipolaron band results
in some tailing into the visible range, slightly compromising the
long-wavelength transmissivityand by extension the color
neutralityof the fully oxidized state. When comparing
polymers containing phenyl groups with those containing
−Ph(OMe)2 groups, the bipolaron band is further red-shifted
as a result of the incorporation of the electron-rich substituent
on the phenylenes. This is particularly evident when comparing
the PAcDOT-based polymers (Figure 3a and Figure S5c) but
also observable when comparing the bipolaron absorption
onsets for the PProDOT analogues (Figure 3b,c and Figure
S5a,b). Interestingly, the energy of the polaron band is not
particularly aﬀected by the choice of DOT unit. Additionally,
substitution of the phenylene ring with methoxy groups leads to
a red-shifting of the polaron band for both the AcDOT and
ProDOT copolymers, which is diﬀerent from the trend that
phenyl substitution had on the neutral absorbance. This is likely
because in the oxidized state quinoidalization acts as a greater
driving force to planarization of the polymer backbone than the
side chains have on twisting the polymer out of plane. With a
more planar backbone in all the polymer systems, the electronic
eﬀects of the electron-donating methoxy unit dominate
energetics of the polymer by stabilizing the polaron better
than the unsubstituted phenyl ring, leading to a red-shifting of
the polaron band. The copolymer (Figure 3d) is interesting in
that its neutral state more closely resembles PAcDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2, whereas the oxidized state resembles PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2, again demonstrating how a copolymerization
approach can be used to readily ﬁne-tune the optical properties
by adjusting the ratio of AcDOT and ProDOT along the
backbone.
The maximum transmittance in the oxidized state is found
for the ProDOT-containing polymers. The two PAcDOT
polymers (red and green trace in Figure 4) have a small drop in
transmissivity at ca. 480 nm in their oxidized states, suggesting
that the neutral state is not completely bleached. In addition,
the spectra show some tailing from the NIR at higher
wavelengths from the charge carrier bands. PProDOT-Ph
(black trace) also exhibits a drop in the transmittance plot with
a minimum around 620 nm. Unlike the two PAcDOT-based
polymers, this residual absorbance appears to originate from
residual polarons rather than an incomplete bleaching of the

increased in 10−50 mV steps between the fully colored and bleached states in 0.5 M TBAPF6/PC. The arrows show the progression of the peak
evolution as a function of increasing potential.

neutral state. These trends oﬀer a framework for deriving
structure−property relationships related to the color neutrality
of the fully oxidized state and by extension the optical contrast
(as shown in Table 2) achievable. Of the evaluated polymers,
the orange PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 exhibited the highest
contrast (70 Δ%T at 500 nm) and the most transmissive
oxidized state followed by the copolymer PAcDOT2/
ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2. PProDOT-Ph reaches a similar contrast
as the copolymer if measured at λmax; however, the color
neutrality is compromised by the residual polaron band. The
polymers containing ProDOT units (Figure 3b,c and Figure
S5a,b) exhibit higher optical contrast than their AcDOT
analogues. This is in part the result of their red-shifted charge
carrier bands as discussed above, where the bipolaron bands of
the AcDOT polymers tail into the visible region. Additionally,
the lower contrast of the AcDOT-based polymers can be
ascribed to the high twist (lower degree of planarity) due to
steric hindrance which could make it energetically more
diﬃcult to fully planarize upon electrochemical oxidation.
The contrast of the copolymer PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph-
(OMe)2 (66 Δ%T) is higher than PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 (59
Δ%T) and only slightly lower than PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 (70
Δ%T). This is likely due to the position of its bipolaron band,
which is red-shifted relative to the AcDOT polymer and blue-
shifted relative to the ProDOT polymer, but also due to the
more complete bleaching of the neutral state that is observed
for the copolymer.
To summarize, the contrast values at λmax increase with the
incorporation of ProDOT units as the steric twist is reduced
and the electron richness increased. Similarly, incorporating the
electron-rich −Ph(OMe)2 moiety leads to an increase in the
Δ%T compared to the unsubstituted phenylene polymers, due
in part to the red-shifting these charge carrier bands exhibit as
well as the presence of favorable S−O interactions26,35,36
between neighboring XDOTs and the methoxy groups on
phenylene, facilitating a higher degree of planarity when fully
oxidized.
The colors of the polymers can be quantiﬁed and more
readily compared by converting the spectra into L*a*b* color
coordinates where the L* represents the lightness−darkness
(100−0, white−black) of a given color, a* the red/green
balance, and the b* the yellow/blue balance. The L*a*b*
coordinates for the neutral and oxidized states are summarized
in Table 2. Figure S6 shows how the a*b* values of the
respective polymers change upon electrochemical oxidation
from their fully colored to their fully colorless states.
PProDOT-Ph, PAcDOT2-Ph, and PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 all
have a vibrant yellow color as conﬁrmed by their low a* values
and high b* values. Of the three, PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 is the
purest yellow of the family, having the highest b* and lowest
a*. In addition to being the most vibrant yellow, it also has the
lowest oxidation potential of the three, 250 mV lower than
PProDOT-Ph, which is otherwise very similar in color. By
replacing the AcDOTs with ProDOTs, the steric hindrance
between chains is reduced, leading to a more relaxed backbone.
This in turn causes the neutral state color of PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 and PProDOT2-Ph both to have a slightly red-
shifted absorption proﬁle translating into the colors having a
substantial a* component, placing them in the orange color
space. These two polymers oﬀer a new strategy for obtaining
orange-to-colorless ECPs that have higher electrochromic
contrast, more colorless oxidized states, and (as will be
shown) faster switching speeds than the orange PAcDOT
homopolymer (albeit at a slightly higher potential).22 The color
of the copolymer PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 falls right in
between the parent compounds, giving it a warm golden-yellow
hue. Upon oxidation, all polymers reach a color neutral
transmissive state as demonstrated by the low a*b* values in
Table 2.
In comparing the eﬀects of the diﬀerent heterocycles, it was
also observed that polymers containing ProDOT underwent a
red-shifting of their spectra during repeated cycling to more
red-orange hues. For example, the a*/b* values of PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 shift from an initial 26/55 as sprayed to 47/36 after
10 switching cycles, and drifting further to 47/21 after 1000
switches, as shown spectroscopically in Figure S7. In contrast,
the PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 copolymer spectrum only
undergoes a slight red-shift, while the spectra of PAcDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 before and after repeated cycling are nearly
identical. This trend reﬂects the tendency of ProDOT-
containing polymers to relax their torsional strain and achieve
a more planar backbone after repeated redox switching, as
discussed above, while AcDOT-containing polymers remain
highly twisted due to the sterics aﬀorded by the branched alkyl

the subtle relationship between sterics and electron-richness,
redox potentials can be adjusted while the desired coloration
can be retained across two structurally diﬀerent materials.
Switching Kinetics of High Gap ECPs. To evaluate the
rate at which the bleaching/coloration processes occur in spray-
cast ﬁlms, the transmittance change at λmax was monitored as a
function of time by applying square-wave potential steps for
periods of 60, 30, 10, 5, 3, 1, and 0.5 s, as shown in Figure 5 for
the new polymers (PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2, ProDOT2-Ph-
(OMe)2, and PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2) and in Figure
S8 for the previously published polymers (PProDOT-Ph,
PProDOT2-Ph, PProDOT-Ph(OMe)2, and PAcDOT2-Ph).
The two AcDOT-containing polymers complete 95% of a full
switch between 2 and 3 s, while the ProDOT-containing
polymers exhibit faster switching kinetics, all undergoing a full
switch in a second or less. The slower switching speeds of the
AcDOT-based polymers compared with their ProDOT-based
analogues are more clearly delineated in Figure 5d, which
shows an overlap of the chronoabsorptometry curves during a
10 s switch. This is in line with what was previously observed
when comparing PAcDOT and PProDOT homopolymers.22,37
Interestingly for the PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 copoly-
mer, the switching speeds more closely resemble those of
PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 than the AcDOT analogue. This is in
contrast to its optical and redox properties, which were almost
in the middle of its parent polymers’ properties. While the exact
structure−property relationships aﬀecting redox switching
speeds are not fully understood, evidently the presence of the
ProDOT moieties is suﬃcient to induce a noticeable
enhancement.
To evaluate the eﬀect that DOTs, as well as substituents on
the phenyl units, have on cross-linking and/or nucleophilic
attack at the open positions of the phenyl ring,28−31 ﬁlms were
monitored with repeated square-wave potential steps of 10 s,
switching between the fully reduced and fully oxidized states for
100 cycles under ambient laboratory conditions (i.e., in the
prescence of light, O2, and humidity). From this, several trends
are observed. First, as shown in Figure 6 and Figure S9b,f, when
comparing PProDOT-Ph and PProDOT2-Ph, as well as
PProDOT-Ph(OMe)2 and PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2, increasing
the number of DOTs in the repeat unit leads to an
improvement in maintaining contrast over 100 switches. With
a higher density of electron-rich units, the cation radical and
dication states are better stabilized, leading to a decrease in
reactivity of these species. Similarly, in examining the eﬀects of
phenyl ring substitution, when comparing PAcDOT2-Ph-
(OMe)2 with PAcDOT2-Ph, the absence of the methoxy
units leads to a nearly 6% decrease in electrochromic contrast
over the course of 100 cycles as a result of the colored state
losing vibrancy, while the methoxy-substituted version loses
4%. This trend is also evident for the ProDOT-containing
polymers, where PProDOT2-Ph loses 3% contrast over the
course of 100 cycles whereas PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 only loses
0.3%. This improvement upon methoxy substitution can be
attributed to unsubstituted phenylene rings being more
susceptible to irreversible cross-linking or nucleophilic attack
during repeated electrochemical switching.28−30 Finally,

ProDOT-based polymers appear to be more robust than the
AcDOT analogues, which can be observed when comparing
PAcDOT2-Ph with PProDOT2-Ph or PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2
with PProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2. Computational studies on DOTs
have previously shown that AcDOT moieties are twisted far out
of plane from one another due to torsional strain arising from
their side chains extending along the plane of the conjugated
backbone.6 On the other hand, ProDOT moieties are less
twisted as the side chains extend out of the plane of the
conjugated backbone. This large twist between AcDOT and the
phenyl moiety can leave the phenyl ring more exposed to
attack, while the more coplanar ProDOT can sterically shield
the phenyl ring from side reactions.
Interestingly, in both PProDOT-Ph(OMe)2 and PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 the decrease in contrast over 100 switches occurs in
a diﬀerent fashion from the AcDOT polymers. As was
exempliﬁed in the discussion of the color coordinates in
Table 2, the absorbance proﬁle of the orange PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 undergoes a red-shift during prolonged cycling
(1000+ switches). In addition to this shift, we observed an
unexpected decrease in switching speed, with the ﬁlm requiring
approximately 1 min to switch to the fully colored state, as
shown in Figure S10; nevertheless, when aﬀorded enough time
to switch, the colored and colorless states could be fully
recovered even after several thousand redox cycles. While this
phenomenon is not yet fully understood, it seems to suggest
that the ion and/or electron diﬀusion in the ﬁlms becomes
slower over repeated cycling, rather than the polymer
undergoing chemical side reactions which would not otherwise
be reversible.
■CONCLUSION
Here, we have reported on the synthesis, characterization, and
structure−property relationships of high bandgap polymers
based on repeat units of electron-rich dimethoxyphenylene in
alternation with AcDOT dimers or ProDOT dimers. We show
that the introduction of electron-rich methoxy units in place of
the smaller hydrogen atom on the phenylene raises the HOMO
level, allowing the polymer to be fully oxidized at a lower
potential, while also providing improved redox stability and
higher electrochromic contrast, when copolymerized with
DOTs. However, with the AcDOT systems, the presence of
the methoxy units increases the steric hindrance in the
backbone and pushes the optical bandgap toward higher
energy, in contrast to the trend observed in the ProDOT
analogues. This complexity ultimately allows for ﬁne-tuning
with regards to the electronic, steric, and optical eﬀects of the
resulting polymer ﬁlms. Incorporating the two DOTs into a
PAcDOT2/ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 copolymer combines the low
oxidation potential and high EC contrast of PProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 with the higher bandgap of PAcDOT2-based
polymers, thus giving rise to a yellow copolymer with fast
switching kinetics, high contrast (>65%), and improved
electrochemical stability. From this understanding, ECPs were
obtained with yellow and orange neutral states that switch to
colorless oxidized states. The incorporation of the protecting
methoxy groups on the phenylene rings improves upon
previous designs of high bandgap ECPs, bringing the ﬁeld
closer to having a full color palette of stable, high-performance
ECPs.
