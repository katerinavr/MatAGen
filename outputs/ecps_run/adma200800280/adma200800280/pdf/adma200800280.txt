Spray Processable Green to Highly Transmissive
Electrochromics via Chemically Polymerizable
Donor–Acceptor Heterocyclic Pentamers**
By Pierre M. Beaujuge, Stefan Ellinger, and John R. Reynolds*
The concept of valence and conduction band broadening
based on alternating electron rich and poor moieties in con-
jugated polymers was introduced in 1993 by Havinga et al.[1]
With the ability to obtain energy gaps as narrow as 0.5 eV, a
new dimension was added to the notion of band gap engi-
neering and the ‘‘donor-acceptor’’ theory on a macromolecular
level was born. In spite of the considerable impact of this
discovery for device applications such as ﬁeld-effect transis-
tors,[2–4] light emitting diodes[5] and photovoltaics,[6–9] only
recently has the use of donor-acceptor based conducting
polymers attracted the attention of research groups with an
interest in electrochromic polymers (ECPs).[10–14] On the other
hand, the last two decades have seen a particular stress placed
on incorporating ECPs as fast and reversible color changing
materials in devices such as windows, mirrors and displays.[15]
While a number of neutral state red and blue conjugated
polymers were synthesized and their properties investi-
gated,[16–18] attempts in making saturated green polymers,
chemically or electrochemically synthesized, have met limited
success[15] due to the complex nature of the required
absorption spectrum that must contain at least two bands in
the neutral state of the material.
In 2004, Wudl et al. reported on completing the additive
primary color space: red, green and blue (RGB), with the ﬁrst
promising neutral green conjugated ECP, a donor-acceptor
based material which exhibited a high degree of stability upon
electrochemical switching.[19] Even though a soluble version of
the neutral green polymer was achieved,[20] the persistent
brown hue of its oxidized state remained an obstacle that could
not be overcome.[15,20]
In recent work[13] from Toppare et al. published during the
preparation of this manuscript, the donor-acceptor 4,7-di(2,3-
dihydro-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole
(BEDOT-BTD), the synthesis and electrochemical properties
having previously been reported,[21–23] was electropolymerized
and its subsequent polymer (PBEDOT-BTD) was re-investigated
as a possible candidate for electrochromic applications. The
insoluble polymer ﬁlm was revealed to be a neutral state green
material switching rapidly and reversibly to a transmissive light
blue oxidized state,[13] an experimental result strongly support-
ing the utility of the donor-acceptor theory in the design of
neutral green ECPs.
Herein, we report our approach for engineering soluble and
processable neutral state green conjugated polymers of tunable
hues which possess highly transmissive oxidized states, fast
switching times, redox switching stability and excellent optical
contrasts both in the visible and in the near infra-red (NIR)
(Fig. 1). The synthesized green polyheterocyclics exhibit a
repeat unit designed for two-band absorption in the visible
whose molecular structure can be synthetically adjusted in
order to tailor the energy gap and control the green hue of the
polymer, a desirable property for applications in displays.
Complete characterization in terms of structural and physical
properties, as well as practical integration of ECPs into devices,
requires solution-processability, which is not attained with the
commonly insoluble electropolymerized materials. Here, the
reported materials can easily be processed into electrochromic
devices using convenient deposition methods such as spin
coating and spray casting.
To achieve a neutral state green polymer, it is necessary to
have a material that absorbs both red and blue light. Fine
tuning of the energy gap, along with introduction of an adequate
set of absorption bands in the visible spectrum, can be obtained
by controlling the structure of the repeat unit that composes the
conjugated material. Based on the theoretical work of Salzner et
al. in addressing the relevance of the Donor–Acceptor approach
for designing organic metals,[24,25] systems involving two distinct
energy transitions are rationalized by considering the presence of
low-lying unoccupied and localized energy levels within the band
gap of the conjugated system in its ground-state. These locali-
zed energy levels are easily accessed from the valence band and
should have little electron density on the donor substituents thus
forming a discrete energy ‘‘band’’ (whose contribution would
stem from the most electron poor heterocycle) lying beneath the
conduction band in the orbital correlation diagram of the
conjugated polymer.[25] The consequences of these assump-
tions on the optical spectrum of the undoped material
described are two-fold: 1) low energy transitions from the
valence band to the low lying unoccupied and localized energy
levels result in a long wavelength absorption band 2) higher

energy transitions from the valence band to the ‘‘true’’ con-
duction band are responsible for the presence of a distinct
blue-shifted absorption band in the visible spectrum. In addi-
tion, for a polymeric material transmitting/reﬂecting green
light, obtaining a highly transmissive state upon oxidation is an
additional major difﬁculty due to the requirement for simul-
taneous and efﬁcient bleaching of the two absorption bands
that occurs in the blue and red portions of the visible region.
Figure 1 illustrates our approach for designing conjugated
polymers with a two-band absorption in the visible so as to
reﬂect and transmit the color green in the neutral state. At the
same time, these polymers attain high transmissivity upon
complete oxidation along with being solution-processable.
Here, the acceptor 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole is symmetrically
functionalized with different thiophenic donor substituents
using repeated Stille couplings.[26–29] While the ﬁrst substitu-
tion is expected to have the largest impact on the energy gap of
the donor-acceptor system, a second substitution with a
3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) allows ﬁne energy
tuning and substantial control over the two-band absorption
spectrum of the resulting oligomer (see Supporting Informa-
tion). Polymerization of the heterocyclic pentamers gives a
distinct optical (red) shift conveniently anticipated by results
from various research groups.[30–33] In addition, as demon-
strated earlier in our group,[34,35] alkoxy-derivatized ProDOT
based polymers exhibit sub-second switching times, high EC
contrast ratios, redox switching stability, transmissivity of the
oxidized state, and a particular ease in synthesis that raises the
synthon as a logical building unit in the design of heterocyclic
precursors
for
colored
to
transparent
switching
ECPs.
Regiosymmetric alkoxy-substituted ProDOTs also possess a
low oxidation potential so that mild oxidizing agents can be
used for polymerizing the designed oligomers which limits the
risks of cross-linking occuring during the polymerization and
induces solution-processability to the subsequent polymers.
Polymers A and B (Fig. 1) were respectively achieved via
chemical polymerization of the donor-acceptor based hetero-
cyclic pentamers A and B making up the repeat unit of their
subsequent polymeric analogues. Experimentally, it was found
that symmetric addition of ProDOT on the donor-acceptor
trimeric precursors (highlighted orange in Fig. 1) induces a
bathochromic shift in the range 55–62 nm for the lower
wavelength absorption band and 75–78 nm for the longer
wavelength band (see Supporting Information). Polymeriza-
tion adds a more signiﬁcant red shift of about 80 nm for the
lower wavelength transition, while ranging from 120 to 150 nm
for the higher one (Fig. 2a). In solution, both polymers are
green and show minor optical changes upon increase of the
temperature between room temperature and 100 8C indicating
neither signiﬁcant disruption of effective conjugation[36,37] nor
major aggregation of the backbones once solvated.[38,39] The
key incorporation of regiosymmetric ProDOTs bearing two
octyloxy solubilizing chains induces sufﬁcient solubility (up to
about 8 mg mL1 in the case of polymer A) for solid thin ﬁlm
processing using common organic solvents. While polymer A
shows good to excellent solubility at room temperature in
toluene, chloroform and ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB),
polymer B requires hot mixtures of toluene and chloroform
(60 8C) or hot ODCB (80–100 8C) to be efﬁciently dissolved in
solution.
Films of polymer A and B were spray-cast onto ITO-coated
glass slides from room temperature solvents, and subsequently
redox cycled until they reached a stable and reproducible
switch prior to spectroelectrochemical analysis. As the poten-
tial applied to the ﬁlm is increased from 0.3 V (versus Fc/Fcþ)
for polymer A, 0.6 V for polymer B, simultaneous bleaching
of both the low and high energy transitions is initiated (Fig. 2b
and c). These values are consistent with the low onsets of
oxidation of polymers A and B respectively estimated at 0.3 V
and 0.55 V via differential-pulse voltammetry (see the
Supporting Information). As the short and long wavelength
absorption bands are depleted, new transitions progressively
arise in the NIR indicating the formation of the charge carriers.
Determined from the onset of their lowest energy p–p*
transitions, polymer A exhibits a band gap at 1.47 eV and
polymer B shows a more narrow value of 1.42 eV as expected
considering that 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) brings a
higher energy HOMO than thiophene to the conjugated
donor-acceptor system. When fully oxidized, both polymers
show a high level of transparency to the human eye. Upon full
oxidation the bipolaronic transition of polymer B, clearly more
red-shifted in the NIR, tails less into the visible hence inducing
a higher electrochromic contrast. From this data and taking the
longer wavelength absorption maximum as a reference as it
interacts with the near infrared tail of the fully doped polymer,
a transmittance change up of about 32% for polymer A versus
53% for polymer B is calculated, indicative of the higher
contrast observed for the latter polymer.

Information).

The relative luminance change, estimating the brightness of
the transmitted light as a percentage of the brightness of the
light source, was measured as the doping level induced by
electrochemical oxidation was progressively increased (Fig. 3).
From their neutral green to fully oxidized transmissive state,
the spray-cast polymers exhibit a relative luminance change of
approximately 30%, a promising value considering that the
light-adapted human eye is most sensitive to forest-green, a
tone that almost equally stimulates two of the three kinds of
cone cells in the eye and that is consequently likely to be
perceived regardless of its intensity. It is worth noting that
relative luminance can also be modulated and optimized as a
function of deposited ﬁlm thickness. The materials in their
neutral state exhibit a saturated green, a fact supported by the
very negative a* values obtained, but they show different hues
as characterized by the signiﬁcantly different b* values.[40] For
instance, the large positive b* value for polymer B translates
the yellow tone of its green. L* values (ranging from 0 to 100)
such as those exhibited by Polymer A (L* ¼ 91) and B
(L* ¼ 89) upon oxidation demonstrate their aptitude to nearly
reach the ‘‘white point’’ (W) of color space. In the oxidized
state, a* and b* drop down to orders as low as 3 (polymer A)
and 5 (polymer B) yielding corresponding tints that can
hardly be perceived by the human eye. The polymers complete
their full switches in a potential window of less than 1.5 V, a
parameter of signiﬁcant interest for low-voltage device
applications. The window necessary to achieve more than
90% of the optical change is considerably narrower: as low as
1.05 V for Polymer A and 1.15 V for Polymer B.
The contrast ratios (%DT) were monitored as a function of
time at the longer wavelength absorption maximum of each

material applying square-wave potential steps of 10 s, 2 s, and
1 s in order to characterize their respective response time
(Fig. 4a and b). As predicted by the spectroelectrochemical
study, the ﬁlm of polymer B exhibits higher contrasts (44–40%)
than polymer A (39–36%), although in either case a variation
in electrochromic contrast of only 3 to 4% is observed as the
switch time is increased from 10 to 1 second. Measured at the
shorter wavelength absorption maximum of polymer A and B,
%DT was estimated at 27% and 45%, respectively.
A new ﬁlm of polymer A was spray-coated onto ITO and its
stability upon square-wave potential stepping electrochromic
switching was investigated in 0.1 M LiBF4/propylene carbo-
nate solution using a switch time of 2 s (see the Supporting
Information). At the longer wavelength absorption maximum,
a loss of eletrochromic contrast of only 5.5% is estimated after
1000 cycles along with no signiﬁcant change in coloration
efﬁciency (CE) which indicates the proper relationship
between charge stored (calculated from integration of the
current) and contrast observed. This result is signiﬁcant
considering the nature of the substrate used, and the redox
induced solubility of the polymer in the electrolyte, as there is
little to prevent the chains from slowly migrating away from the
working electrode to the platinum counter electrode during
the experiment. In order to highlight the inﬂuence of the sub-
strate on stability studies, long term switching was also inves-
tigated on a Pt button electrode (Fig. 4c). While the decay in
charge stored per unit area of spray-coated ﬁlm of polymer A is in
the order of 5.5% onto ITO, a ﬁlm drop-cast on Pt shows about
2% loss after 1000 cycles, about 3% after 2000 cycles and less
than 5% after 10 000 cycles (nearly 24 hours) which reinforces
the potential of this ECP for commercial applications.
In conclusion, two new symmetrical donor-acceptor hetero-
cyclic pentamers were designed, synthesized and chemically
polymerized affording organic soluble neutral state green
conjugated polymers of different hues adequate for RGB
realization. Optical and electrochemical investigation of the
green conjugated polymers revealed highly transmissive
oxidized states, excellent optical contrasts both in the visible
and in the NIR, small potential windows of operation, fast
switching times and long-term stability. Such remarkable
properties combined with the convenient ability to process the
ﬁnely engineered hybrids into solid thin ﬁlms upon spin coating
and spray casting leave the doors for dual ECP, photovoltaic
and NIR device applications wide open.
