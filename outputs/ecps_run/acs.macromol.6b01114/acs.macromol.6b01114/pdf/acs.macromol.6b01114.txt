ABSTRACT: A family of ﬁve electrochromic polymers (ECPs) based on 3,4-dioxythiophenes (XDOTs) (where X = ethylene
(E) and propylene (Pro)) or a 3,4-diacyclic-substituted dioxythiophene (AcDOT, Ac) as main chain donors coupled in a random
fashion with the sterically relaxed (i.e., low torsional energy barriers to planarity) donor−acceptor−donor unit EDOT−BTD−
EDOT (EBE, BTD = 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) were synthesized using direct heteroarylation polymerization conditions. Designed
as broadly light absorbing materials to improve overall contrast, ECPs were solution spray-cast into thin ﬁlms, and their
electrochromic properties were measured and compared against the previously reported ECP-Black (random copolymer
composed of ProDOT and BTD). These new polymers exhibit enhanced integrated contrasts across the visible region (380−780
nm, Δ%Tint) larger than 45%, the highest achieved being ∼52%, a substantial improvement over ECP-Black (Δ%Tint = ∼32%).
Increasing torsional strain of the main chain donor units moves the short wavelength peak to higher energy, allowing hue control.
Increasing the composition of the EBE monomer in random copolymers yields more level and uniform absorption across the
visible, reducing hue saturation and giving more muted colors relative to the normally vibrantly colored ECPs with no observable
loss in contrast. Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 gave the highest integrated electrochromic contrast with color values (L*a*b* where L*
indicates lightness, a* deﬁnes green and red, and b* deﬁnes blue and yellow hues, for negative and positive values, respectively),
indicating improved color neutrality (45, 5, 3) when compared to ECP-Black (47, 3, −14). Two-component solution blends of
Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 with the previously reported all donor polymer ProDOT2-EDOT in diﬀering weight ratios were prepared and
cast into ﬁlms giving more aesthetically pleasing black-to-transmissive electrochromes, while maintaining a high integrated
contrast at ∼51%. The use of EBE demonstrates the synthetic capability to improve the contrast of broadly absorbing ECPs for
black or dark-to-transmissive applications in electrochromic window and display-type devices.
■INTRODUCTION
Electrochromism (EC) is a phenomenon described as the
ability of a material to change its electromagnetic absorptive
properties with the application of a current or voltage. The
most practical color change is from an absorptive colored state
to a transmissive, colorless one, enabling light to be
continuously modulated. A range of well-studied materials
(transition metal oxides, Prussian Blues, small organic
molecules, and π-conjugated polymers) demonstrate this
phenomenon, giving it the potential to revolutionize
technologies spanning from displays, signage, windows,
security, camouﬂage, and wearable fabrics.1−4
In the quest to develop electrochromic windows or eyewear
with black or dark colored states that switch to transmissive
colorless forms, metal oxides have dominated the ﬁeld with
complementary device architectures. In a metal oxide-based
electrochromic device (ECD) in the colored state, cathodically
coloring tungsten oxide (absorbing long wavelength light when
reduced) and anodically coloring nickel oxide (or vanadium
oxide, both materials absorbing short and medium wavelength

light when oxidized) electrochromes color-mix to achieve an
aesthetically pleasing and highly color-neutral (black) hue.5,6
Transition metal oxide materials, however, typically take
relatively long times to complete a full switch and tend to
require elevated temperatures during preparation, making it
diﬃcult to employ them on ﬂexible conducting plastic
substrates.7 Recently, however, studies involving inkjet
printing,8−10 sputtering,11 nanopaper transfer methods,12 and
even electrochemical deposition with high ﬁlm contrast and
good cycling rates13 are showing great promise.
While the speed of switching is a minor concern for EC
windows for architectural uses in oﬃces and homes, this slow
switching is not as viable for applications such as eyeglasses,
goggles, pilot/athletic visors, or automotive/aircraft wind-
shields, along with reﬂective displays and signs, where
subsecond color to colorless switches are desirable and, in
some instances, practically necessary. Prussian blue (PB)14 and
viologen15 species can exhibit high speed switching; however,
the PB reduced colorless state is unstable to oxygen, making
ambient device construction diﬃcult at scale while having long
lifetimes in mind. The “Gentex-like” technology utilizing
viologen, where the electrochrome is a small molecule dissolved
in an electrolyte, is self-clearing but due to diﬀusion has no EC
memory.
Throughout the recent decade, π-conjugated electrochromic
polymers (ECPs) have demonstrated their facility in color
tuning as a result of structural modiﬁcation of the polymer’s
repeat unit,16,17 color mixing via solution blending of primary
colored ECPs,18,19 and device architectures which allow color
control of EC ﬁlms independently of one another.20,21 As ECPs
are typically solution coated as ﬁlms which can be imbibed with
supporting electrolyte,22 they exhibit the ability to switch with
high contrast more rapidly than metal oxides, with typical times
on the order of a second for small (cm2) devices.23 Along with
the ability to tune the optical properties, ECPs can be
processed into thin ﬁlms using roll-to-roll techniques,24,25 and
modiﬁcation of material solubility is achievable via postprocess-
ing functionalization.26,27 Methods also exist to enable ECP
aqueous processing with subsequent conversion to solvent-
resistant forms, yielding fast electrochromic switching ki-
netics.28,29
To match the broadly absorbing black and neutral colors
achieved by the metal oxides using a single ECP, a random
backbone architecture has been employed where donor−
acceptor (D−A) interactions are used to absorb long
wavelength light, while varied lengths of donor segments
absorb medium to short wavelength light. Using 3,4-propylene-
dioxythiophene (ProDOT) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD),
spectral broadness was ﬁrst synthetically achieved in 2008 by
Beaujuge et al.30 via the random oxidative polymerization of a
ProDOT monomer with ter-heterocyclic ProDOT-BTD-
ProDOT comonomer. Greater color neutrality was achieved
by broadening of the absorption spectrum in the visible region
as reported by Shi et al.,31 who employed a Stille polymer-
ization, which allowed access to shorter segments of oligo-
ProDOTs in a chain, absorbing more blue light, and thereby
achieving a more black neutral state in a polymer referred to
below as “ECP-Black”. Additional chemically polymerized
black-to-transmissive ECPs have been reported since.32−34
The same broadening eﬀect for black-to-transmissive electro-
chromism has also been achieved through the electro-
polymerization of monomers that utilize donor−acceptor−
donor (D−A−D) interactions.35−38 Individual ECPs and
blends with exceptional achromaticity have been published
but unfortunately lack adequate transmission upon oxidation to
be suitable in high contrast ECDs.39−42 Further, dark-to-
transmissive devices were achieved through the use of polymer
blends43 or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxthiophene) (PEDOT)
coupled with a yellow organic dye.44
The black-to-transmissive polymers detailed above possess a
considerable degree of residual absorption in their transmissive
states, leading to low visible light contrast during electro-
chromic switching. Many ophthalmic tints and coatings45,46
indicate a requirement for integrated contrast (Δ%Tint) across
the visible of >50%, a value that ECP-Black is unable to meet.
This low contrast may be a result of reduced delocalization of
charge carriers across the acceptor moiety in the polymer
backbone, as observed with D−A-based ECP systems.47,31
Carefully considering this, the reduced delocalization may be
attributed to ortho C−H steric interactions between the
hydrogens on BTD and the OCH2 units on the seven-
membered ring of neighboring ProDOTs. This is the likely
steric interaction that would give a higher energy barrier to
planarity, resulting in quinoidal oxidized states that do not
adequately delocalize charge carriers.
In the work reported here, we seek to achieve both an
achromatic/black neutral state and increased charge delocaliza-
tion in the oxidized state in a random copolymer, eﬀectively
red-shifting more of the residual red-light absorption of the
most oxidized transmissive state into the near-infrared,
absorbing less long wavelength visible light, and consequently
enhancing contrast across the visible spectrum.
Based on previous reports on colored-to-transmissive
ECPs,48,49 high electrochromic contrast can be achieved at
the D−A charge transfer (CT) peak by ﬂanking an aromatic
electron acceptor with sterically (torsionally) relaxed EDOTs.50

We hypothesize that this method will enhance charge carrier
delocalization, leading to a greater transmission of long
wavelength visible light in the ECP’s oxidized state. Herein,
we explore an EDOT ﬂanked BTD acceptor (EDOT-BTD-
EDOT, EBE) and its incorporation into random copolymers,
which results in improved contrast of black-to-transmissive
ECPs. Films produced from coprocessing a pair of carefully
selected polymers result in a ﬂat spectral proﬁle and an
aesthetically pleasing indigo-black hue.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
An approach for producing ECPs with random length
chromophores and relaxed steric interactions between EBE’s
and substituted 3,4-dioxythiophenes (XDOTs) is illustrated in
Scheme 1, where x and y represent comonomer ratios. The blue
or green spheres represent either ProDOT or AcDOT; the
color representation in the scheme only indicates a diﬀerence.
Our use of the EBE ter-heterocycle ensures that the BTD
acceptor will always be ﬂanked by the less-sterically demanding
six-membered rings from the two EDOTs (as opposed to the
seven-member ring in ProDOT) in random copolymerizations.
We hypothesize that once fully oxidized, this will allow for
greater planarization across the D−A−D segment, improving
delocalization of charge carriers, red-shifting the charge carrier
transitions, imparting higher transmittance to the oxidized
forms, and thus increasing electrochromic contrast. Calcu-
lations of the torsional energy barrier to rotation between
dimers of BTD and EDOT/ProDOT are shown in Figure S1a.
Computational studies were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G
+(d, p) and MP2/cc-pVTZ level of theory51,52 using the
Gaussian 09 package.53 From their lowest relative energy
conformation (0°, Figures S1c−f are taken from angles greater
than this conformation) in the neutral state, the BTD-EDOT
dimer exhibits a higher torsional energy barrier to twisting away
from planarity than BTD-ProDOT. Thus, the calculations
support improved “relaxation” or conjugation when EDOTs are
ﬂanking BTD vs ProDOTs. The EBE ter-heterocycle was
synthesized using direct arylation coupling methods,54 followed
by puriﬁcation via sublimation, and washing the resulting red
solid with methanol. All polymers in this study were
synthesized via direct (hetero)arylation polymerization
(DArP). The ﬁnal structures are shown in Scheme 2 (speciﬁc
synthetic methods used can be found in the Supporting
Information). Polymer molecular weight was analyzed with gel-
permeation chromatography (GPC) in chloroform (results
shown in Figure S2), and the number weight-average,
dispersity, and degree of polymerization (Mn (kDa), PDI, Xn)
relative to polystyrene standards are as follows: Ac-Ac/EBE
(27.9, 2.10, 40), Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30 (41.9, 3.38, 52), Pro-Ac0.65/
EBE0.35 (44.7, 4.48, 55), Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 (50.9, 3.20, 64), and
Pro-Pro/EBE (68.0, 3.17, 78). Ac-Ac/EBE has the lowest
weight, a kinetic eﬀect, which may be attributed to a steric
barrier to oxidative addition of the bulkier aryl dibromide,
resulting in reduced conversion (Xn) and lower Mn. As the
steric barrier is reduced with addition of ProDOTs, the
molecular weights increase. The molecular weights obtained
were suﬃcient to cast thin solid ﬁlms onto indium tin oxide
(ITO)-coated glass for electrochromic characterization.
In this report, two sets of polymerization approaches were
used to achieve polymers with the same monomer components,
but diﬀerent primary structures, leading to diﬀerent properties,
and this is illustrated in Figure 1. In the ﬁrst set, the sterically
relaxed internal D−A−D monomer (EBE) was used in a molar
ratio of 0.25, while the molar ratios for the external DOT units
were varied, increasing external strain by raising AcDOT (Ac)
content (vs ProDOT (Pro) content), in the polymers Pro-Pro/
EBE to Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 to Ac-Ac/EBE (subscripts indicate
molar ratios). In thin solid ﬁlms, these polymers produce dual-
band absorptions where the position of the λmax of the D−A
peak50 was essentially ﬁxed, and the shorter wavelength π-to-π*
peak was hypsochromically shifted with increasing backbone
strain from AcDOT. In the second set, external strain was
relatively ﬁxed, and the ratio of internal D−A−D monomer
EBE was increased from 0.25 to 0.35 equiv starting from Pro-
Ac0.75/EBE0.25 to Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30 to Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35.
Here, because Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 was able to absorb the most
light across the visible spectrum with higher contrast than Ac-
Ac/EBE and similar contrast compared to Pro-Pro/EBE, this
mixed-DOT Pro-Ac/EBE copolymer architecture was selected
as the starting structure from which to measure the eﬀect of
changes in EBE content. Though Pro-Pro/EBE does indeed

have the highest contrast of all materials, herein it is not the
most broadly absorbing.
Redox Behavior. To determine the eﬀects that variation of
backbone strain and EBE content have on the electrochemical
oxidation onset, cyclic voltammetry (CV, Figure S3) and
diﬀerential pulse voltammetry (DPV, Figure S4) were
performed on drop-cast ﬁlms on platinum button electrodes.
Prior to measurements, ﬁlms were cycled ﬁve times between
−500 and 800 mV to condition the materials to the inﬂux of
electrolyte and subsequent change in optoelectronic proper-
tiesso-called electrochemical break-in. The oxidation poten-
tial onsets via DPV presented in both Table 1 and Figure S3
give an increasing trend of 13 to 110 to 180 mV for Pro-Pro/
EBE to Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 to Ac-Ac/EBE, respectively,
correlating with increasing torsional strain along the conjugated
backbone. As the content of EBE was increased, there is a
decrease in oxidation potential from 110 to 50 to −45 mV for
Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 to Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30 to Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35,
respectively, which is attributed to increasing EDOT content.
Thin Film Spectroscopy. Prior to optical characterization
of ﬁlms on ITO/glass, spray-cast ﬁlms (deposited at the long
wave peak to an absorbance of 1.0 ± 0.05) were subjected to
repeated cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycling (25 “break-in”
cycles) to observe any redox and optical changes between the
pristine (as-cast) and broken-in states (post 25 cycles). All
polymer ﬁlms demonstrated reversible break-in cycling with
electrochemical diﬀerences between the ﬁrst and second scan,
stabilizing over subsequent scans, as shown in Figure S3.
The UV−vis spectra of the neutral states for the full family of
polymers (after break-in) are shown in Figure 2 with the full
results given in Table 2. The peaks are normalized to the longer
wavelength D−A band to emphasize the eﬀect on peak position
or relative peak intensity upon variation in monomer ratios.
With a sterically relaxed EBE D−A−D architecture, lower
energy onsets of light absorption were achieved that are ∼0.10
eV less than the previously reported ECP-Black. Slight changes
in the spectra of the polymers during electrochemical break-in
were observed, as shown in Figure S5. The shorter wavelength
peak corresponding to the π-to-π* transition exhibits minimal
change upon break-in, except for an increase in intensity seen
with Pro-Pro/EBE. For the lower energy peak attributed to D−
A CT interactions, however, there is a slight red-shift in both
the λmax and the onset of absorption, allowing absorption of
longer wavelength light and with a minor intensity increase.
The changes between the pristine and broken-in spectra are
likely due to backbone reorganization in the form of
planarization from the added EDOTs ﬂanking the acceptor.
This is supported by the decrease in onset of electrochemical
oxidation shown in CV cycles 1 and 2 in Figure S3, an
observation which has been reported previously in π-
conjugated systems.47
In Figure 2a, as torsional strain is increased from Pro-Pro/
EBE to Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 to Ac-Ac/EBE, the π-to-π* λmax

blue-shifts from 543 to 505 to 457 nm, respectively, with a
window of transmission gradually becoming more pronounced,
until the window is positioned at 558 nm for Ac-Ac/EBE,
leading to a green neutral state. This is eﬀectively one structural
“knob” with which to tune the hue of an ECP. A second “knob”
that tunes saturation is shown in Figure 2b, where the steric
strain is reduced/relaxed with increased EBE content from Pro-
Ac0.75/EBE0.25 to Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30 to Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35. The
λmax for the high-energy π-to-π* peak in this series of polymers
changes little from 505 to 495 to 487 nm, respectively.
Concurrently, the ratio of the absorbance of the two peaks (π-
to-π*/D−A) decreases from 1.44 (for Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25) to
1.18 (for Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30), until becoming nearly equal at
1.04 (for Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35). Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 exhibits dual-
band absorption with a shallow window at 586 nm, making it
nearly achromatic. For all of these polymers, the D−A
absorption peak remains relatively ﬁxed at 671−680 nm.
Spectroelectrochemistry. To examine the changes in
absorption upon redox switching, and detail the electrochromic
contrast from the neutral to the most oxidized states,
spectroelectrochemistry of the polymer thin ﬁlms was
performed in 50 mV steps. The extreme states are presented
in Figure 3 with the full series in Figure S6. The change in
transmittance at the long wavelength peak is scrutinized as
donor−acceptor systems typically exhibit poor transmission
during cycling. In general for this material family, at the long
wavelength peak, the polymers have fully oxidized states with a
change in transmittance (Δ%T) > 50% with the exception of
Ac-Ac/EBE, likely due to strain from the high AcDOT content
preventing enhanced delocalization of the charged states.
However, Ac-Ac/EBE exhibits a Δ%T at the long wavelength
peak of 44%, still greater than the Δ%T of ECP-Black at 634
nm, which is 41%. Ac-Ac/EBE also has a higher contrast when
compared to previously reported green-to-transmissive
ECPs.55−58
In order to compare eﬀects on contrast, the Δ%T for these
broadly absorbing polymers have been quantiﬁed by integrating
the neutral and oxidized state spectra across the visible (380−
780 nm). All the polymers with the exception for Ac-Ac/EBE
have integrated contrast values (Δ%Tint) > 50%. Ac-Ac/EBE
has the lowest integrated contrast due to its high degree of
strain, preventing enhanced delocalization of charged states.
With this, it is evident that the method of using a relaxed D−
A−D system substantially enhances the overall contrast across
the visible relative to ECP-Black, as shown in Table 3. It is
important to note that as the EBE content in Pro-Ac0.75/
EBE0.25, Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30, and Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 is increased,
there is little reduction in contrast with growing content of
EBE. This means that a relaxed D−A−D approach could be
used to tune a myriad of colors based on higher EBE content
with minimal loss to contrast.
Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 has the most even absorption across the
visible, appearing black-brown to the eye when neutral (see
Figure S8). When fully oxidized, it exhibits a higher level of
visible light transmission when compared to ECP-Black. The
full spectroelectrochemical series is shown in Figure 4 where
the general spectral properties and features are the same across
the family of polymers (Figure S6). As the polymers are
progressively oxidized, there is an uneven depletion in the
intensity between the two peaks as demonstrated by the green
spectrum corresponding to 150 mV in Figure 4, where the D−
A CT peak appears to oxidize more rapidly than the π-to-π*
peak. This is likely due to the EDOTs possessing a lower
oxidation potential than other DOTs. This results in the color
values forming a “loop” on colorimetry throughout the
oxidation process (vide infra).
Though this family of materials exhibits an elevated EC
contrast relative to ECP-Black, in the oxidized state there is still
a considerable degree of visible light absorption tailing from
600 to 780 nm when compared to all donor polymers.47 This
tail absorbing red light, highlighted by the shaded triangle in
Figure 4, though reduced in magnitude in this family of
polymers relative to ECP-Black, continues to impart a pale blue
hue to the oxidized states.

Colorimetry. L*a*b* color space results and photos for the
polymers under study are presented in Figures 5 and 6 with
examples as a function of thicknesses found in Figures S7 and
S8. In this color visualization, a* represents green to red, and
b* the blue to yellow, hues (negative to positive values
respectively). L* depicts the lightness: a value of 0 would be
black and 100 would be white. As the magnitudes of a* and b*
increase, color becomes more saturated, and as one traverses
between color points or values, the hue changes. As the ECPs
reported here are broadly absorbing, they have a* and b* values
closer to the origin than those for the more saturated and
vibrantly colored ECPs.
As detailed above, color has been controlled through two
routes to enhance the transmittance of the fully oxidized states.
The ﬁrst route or “knob” to control neutral state color (a*, b*)
is associated with the steric strain of the donors along the main
chain from Pro-Pro/EBE (−31, 30) to Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 (23,
−4) to Ac-Ac/EBE (−14, 44) (shown in Figures 5a and 6).
Pro-Pro/EBE has a broad, but uneven, absorption across the
visible spectrum (Figure 2), allowing unequal amounts of blue
and red light to pass, giving the ﬁlm a deep purple appearance.
Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 absorbs much of the blue and green light
from its short-wavelength π-to-π* peak, while transmitting a
portion of red light, appearing as dark, brick-red in color. Both
of these polymers absorb strongly where the y̅ standard
observer is most stimulated, giving them low L* values.
However, due to their uneven absorption, they possess a degree
of color saturation. Upon electrochemical oxidation, the a*b*
values for the more color-neutral materials change minimally,
while L* changes drastically, indicating an increase in lightness
of the most oxidized transmissive state. Ac-Ac/EBE, with its
highly blue-shifted π-to-π* band, absorbs more blue than red
light; but with a deep window centered at 556 nm, it allows
green light to pass and exhibits a lime-green color with a high
b* value.
Comparing this series, Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25 exhibited a longer
wavelength peak intensity that more closely matched the
absorbance of the shorter wavelength peak, thereby making it
more achromatic or color neutral, while retaining a high EC
contrast across the visible. As such, it was selected as the
starting point to study the eﬀect of increasing the content of the
relaxed D−A−D EBE on color and contrast as the second route
or “knob” to control color (a*, b*). Examining the results of
Figures 5b and 6, as the content of EBE is raised from Pro-
Ac0.75/EBE0.25 (23, −4) to Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30 (13, 0) to Pro-
Ac0.65/EBE0.35 (5, 3), the saturation is progressively reduced
and the colors become more muted. Because of the more even
absorption that is present in these systems across the visible
spectrum (Figure 2), more light is able to overlap with the y̅
standard observer, raising the lightness. Pro-Ac0.70/EBE0.30
absorbs more red light than Pro-Ac0.75/EBE0.25, so color values
decrease overall, making it brown. Subsequently, Pro-Ac0.65/
EBE0.35 absorbs even more red light, reducing the saturation
further to appear black-brown. Though it has low a*, b* values
of 5, 3, the positive magnitude is a result of residual red and

orange light transmitting due to the transmission window at
586 nm. A “loop” (vide supra) can be seen in all of the color
plots in Figure 5a,b or Figure S7 and is a result of the longer
wavelength D−A band bleaching faster upon oxidation than the
π-to-π* band. This allows more red light to reach the eye with
increasing voltage, so the a* becomes more positive and the
polymers pass through reddened intermediate states. Ac-Ac/
EBE, on the other hand, passes through yellow-hued
intermediate states because more red light along with green
light is stimulating both the M and L cones, respectively, which
the brain interprets as yellow.
These new materials are more transmissive than previous D−
A ECPs. Closely examining Figures 5 and 6, can the eye notice
the diﬀerence between color points of the fully oxidized
transmissive states? This is determined by taking a geometric
distance of color points using the equation

where ΔEab* represents the diﬀerence between colors points,
with values below 2.3 (or what the CIE determines as just
noticeable difference (JND)) indicating diﬀerences that are not
noticeable to the eye.59 Comparing the fully oxidized color
states between ECP-Black and Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35, we calculate
a ΔEab* of 4.8, conﬁrming a noticeable diﬀerence, with Pro-
Ac0.65/EBE0.35 having the least color once fully oxidized.
Within this study, the most color neutral polymer developed,
Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35, retains a red-brown hue as a result of the
small disparity in the intensity in absorption between the two
major bands, in combination with an absorption trough
centered at 586 nm. To further reduce color saturation, with
the ultimate goal of forming a true black electrochrome, we
turned our attention to solution coprocessing of an additional
high-contrast ECP, speciﬁcally ProDOT2-EDOT47 with a λmax
at 590 nm, into thin ﬁlms with Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35. This strategy
was used to ﬁll in the gap at the transmission window,
smoothing the spectral proﬁle of the ﬁlms, while retaining a
high EC contrast upon switching.
Coprocessing an 85/15 w/w solution mixture of [Pro-Ac0.65/
EBE0.35]/[ProDOT2-EDOT] by spray-casting into ﬁlms
produces such an absorption with a particularly ﬂat spectral
proﬁle throughout the range of 450−700 nm as shown in
Figure 7 (and supported by overlaid spectra of the two
polymers in Figure S9). While an overall increase in
chromaticity is observed for this mixture, relative to the 80/
20 composition, the most notable change in this is the
production of an aesthetically pleasing indigo-black hue, seen in
the lowering of the b* coordinate from 3 to −7. Additionally,
an improvement to the integrated contrast is observed with this
mixture, from 51.7% in the neat polymer to 53.0% in the blend.
It should be noted that a mild asymmetry is still present in the

spectral proﬁle of the 15% ProDOT2-EDOT mixture. However,
further incorporation of ProDOT2-EDOT by increasing the
content to 20 wt % is not a viable strategy to address this
asymmetry, producing a mixture with higher chromaticity and
an observed contrast lower than that of the neat polymer
(51.3%). In a similar pursuit to better color match for dark-to-
transmissive applications, Sassi et al.60 recently detailed Weitz-
type electrochromes utilizing polymerizable EDOT/ProDOT
side chains which achieved absorption proﬁles, color values, and
impressive contrasts comparable to the materials discussed
herein. A ﬁlm of PB was then added to absorb longer
wavelength light, yielding the desired black state.
■CONCLUSION
Five new broadly absorbing polymers utilizing a relaxed
donor−acceptor−donor architecture (where EDOTs ﬂank
BTD) were synthesized showing improved electrochromic
contrast, where previously reported systems exhibited tailing
absorption of long wavelength light, yielding pale blue oxidized
transmissive state hues. Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35 (and all of the
polymers and mixtures in this study with the exception for Ac-
Ac/EBE) achieved integrated contrast values Δ%Tint > 50%, a
signiﬁcant improvement over previous DOT-based black-to-
transmissive ECPs, making them suitable for potential
application in eyewear and window type devices. To achieve
more aesthetically pleasing indigo-black neutral state hues with
high electrochromic contrast, mixtures of Pro-Ac0.65/EBE0.35
with the all donor polymer ProDOT2-EDOT were produced
(15 and 20 wt % ProDOT2-EDOT) giving black-to-trans-
missive ﬁlms, while maintaining a Δ%Tint > 50%. Though a
persistent absorption tail from 650 to 800 nm remains in these
new polymers, they demonstrate a method to improve overall
contrast across the visible. Thus, the blue hue resulting from
residual absorption due to the acceptor moiety in broadly
absorbing D−A polymers can be mitigated through relaxing the
charged state delocalization (“quinoidization”) by swapping the
donor structure from the seven-member pendant ring ProDOT
(higher steric strain) with six-member ring EDOT (lesser steric
strain).
Ultimately, this study leads us to ask the question, what is
black when one considers varied hues in ECPs? Black neutral state
colors are diﬃcult to achieve as conjugated backbones that can
capture light across the visible spectrum where steric
interactions are used to absorb short and medium wavelength
light while donor−acceptor interactions absorb long wave-
lengths are necessary. More challenging is achieving highly
transmissive oxidized states when the varied steric hindrance
and electron richness, or poorness, along a π system needed to
attain the broad neutral absorption do not easily planarize or
form stabilized oxidized states. From a device practicality
standpoint, what is pleasing to our eye? Would it be better to
use a single material with broad absorption giving L*a*b* color
values as close to zero as possible while sacriﬁcing contrast
given the current state of the art? Should one compromise and
use materials that are brown, deep purple, or burgundy but
possess greater contrast? Or is it better to employ polymers
with chromaticity and higher contrasts and then color match to
achieve desired black hues? As there are considerable challenges
in balancing the steric and electronic eﬀects to achieve black
neutral state colors, while stabilizing charges for highly
transmissive states, these are questions to be considered in
the exploration of new materials or architectures for electro-
chromic devices.
