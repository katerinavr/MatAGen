In order to create multicolour displays using electrochromic (EC)
technologies, the modulation of the intensity of three primary
subtractive colours (red, yellow, blue, or cyan, magenta, yellow)
could be used to express any colour in the spectrum. Herein we
report
the
ﬁrst
cathodically
colouring
yellow-to-transmissive
switching EC polymer, which completes a full colour palette and
promises to fulﬁl the requirements necessary to create multicolour
EC displays.
Non-emissive display technologies utilizing electrochromic (EC)
materials are at the forefront of materials research today. EC devices
have the ability to be viewed in a wide variety of lighting conditions,
and large area devices can be fabricated using convenient and inex-
pensive printing techniques. Importantly, EC displays utilizing
materials that can exhibit three primary colours could be employed to
create full colour displays where the expression of any colour can be
achieved through the control of the intensity of each of the primary
colours. There has been much discussion in the literature on the
additive primary colours red, green, and blue;1–4 however, for displays
which are truly non-emissive, the primary subtractive colours must be
employed to allow any colour to be produced.5 Kobayashi et al. have
elegantly demonstrated this principle with molecular electrochromic
species, but unfortunately the potential at which colouration occurs is
quite high (2 V), and switching occurs in tens of seconds rather than
subsecond speeds necessary for dynamic, yet non-video rate appli-
cations.6
Cathodically colouring EC polymers have demonstrated attractive
properties for display type applications (i.e. fast switching speed, high
contrast), but the lack of cathodically colouring yellow ECPs has
limited production of multicolour display prototypes utilizing these
materials. Polymers with high band gaps between 2.3 and 2.7 eV that
display the colour yellow have not been realized as cathodically
colouring (ECPs), as the high band gap required to achieve the yellow
colour has not allowed shifting of the visible absorption bands into
the NIR on oxidation, prohibiting a transmissive state.7 A few
anodically colouring yellow polymers have been produced,8,9 but in
practice these polymers will be difﬁcult to incorporate into display
devices as application of a narrow potential window is required to
achieve the yellow colour without displaying brownish hues, and long
term stability to more than 500 switches has not been reported. In the
closest example of a cathodically colouring yellow-to-transmissive
EC polymer, our group reported a conjugated oligomer containing
pendant acrylate moieties that was photopatterned using UV medi-
ated polymerisation.10 The material was found to switch from
a yellow neutral state to a dark blue cation-radical state, and ﬁnally
a lighter blue dicationic state, but the strong residual blue colour
could not be overcome. In order to address these problems, here we
demonstrate a simple approach which yields a solution processable
yellow-to-transmissive switching EC polymer.
Dioxythiophenes (DOTs) have long been a monomer of choice in
cathodically colouring ECPs;11,12 however, homopolymers5,13–15 and
donor–acceptor polymers3,4,16–19 incorporating these moieties have
resulted in materials with band gaps that are too low to display the
desired yellow colour. We hypothesized that the alternation of
p-phenylene moieties, with their high aromaticity and subtle steric
repulsion from ortho-C–H units, would shift the band gap of these
polymers higher while still allowing a sufﬁcient amount of electro-
chemical doping to facilitate shifting of absorption from the visible
well into the NIR. To this end, a Suzuki polycondensation was
employed to give the desired alternating ProDOT–phenylene poly-
mer, as shown in Scheme 1. The polymer was endcapped after the
reaction
using
a
phenylboronic
acid
ester,
followed
by
bromobenzene, and was isolated in high yield (83%) with a number
average molecular weight (Mn) of 25 kDa (see the ESI† for GPC and
NMR data).
Thin ﬁlms of the polymer were spray-cast onto indium tin oxide
(ITO) coated glass slides from a 2 mg mL1 toluene solution
and electrochemically cycled from 0.00 V to 1.08 V vs. Fc/Fc+ in a 0.2
M LiBTI (lithium bistriﬂuoromethanesulfonimide)/PC (propylene
carbonate) solution until a stable and reproducible voltammogram
was obtained (see the ESI† for electrochemical data), then subjected
to
spectroelectrochemical
analysis.

spectroelectrochemical response in terms of percent transmittance as
a function of applied potential. As seen in the bold black spectrum,
a sharp absorption band with a lmax at 455 nm is present in the
neutral state, and the onset of absorption reveals a band gap of
around 2.38 eV. Upon oxidation, the intensity of absorption at
455 nm is signiﬁcantly reduced, while a polaronic transition arises
around 650 nm. The intensity of the polaronic transition depletes at
higher oxidation levels, giving way to a strong bipolaronic absorption
extending beyond 1600 nm. Importantly, when fully oxidized the
polymer is greater than 75% transmissive across the entire visible
range (400–750 nm).
In order to evaluate the colours of the polymer ﬁlms as the human
eye perceives them, the L*a*b* values (CIE 1976 L*a*b* Color
Space) for three polymer ﬁlms of differing optical density were
measured as a function of electrochemical doping level, and the a*b*
values for each step (50 mV steps, 180 to 1080 mV vs. Fc/Fc+) are
shown in Fig. 2, and photographs of each ﬁlm in the neutral and fully
oxidized states are inset. The extremely high b* values in the neutral
state indicate that the material is a highly saturated yellow as viewed
by the human eye, as is also evident in the photographs. Surprisingly,
the ﬁlms also displayed slightly negative a* values indicative of
a green hue, which is likely due to yellow-green emission from the
polymer ﬁlms when irradiated with white light (see the ESI†). At
intermediate doping levels, the polaronic transition results in negative
b* values, indicative of a blue colour state. At around 1040 mV, only
slightly negative b* (5 to 10) values remain and the a* values are
near zero (0 to +2), as the ﬁlms are faintly sky blue coloured and
highly transmissive, also shown in the photographs.
Another important parameter that governs an ECPs ability to be
utilized in display-type devices (such as e-readers and signage) is the
speed at which the polymer can be switched from one colour state to
another, as rapidly switching materials are required. Fig. 3 shows the
change in % transmittance at the lmax of a spray-cast ﬁlm of P1, as
a function of time, as potential square waves were applied. As can be
seen in Fig. 3, this ﬁlm exhibits an excellent 73% contrast at 455 nm,
and is also able to retain a high level of that contrast at switching rates
as high as 1 s per potential step, and requires 0.8 s to achieve 95% of
a full switch. Even at a switching rate of 0.5 s per potential, the
polymer still retains 63% contrast.
As mentioned previously, the necessity for a cathodically colouring
yellow-to-transmissive electrochrome is paramount in completing the
colour palette for non-emissive displays using the subtractive colour
mixing theories of CMY and RYB. To demonstrate subtractive
primary colour mixing, we have spray-cast overlaying ﬁlms of yellow
(from this work), red,5 and blue19 ECPs through circular masks
sequentially as shown in Fig. 4a and b.

from a 2 mg mL1 solution in toluene, and electrochemical oxidation
was carried out in 0.2 M lithium bistriﬂuoromethanesulfonimide (LiBTI)/
propylene carbonate (PC) solution, using a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode
(10 mM AgNO3/0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in MeCN, calibrated to the Fc/Fc+
redox couple, EFc/Fc+  EAg/Ag+ ¼ 80 mV) and a Pt wire counter electrode.
The applied potential was increased in 50 mV steps from 180 mV to 1080
mV vs. Fc/Fc+.

As is seen in Fig. 4a and b, for the neutralized state of all three
polymers where the ﬁlms overlap, a subtractive mixture of the
primary colours is created. For example, where yellow and red
overlap, the colour is orange, where red and blue overlap, there is
purple, and where blue and yellow overlap, there is green. In the
center where all of the colours overlap, a black colour appears as is
especially apparent using the thicker ﬁlms shown in Fig. 4a. When
a sufﬁciently positive potential is applied across the electrode, all three
polymers are oxidized to their highly transmissive states shown in the
right photograph in Fig. 4b. This is the ﬁrst demonstration of the
utilization of the subtractive primaries (yellow, red, and blue) of
electrochromic polymers in colour mixing to form additional colours
that all switch to highly transmissive, as needed for full-colour elec-
trochromic displays.
Conclusions
Yellow-to-transmissive electrochromic materials are necessary for the
development of multicolour electrochromic displays which use the
subtractive primaries (red, blue, yellow or cyan, magenta, yellow) to
display any desired colour. We report a new alternating propylene-
dioxythiophene–phenylene copolymer which is the ﬁrst polymer that
is yellow in its neutral state and displays high transmissivity over the
entire visible region in its oxidized state. The polymer achieves over
70% transmittance contrast at the absorption maximum, and attains
95% of a full switch in less than 1 second. We also demonstrate the
importance of this polymer as subtractive colour mixing is used to
show how the expression of three subtractive primary colours could
be used to create displays that can exhibit essentially any colour in the
spectrum. This new material promises to allow development of full
multicolour EC devices.
