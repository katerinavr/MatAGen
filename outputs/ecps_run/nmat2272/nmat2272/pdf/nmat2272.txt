In the context of the fast-growing demand for innovative
high-performance display technologies, the perspective of
manufacturing low-cost functional materials that can be easily
processed over large areas or ﬁnely printed into individual
pixels, while being mechanically deformable, has motivated the
development of novel electronically active organic components
fulﬁlling the requirements for ﬂexible displays and portable
applications. Among all technologies relying on a low-power
stimulated optical change, non-emissive organic electrochromic
devices (ECDs) oﬀer the advantage of being operational under a
wide range of viewing angles and lighting conditions spanning
direct sunlight as desired for various applications including
signage, information tags and electronic paper. Combining
mechanical ﬂexibility, high contrast ratios and fast response
times, along with colour tunability through structural control,
polymeric electrochromes constitute the most attractive organic
electronics for tomorrow’s reﬂective/transmissive ECDs and
displays1–3. Although red, blue4 and most recently green5–10
electrochromic polymers (ECPs) required for additive primary
colour space were investigated, attempts to make saturated
black ECPs have not been reported, probably owing to the
complexity of designing materials absorbing eﬀectively over
the whole visible spectrum. Here, we report on the use of the
donor–acceptor approach to make the ﬁrst neutral-state black
polymeric electrochrome. Processable black-to-transmissive
ECPs promise to aﬀect the development of both reﬂective
and transmissive ECDs by providing lower fabrication and
processing
costs
through
printing,
spraying
and
coating
methods, along with good scalability when compared with their
traditional inorganic counterparts1,11,12.
Deﬁned as an optical change operating in a material on
electron transfer (redox), or by application of an external bias,
the phenomenon of electrochromism was ﬁrst observed by Deb in
the transition-metal oxide WO3 in 1969 (ref. 13). Featuring high
photochemical stability and switching reversibly from a transparent
to an intense blue colour through electrochemically induced
intervalence
charge-transfer
optical
transitions,
cathodically
colouring
WO3
has
become
the
material
of
choice
for
electrochromic windows14,15. Since then, numerous other metal
oxides have been studied in the context of ‘black to colourless’
switching electrochromics including oxides of molybdenum
(MoO3), iridium (Ir(OH)3) and nickel (NiOx) (ref. 12). In addition
to being inherently brittle, metal oxides often exhibit long switching
times of multiple seconds to minutes along with low colouration
eﬃciencies and contrast ratios12. Alternatively, by exhibiting higher
contrasts, a variety of colours and the capability to perform
on ﬂexible substrates, organic electrochromics are now being
applied to numerous applications including smart windows and
mirrors1,16, switchable displays17 and electrochromic inks18,19. In
parallel, they could possibly meet the growing demand for optical
modulators and shutters in message-laser communications and
optical data storage12.
Of the organic electrochromes, electroactive conducting
polymers show relatively facile synthetic access, environmental
stability and solution processability. By controlling the repeat-unit
structure, a range of colours spanning the full visible spectrum
can be attained1. For instance, polyaniline can attain a transmissive
yellow-to-black switch, although it is unstable to repeated
switching20, hence the necessity for new polymer design.
In spite of signiﬁcant eﬀort in the ﬁeld of polymer-based solar
cells towards developing materials absorbing homogeneously over a
broad bandwidth of the ultraviolet–visible spectrum21–29, the ability
to design strongly absorbing electrochromic polymers (ECPs) that
can be switched to a highly transmissive state has remained a
challenge owing to the extra requirement for simultaneous and
eﬃcient electrochemical bleaching of all absorption bands over the
visible region.
In fully π-conjugated organic polymers, as the oxidation level
is progressively increased, charged carriers balanced with counter
ions are created along the backbone that have long-wavelength
optical absorptions. For a suﬃciently low energy-gap polymer, as
oxidative (p-type) doping generates the formation of radical cations
(polarons) and further dications (bipolarons), the absorption can
be transferred into the near-infrared region with depletion of the
ground-state π–π∗transition in the visible region. The ability of
the backbone to assume a stable quinoidal geometry, as well as the
position of the bipolaronic transition relative to the visible region,
governs the transmissivity of the fully oxidized state.
While investigating the use of the donor–acceptor approach
in designing novel donor–acceptor ECPs exhibiting a two-band
absorption in the visible so as to reﬂect and/or transmit
colours commonly diﬃcult to achieve such as saturated greens,
we discovered that low- and high-energy transitions could be
controlled in a substantial and interconnected fashion by varying

the relative contribution of electron-rich and -poor moieties
incorporated in the repeat unit. This structural modiﬁcation
enabled us to balance both short- and long-wavelength absorption
bands as the acceptor core is ﬁrst increasingly substituted with
donor substituents and subsequently polymerized. In addition, a
‘merging’ of the bands is observed that oﬀers the potential for
the synthesis of neutral-state coloured materials possessing either
highly saturated or darker colours. Theoretical work addressing the
relevance of the donor–acceptor approach for designing organic
metals shows that systems involving two or more distinct optical
transitions can be rationalized by considering the presence of
low-lying unoccupied and localized energy levels within the
bandgap of the ground-state conjugated structure30,31.
On the basis of these empirical considerations, a copolymer
possessing an absorption spectrum extended over the entire visible
region (400–700 nm) was synthesized and its redox properties
investigated. We found that the copolymer achieves reversible
electrochromic switching from a strong opaque neutral black to a
highly transmissive oxidized state over a potential window of less
than 1 V, a desirable parameter for low-voltage device applications.
Here, we report on the synthesis and polymerization of
a series of donor–acceptor oligomers diﬀering by the ratio of
electron-rich
to
electron-deﬁcient
substituents
incorporated,
which demonstrates the rationale for ‘merging’ of the short-
and long-wavelength optical transitions; full synthetic details
are reported in the Supplementary Information. The soluble
oligomeric
analogues
M1,
M2
and
M3
were
synthesized
by
symmetrical
and
repeated
substitution
of
the
donor
3,4-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene
(DOT-(OEtHx)2)
onto
the
acceptor
core
2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
(BTD)
(ref.
32);
the
molecular structures of M1, M2 and M3 are shown in Fig. 1a;
absorption spectra are reported in Supplementary Information,
Fig. S1. The oligomers were then subsequently polymerized
aﬀording P1, P2 and P3, the optical properties of which were
investigated as a function of the length of the donor-based
conjugated chromophores (2 m) spacing BTD along the backbones;
the molecular structures of P1, P2 and P3 are shown in
Fig. 1a. As shown in Fig. 1b, diminishing the concentration of
the electron-poor heterocycle along the conjugated backbone
(increasing the length of the oligo-thienylene electron-rich block)
gives a simultaneous bathochromic shift of the high-energy
transition and hypsochromic shift of the low-energy transition
with both peaks tending towards the lmax of the P4 control
homopolymer, resulting in the ‘merging’ of the two transitions.
At the same time, the relative intensities of the low- and
high-energy peaks evolve towards balancing each other. Hence,
P3 exhibits a broad absorption spectrum almost entirely covering
the visible region with the exception of a dark-red portion
between 625 and 700 nm and the blue–green gap located
at 450–550 nm; the colours of P1 to P4 in toluene solution
are shown in Fig. 1c. We attribute the dark wine hue of P3
to its overall high visible absorbance with minimal red-light
transmission. This observation led us to replace the DOT
moiety with the strongly donating 2-ethylhexyloxy-substituted
3,4-propylenedioxythiophene
(ProDOT-(CH2OEtHx)2),
which
possesses a higher highest occupied molecular orbital and should
substantially narrow the bandgap of its subsequent polymer
without the need to exchange BTD for a stronger acceptor; the
molecular structures of M5, M6, M7, P5, P6 and P7 are shown
in Fig. 2a; absorption spectra of the oligomers are reported in
Supplementary Information, Fig. S2.
Figure 2b shows that similar absorption changes and ‘merging’
of both optical transitions take place on increasing the length of
the oligo-ProDOT electron-rich block. In particular, the polymers
are now all strongly absorbing at 650 nm, thus covering the targeted
red portion of the visible region. In the case of P7, the higher energy
transition undergoes a more extensive redshift than the DOT-based
P3, thus opening a blue transmission in the 400–450 nm region and
does not balance the lowest energy transition as eﬀectively as in P3;
the hues of P5, P6 and P7 in toluene solution are shown in Fig. 2c.
As a method to overcome the persistent lack of coverage in the
blue and green regions of the visible region, we reasoned that by
copolymerizing M5 and M8 (monomer of the subsequent control
polymer P8) in a random fashion but in an appropriate feed ratio,
the resulting hybrid would exhibit the extensive absorption from

conﬁrmed by NMR and elemental analysis; see Supplementary
Information, Table S1. A number-average molecular weight of
13.6 kDa and a polydispersity of 2 were estimated by gel permeation
chromatography; see Supplementary Information, Table S1. In
toluene solution, P9 exhibits an intense ink-like dark-blue colour
and shows no signiﬁcant optical change on increase of the
temperature between room temperature and 100 ◦C, indicating
neither major aggregation of the backbone, nor disruption of
eﬀective conjugation.
A ﬁlm of P9 (absorption maximum = 1.13 a.u.) was spray-cast
onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass at room temperature
from toluene (4 mg ml−1), and redox cycled until a stable and
reproducible electrochromic switch was reached. Electrochemical
oxidation of the ﬁlm was carried out in 0.1 M LiBF4/propylene
carbonate
supporting
electrolyte
using
a
silver
wire
as
a
quasi-reference electrode (calibrated against Fc/Fc+) and a
platinum wire as the counter electrode. As shown in Fig. 3b,
when the potential applied to the ﬁlm is increased from −0.09 V,
simultaneous bleaching of the full set of visible absorption bands
is observed. This onset of oxidation is consistent with the low
value estimated at −0.08 V through cyclic and diﬀerential-pulse
voltammetry; see Supplementary Information, Figs S3, S4. As the
visible absorption bands are depleted, polaronic and bipolaronic
transitions progressively arise in the near-infrared region as
expected for a coloured-to-transmissive ECP. Determined from
the onset of absorption of the solid thin ﬁlm, the bandgap of
the polymer was estimated at 1.64 eV. Considering the absorption
maximum at 592 nm as a reference, a transmittance change of
51.5% is measured on electro-oxidation, indicative of the high
degree of electrochromic contrast observed. As shown in Fig. 3c, the
spray-deposited thin ﬁlm of P9 (absorption maximum=1.13 a.u.)
is deep black in its neutral state and attains a remarkably high level
of transparency to the human eye when fully doped; outstanding
stability on long-term switching (10,000 cycles) is reported in
Supplementary Information, Fig. S5.
Considering
this
transparency,
the
colourimetrically
determined relative luminance change of P9, estimating the
brightness of the transmitted light as a percentage of the brightness
of the light source calibrated to the sensitivity of the human
eye, was measured as a function of ﬁlm thickness (absorption
maximum = 1.05, 1.13 and 2.59 a.u.) and doping level induced
by electrochemical oxidation, as shown in Fig. 4a. The polymer
exhibits an excellent relative luminance change varying from
52% for the thinnest to 40% for the thickest deposited ﬁlm,
indicating how these values can be modulated and optimized as
a function of thickness as desired for a speciﬁc application (high
colour density versus high transparency). P9 completes its full
switch in a potential window of less than 0.8 V and exhibits L∗
values (ranging from 0 to 100) in the range 72–85 on oxidation,
demonstrative of its aptitude to nearly reach the ‘white point’
of colour space33. Although the residual blue hue of the neutral
state characterized by the negative b∗values also reported in
Fig. 4a is not readily perceived by the human eye at the considered
ﬁlm thicknesses, we are currently optimizing the choice of the
monomers, the feed ratios to be used in the copolymerizations
as well as investigating well-deﬁned analogues that enable us to
prepare an even more fully black ECP. The response time of the
same broadly absorbing polymer P9 sprayed onto ITO (absorption
maximum estimated at 0.9 a.u.) was characterized throughout a
series of square-wave potential stepping electrochromic switching
experiments in a LiBF4/propylene carbonate solution electrolyte
as described in Fig. 4b. By monitoring the transmittance of the
spray-cast ﬁlm as a function of time at both the shorter (428 nm)
and longer (636 nm) wavelength absorption maxima for potential

as high as 35% (428 nm) and 40% (636 nm) were observed.
Although a variation of electrochromic contrast of about 9%
was observed as the switch time was progressively decreased to
1.5 s, it is likely that subsecond switching times will be attained
on optimization of the switching conditions (nature of the
electrochemical device, identity and size of the ionic species
constituting the electrolyte, quality/thickness of the spray-cast ﬁlm
and so on).
Starting with the donor–acceptor theory introduced in 1993
by Havinga et al.34, our simple approach towards making easily
oxidized conjugated polymers with broad and homogeneous
absorption bandwidths extending over the entire visible spectrum
that can be fully bleached has implications that span numerous
applications including electrochromic windows and displays. The
solution processability of all of the polymers prepared is important
when considering ultimate use relative to the often studied
electropolymerized systems35. Finally, the ‘band-merging’ eﬀect
outlined above aﬀects other potential uses, such as the development
of solution-processable and narrow-bandgap precursors absorbing
throughout the visible region and into the near-infrared region for
organic polymer solar cells36,37.
