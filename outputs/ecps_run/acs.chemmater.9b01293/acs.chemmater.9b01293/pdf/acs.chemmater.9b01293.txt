ABSTRACT: A series of conjugated, random terpolymers based on
all donor repeat units are prepared via direct (hetero)arylation
polymerization yielding cathodically colored electrochromic poly-
mers that span the visible spectrum. The polymers are based on
repeat units of a dialkylthiophene, a 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene,
and dimers of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. Using a tight feedback
loop between computational and experimental chemistry, the colors
of these polymers are controllably tuned to cover the visible
spectrum by controlling the monomer ratios. Examinations via
ultraviolet−visible−near-infrared spectroscopy, diﬀerential pulse
voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry, and colorimetry show that,
while these systems can vary greatly in their spectral properties, their
oxidation potentials are all low (<0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl). The color
tunability allows for access to neutral state orange, red, pink, magenta, purple, and blue polymers of various hues with a* values
ranging from 22 to 35 and b* values ranging from −44 to 45, while maintaining highly transmissive oxidized states. This
approach allows access to a wide gamut of colors with only three monomers while aﬀording materials with low oxidation
potentials and high contrast.
■INTRODUCTION
The history of research of fully conjugated cathodically colored
electrochromic polymers (ECPs) has yielded materials that
span the entire color palette.1−7 These polymers can be spray
cast to form vividly colored ﬁlms that upon oxidation become
highly transmissive in the visible region. Methods of creating
the wide range of possible colors involve incorporating
numerous monomers in well-deﬁned sequences. Random
copolymerization has been used in many approaches as a
means of accessing neutral colors such as brown and black in
electrochromic polymers.8−12 With random copolymerization
broad, low-energy (long wavelength) absorbances are often
achieved by incorporating an electron-accepting moiety in the
polymer backbone. The drawback of donor−acceptor systems
is that they tend to have higher oxidation potentials caused by
the accepting moiety, which limits optical memory (i.e.,
bistability) in the oxidized form, thus making their usefulness
in devices limited. A new approach that circumvents the
challenges caused by incorporating electron acceptors into the
main chain is developed in this work. When considering how
to make color tunable systems without acceptors, it is
important to understand the design of materials for speciﬁc
regions of the color space (Figure 1a). All donor systems can
cover three of the four regions shown here (wide, mid, and low
gap), as green materials, having a highly negative b*, require
dual absorption. The current state of the art all donor polymers
were examined to develop an approach to make a color tunable
system (Figure 1b).
Yellow ECPs, which utilize 1,4-phenylene linkages, have
historically suﬀered from high oxidation potentials and low
redox stability over 100 switches, which is attributed to the
open sites on the aryl ring leaving the materials susceptible to
nucleophilic attack or radical−radical coupling.13,14 The
incorporation of a dialkylthiophene (DAT) as a monomer of
high redox stability in wide-gap electrochromic polymers has
helped to overcome this challenge.15 For absorbing the middle
of the spectrum, the homopolymer of 3,4-propylenedioxythio-
pohene (ProDOT) with 2-ethyl-hexyloxy side chains oﬀers a
high solubility and a low oxidation potential for switching as

well as a high contrast.16 This purple polymer also shows
exemplary contrast, redox stability, and switching speed. For
narrow-gap polymers, typically donor−acceptor systems are
used. The drawbacks to these systems, as previously discussed,
have been circumvented with the advent of a soluble poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) analogue that covers the
narrow-gap portion of the visible spectrum.17 In this polymer,
the biEDOT portion of the polymer brings electron richness
and planarity, narrowing the optical gap and covering the low-
energy portion of the visible region.
In this work, the combination of DAT, ProDOT, and
biEDOT into random copolymers has been demonstrated to
give broadly tunable electrochromic materials that span the
visible spectrum (Figure 2). Using a tight feedback loop
between theory and experiment, the ratios of these monomers
are demonstrated to tune the absorbance of the resulting
polymer, thus giving access to a wide range of colors in their
neutral forms, while all being easily oxidized to highly
transmissive states. Utilizing only these three monomers in
diﬀerent ratios provides access to polymers that are orange,
red, pink, magenta, purple, and blue, all of which can be
oxidized to a highly transmissive form. Relative to the 1:1:1
ratio, an increased DAT content blue-shifts the absorbance of
the polymer and an increased biEDOT content red-shifts the
absorbance, while ProDOT brings a high solubility and a low
oxidation potential. As detailed in Figure 2, the nomenclature
of the polymers discussed in this work will be determined by
the ratio of the monomers in the polymerization reaction. For
example, a random copolymerization that is two parts DAT (x)
and one part each ProDOT (y) and biEDOT (z) is xyz211.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Quantum Chemical Calculations. To elucidate the
impact on the number and identity of aryl ring incorporation
on the color of these systems, density functional theory (DFT)
is utilized. We have found that pairing the mPW1PBE
functional with the cc-PVDZ basis set, while including
dichloromethane through the conductor polarizable calculation
model (CPCM), provides excellent correlation to experimental
data.18−21 A set of multiheterocycle oligomers is chosen to

model possible random copolymers with varying degrees of
conjugation and ring strain and to assess their inﬂuence on the
predicted color (a complete list of the structures studied is
given in Figure S1, and their calculated frontier molecular
orbitals are provided in Figure S2). For each system, the
neutral geometry is optimized followed by a frequency
calculation to ensure the most stable conﬁguration is produced.
Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calcu-
lations were then applied to these structures to simulate the
ultraviolet−visible (UV−vis) spectra and predict the color of
these oligomers.
An examination of the calculated HOMO−LUMO gaps
provides direction with respect to the potential spectral breath,
and the absorption tunability limits, which may be attained by
the copolymers. As the strain along the backbone is increased
by adding DAT units, the HOMO−LUMO gap is widened.
Oligomers possessing the most DAT are particularly
inﬂuenced by distortion from planarity causing a gap increase.
The most twisted species (those that most deviate from the
deﬁned 180° antiplanar geometry) are DPPD, DPDP, DEED,
and DPDPDP with values as low as 128.3°, 156.9°, 136.9°, and
46.8° and ﬁrst excited state gaps of 3.09, 2.98, 2.72, and 2.53
eV, respectively (see Table 1). DPDPDP is the only 6-aryl
group oligomer to be greatly impacted by inclusion of DAT as
compared to PDEEDP, which possesses a ﬁrst excited state gap
that is nearly 0.2 eV smaller. The remaining oligomers
demonstrate that, as the conjugation is extended, the ﬁrst
excited state gap is reduced as seen in EEPPEE and PEEPEE.
The calculated UV−vis spectra of these systems provide
visible peak maxima that vary from 401 to 560 nm, spanning a
diﬀerence of nearly 160 nm. Of the 15 generated excited states,
only three or four possess oscillator strengths of ≥0.1 (see
Table S1). This observation shows that the absorptions are
dominated by a small number of optical transitions of
signiﬁcance. Aside from the locations of the peak maxima,
there are no diﬀerences in the predicted peak shapes in the
visible range as shown in Figure 3 (for more detailed
comparisons, see Figures S3 and S4). In fact, members of
the set of oligomers possessing ﬁve aryl groups produce nearly
identical spectra and have peak maxima that diﬀer by only 24
nm. The four- and six-aryl group structures are more impacted
by torsion along the backbone and have ranges of 72 and 70
nm, respectively.
The simulated UV−vis spectra of these molecules also
provide a means of estimating the color that may be produced
in the CIE L*a*b* color space.22−24 Positive a* and b* values
represent red and yellow, respectively, while the negative
values indicate blue and green, respectively. As the magnitudes
of a* and b* increase, the color becomes more saturated, and
as one traverses between color points, the hue changes. L*
depicts the lightness: a value of 0 would be black, and a value

of 100 would be white. The L*, a*, and b* coordinates are
translated to the RGB color space to display the predicted
color of the oligomers (both sets of coordinates are listed in
Table S2) and are indicated in Figure 4 along with their
corresponding HOMO, LUMO, and ﬁrst excited state gap
values. The predicted colors give a range of the color space that
could be reached experimentally and show that these
monomers have the potential to cover wide-gap, midgap, and
narrow-gap absorptions.
Polymer Synthesis and Characterization. The ap-
proach to the polymer syntheses is shown in Scheme 1. The
polymers were prepared via direct (hetero)arylation polymer-
ization where the ratios of the monomers allow for tuning the
color. The stoichiometry is balanced by using the proper
proportions of ProDOT and ProDOT-Br2 such that the aryl
bond carbon−bromide:carbon−hydrogen ratio is equal to 1.
The polymerizations were carried out under an argon
atmosphere over 24 h followed by precipitation into methanol,
followed by puriﬁcation via Soxhlet extraction, during which
they were washed with methanol, acetone, hexanes, and
chloroform. The chloroform fraction was retained and
underwent palladium and potassium scavenging before being
reprecipitated, ﬁltered, and dried to aﬀord the desired product.
Polymerization yields were all ≥67%, and GPC-estimated
molecular weights were all ≥10 kDa, relative to a polystyrene
standard. These molecular weights show that the polymers are
above the eﬀective conjugation length and would not undergo
a change in color if they were longer. Polymerization yields and
GPC-estimated molecular weights are collated in Table 2, and
all GPC traces are shown in Figure S5. As one can see by the
elemental analysis results, the polymers tend to have high
sulfur percentages and low carbon and hydrogen percentages.

This is indicative of incorporation of more biEDOT into the
structure compared to what the monomer feed ratio would
suggest. This is can be explained by the relative reactivity and
solubility of the monomers. DAT is less reactive and is
incorporated into the copolymer at a rate slower than that of
biEDOT, so there is signiﬁcant copolymer drift early in the
polymerization. As more biEDOT is added to the polymer, the
polymer becomes less soluble due to the lack of side chains
present in the monomer. This leads to polymers with the most
biEDOT to precipitate from the polymerization and thus
incorporate less DAT and ProDOT into the structure.
Synthetic procedures, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra,
and elemental analyses are also given in the Supporting
Information. All polymers are soluble in CHCl3 upward of 5
mg/mL allowing for airbrush spray processing and drop
casting for ﬁlm formation.
Electrochemical and Optical Properties. For electro-
chemical characterization, polymer ﬁlms are drop cast onto Pt
button electrodes from 2 mg/mL solutions (3 μL) in CHCl3 to
cover the electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and diﬀerential
pulse voltammetry (DPV) were performed on ﬁlms of the
polymers to gain insight into how the diﬀerent comonomers
aﬀected the electrochemical properties of the resulting
polymers. Representative CV and DPV data are provided in
Figure 5 for xyz211 and xyz112. Upon examination of the
electrochemical oxidation of the materials via DPV, the onset
of oxidation follows the expected trend of polymers containing
more DAT having higher oxidation potentials (CV and DPV
data for polymers can be found in Figure S6). As monomer
ratios are tuned, the resultant onsets of oxidation (Eox), as
determined by DPV, range from −81 to 476 mV relative to
Ag/AgCl giving a large window for tuning the desired
electrochemical switching potential (Eox values are listed in
Table 3).
The Eox for xyz111 was found at 141 mV, and as more DAT
is added to the polymer structure, the Eox increases. xyz221 has
an Eox of 444 mV, and the highest Eox was found for xyz211
(476 mV). This observation is due to DAT being the least
electron rich of the monomers and also providing the most
interring strain. More interring strain causes a higher energy
barrier to planarize the conjugated backbone upon oxidation.
Conversely, biEDOT provides more planarity and electron
richness to the polymer compared to DAT; thus, increasing the
ratio of biEDOT in the structure lowers the oxidation
potential. This is seen in xyz122 having an Eox of −46 mV
and xyz112 being the polymer with the lowest Eox (−81 mV).
For optical characterization, polymer ﬁlms were airbrush
sprayed onto glass/ITO electrodes from 3 mg/mL solutions in
1:1 toluene/chloroform mixtures. All of the polymers form
smooth ﬁlms with little scattering. Films are sprayed to an
absorbance of 1.00 ± 0.05 in the as-cast state. UV−vis spectra
are measured in a 0.5 M TBAPF6/PC electrolyte solution after
10 CV cycles, as the polymers swell with electrolyte upon
oxidation and their absorbance intensities and λmax may
change. Upon electrochemical conditioning of electrochromic
polymers in general, the UV−vis absorption typically exhibits a
characteristic red-shift of the absorbance as the polymer’s
conjugation in the charge neutral state is extended compared
to that of the as-cast ﬁlm. Absorbance values are normalized
due to the increase or decrease in absorbance upon redox
cycling. Figure 6 shows the UV−vis spectra of the ﬁlms of the
polymers after break-in. These polymers’ absorptions show a
range of λmax from 458 to 586 nm and optical gaps (Eg) from
1.70 to 2.04 eV, which covers a large portion of the visible
spectrum.
Using xyz111 as a reference point for each case, the λmax is
539 nm and the Eg is 1.82 eV. It is evident that the amount of
DAT in the polymer has a profound eﬀect on both the λmax and
the Eg, as evidenced in Figure 6a. This monomer causes the
most interring strain, so for every DAT inserted into the
backbone there is a point of torsion that decreases π−π overlap
between rings, decreasing the eﬀective conjugation length and

widening the optical gap. With xyz211 having the highest ratio
of DAT, it has the highest energy and broadest absorption with
the λmax at 458 nm and an Eg of 2.04 eV. As the DAT content is
reduced compared to that of xyz111, there is a red-shifting in
the λmax to 568 nm and a narrowing of the peak to give an Eg of
1.75 eV for xyz122.
The ratio of biEDOT has an analogous, but opposite, trend
compared to that observed for DAT (Figure 6c). As the
biEDOT ratio is increased, there is a red-shifting of the λmax to
495, 539, and 586 nm for xyz221, xyz111, and xyz112,
respectively. The Eg as a function of biEDOT content also
shows an analogous and opposite trend compared to that of
DAT, where there is a decrease in Eg as the biEDOT ratio is
increased from 1.88 eV for xyz221 to 1.70 eV for xyz112.
The ProDOT content has the smallest eﬀect on controlling
the absorption (Figure 6b), which is expected because its
contribution to visible light absorption lies between those of
the other monomers in terms of electron richness and interring
planarity. As the ProDOT ratio is increased, there is a red-
shifting of the λmax to 512, 539, 550, and 553 nm for xyz212,
xyz111, xyz121, and xyz131, respectively. The high-energy
absorption of xyz212 is likely due to the high content of DAT,
and as the ProDOT content is further increased, there is a
smaller red-shifting eﬀect, such as the small 3 nm shift between
xyz121 and xyz131. A similar trend is also seen when
examining the Eg as a function of ProDOT content. As the
amount of ProDOT is increased, there is a small range in the
Eg from 1.83 eV for xyz212 to 1.77 eV for xyz131. By this
point, the optical properties of the polymer are dominated by
the ProDOT repeat units.
Color and Switching Properties. Spectroelectrochemical
measurements were performed on polymer ﬁlms sprayed on
ITO glass in 0.5 M TBAPF6/PC with a platinum counter
electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Representative
results for xyz211 and xyz112 are detailed in Figure 7 along
with photographs of the ﬁlms held at potential extremes
dictated by the CV results (spectroelectrochemistry results for
all polymers are shown in Figures S7 and S8). In these
experiments, a three-electrode cell is set up in a cuvette where
the polymer ﬁlm cast on ITO acts as the working electrode.
The UV−vis spectrum is then monitored as a function of the
potential applied to the ﬁlm. As one can see in the ﬁgure, the
neutral state absorption in the visible region is depleted upon
oxidation, and there is an increase in the charged state
absorption in the near infrared. After complete oxidation, all of
the polymers show high transmissivity across the visible range.
This transition between colored and transmissive can also be
observed in the photography. A chronoabsorptometry experi-
ment was carried out to show the contrast of the polymers as a
function of switching speed and repeated switching (Figures S9
and S10). In this experiment, the transmittance at λmax is
monitored as the ﬁlms are oxidized and reduced at varying

frequencies. This experiment demonstrates that these polymers
can undergo repeated switching while maintaining their optical
contrast.
In this work, the color is quantiﬁed using the L*a*b* color
space. Colorimetry is used to demonstrate the control over
color with this material design approach. The a*b* color space
results for the polymer ﬁlms are presented graphically in Figure
8 with the L*a*b* values listed in Table 4. In this ﬁgure, the
polymer neutral states are circled and lines are used to guide
the eye between the 100 mV spaced measurement points.
Neutral state colorimetry values are provided as stars for the
homopolymer PProDOT and two alternating polymers PDAT-
ProDOT and PProDOT-biEDOT in Figure 8 for comparison.
It is apparent that all of these new random copolymers are less
saturated than the polymers with the more regular repeat units,
as they are broader in absorbance. In the neutral state, after a
redox switching equilibration, the polymers had L* values
ranging from 32 to 66, a* values ranging from 22 to 35, and b*
values ranging from −44 to 45, thus traversing the wide-gap,
midgap, and low-gap color spaces mentioned in Figure 1a. In
the oxidized states, the polymers exhibited high L* values
ranging from 86 to 91 coupled with low a* values ranging from
−3 to −1 and b* values ranging from −7 to −4, thus giving
forms that are both highly transmissive and color neutral.
Taking a closer look at the “hurricane-like” tracking analysis
for all of the polymer ﬁlms, we ﬁnd an observed initial increase
in b* as the ﬁlm begins to be oxidized. As the polymers are
random in repeat pattern, the individual chromophores along
the chain will have varying oxidation potentials, where those
with the lowest oxidation potential contain the most DOT and
least DAT and would, therefore, have the most red-shifted
(blue light transmitting) absorptions. As the polymer is
oxidized, these chromophores are oxidized ﬁrst, leaving the
highest oxidation potential and widest-gap chromophores,
consisting of the portions with the most DAT incorporated
into the chain, in their neutral form. The polymers with the
most DOT in their structure have more gradual increases in b*
as they begin to oxidize, while the polymers with the least
DOT have small sharp jumps in b* at the beginning of
oxidation.
Upon examination of the breadth of the color space that can
be obtained through this approach, the most logical reference
point is the polymer containing equal parts of each monomer.
The neutral state for xyz111 has a* and b* values of 33 and
−16, respectively, which is observed as a purple-pink color in
the photography. As more ProDOT is added to the structure,
there is a decrease in the a* and b* values for xyz121 (30 and
−24, respectively), which continues to xyz131 (25 and 26,
respectively). This shift in values is indicative of a stronger blue
hue, and a decrease in the red hue of the ﬁlm, which is
observed in the photography as the ﬁlms appearing less pink
and more purple relative to xyz111. As more biEDOT is added
to the polymer structures, there is less interring strain, further
red-shifting absorbance, and more blue light is transmitted. For
xyz122 (23 and −33, respectively) and xyz112 (22 and −44,
respectively), there is a large decrease in b* values leading to
very blue-colored ﬁlms seen in the photography. Similar to the
electrochemistry, the incorporation of DAT has the largest
eﬀect on the colorimetry. As more DAT is added to the
structure, there is more interring strain, further blue-shifting
absorbance, and more red light is transmitted. This causes an
increase in the b* value, indicating that the color is becoming
less blue. The colorimetry values for xyz212 (35 and 2,
respectively) are near the positive a* axis, observed as a red
color in the photography. Replacing the biEDOT with the
slightly more strained ProDOT in xyz221 (34 and 16,
respectively) leads to an increase in a* values leading to
light red ﬁlm. For xyz211 (23 and 45, respectively), there is a
large increase in a* values, as the polymer structure is
dominated by the high-strain monomer, leading to an orange
ﬁlm. With this, it is evident that a broad portion of color space,
from the low-gap region through the midgap region and into
the high-gap region, can be accessed with three simple repeat
units randomly distributed along the chain.
Color Mixing. To demonstrate how we can expand the
spectral and color range accessible by these ECPs, two of these
polymers were combined in diﬀerent ratios to create broadly
absorbing blends (Figure 9). In this experiment, solution
mixtures of xyz211 and xyz112 at 3 mg/mL were mixed in
ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 and ﬁlms were cast via airbrush spraying.

The spectroelectrochemical and photographic results show the
potential for solution phase color mixing of these polymers,
similar to inks, to create ﬁlms of low color saturation, which are
of interest for eyewear and tinting applications.25,26 The
limitations of this all donor approach to creating black-to-clear
switching electrochromics are evident in Figure 9a. This 1:1
mixture of polymers gives a conformal absorption between
∼450 and ∼650 nm, but some red and blue light transmit at
the peripheries of the visible range causing the material to
appear purple. Without the donor−acceptor interaction that is
commonly used to synthesize low-gap conjugated polymers
that can absorb well into the near-infrared region, a full
absorption across the visible spectrum is not feasible. In
general, randomly distributed chromophore black and brown
ECPs containing donor−acceptor moieties also provide a
challenge where the portion of the chain with the largest donor
content bleaches well before the other portions, leaving a green
intermediate state that is not desirable for eyewear and tinting
applications.
As shown in Figure 9b, the 2:1 ratio of xyz211 and xyz112
aﬀords an aesthetically pleasing orange/brown-to-transmissive
switching blend, albeit with a golden intermediate color, prior
to the transition to the light blue transmissive form.
Considering eyewear and tinting applications of electro-
chromism, complex colors that include browns and various
shades of red that can be attained through the mixing process
are desirable.
■CONCLUSION
Electrochromism is a ﬁeld where small changes in color can
have large ramiﬁcations on the applicability of the material into
devices. In this work, a tight feedback loop of calculations and
experiments guided the design of randomly structured
electrochromic polymers with internal chromophores that
cover most of the visible spectrum with only three monomer
repeat units. TDDFT was used to predict the spectral breadth
that could be attained with these systems and guided the
synthesis. The synthesized materials allowed for a large portion
of the low-, mid-, and high-gap color space to be covered while
maintaining low oxidation potentials, high contrast, and long-
lasting optical memory. These properties allow the materials to
function with a low level of power consumption as desired for
systems with portable (e.g., battery) power supplies. Their
mixture and subsequent processing into broadly absorbing
blends have potential in applications where muted and
secondary colors are beneﬁcial.
