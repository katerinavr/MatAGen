ABSTRACT: As the color palette of available solution processable electrochromic polymers expands, there
has remained the need for red, orange, and yellow to transmissive switching materials. Here we report on
the synthesis and characterization of two such polymers, the orange to transmissive switching (poly{3,4-
di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene}) electrochromic polymer-orange (ECP-orange) and the red to transmissive
switching processable polymer (poly{3,4-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene-co-3,4-di(methoxy)thiophene}) elec-
trochromic polymer-red (ECP-red). The ECP-orange has a bandgap of 2.04 eV, an absorption λmax centered
at 483 nm, and an E1/2 of 0.37 V versus Ag/Agþ. The electrochromic contrast is 48% T at 483 nm with a time to
reach 95% of the full optical contrast of 5.3 s for a film that has an absorbance of 0.98 au at λmax. Because of
steric relaxations from the random copolymerization of a branched dialkoxy-substituted thiophene with a
dimethoxy-substituted thiophene, the red to transmissive switching ECP-red has a bandgap of 2.00 eV, a λmax
red-shifted by 42 to 525 nm, and an E1/2 decreased to 0.21 V versus Ag/Agþ. Additionally, the red polymer has
a higher contrast of 60% T and a shorter time to reach 95% of the full optical contrast of 2.3 s. These two
reported polymers allow the field of electrochromics to come closer to a full set of fully solution processable
materials that yield films whose optical absorption covers the full visible spectrum while switching to a highly
transmissive oxidized state as needed for full color displays.
Introduction
Electrochromic materials have held the attention of the scien-
tific community, namely, in the smart windows and dynamic
displays areas, for several decades now.1-7 The most commonly
cited materials are those that include the metal oxides (e.g.,
tungsten trioxide, WO3) and viologen compounds (e.g., 4,40-
dimethylviologen) but also include transition metal complexes
and conjugated electroactive polymers.1,2,8 Whereas many of the
known electrochromic materials have received extensive research
efforts and attempts toward commercialization (some quite
successfully), there remain drawbacks. These include electro-
chromes that are solution-based, limiting application in devices,
such as some viologens, and transition-metal complexes (e.g.,
Ru(bpy)3
2þ), whereas other materials have relatively slow switch-
ing speeds, as with the metal oxides that require anywhere from
30 s to several minutes to reach a full contrast,9 limiting their
application in devices that require a color change at shorter time
frames. Other drawbacks include lack of ease of processability to
high surface area or patterned films (as needed for windows and
displays) and limit in range of colors available. Through intensive
synthetic efforts over the past 5-10 years, conjugated electro-
active polymers have come to address and remedy many of these
drawbacks, with efforts still underway, to allow for fully solution
processable, fast, and stable switching thinfilms thatare available
in colors that span the entire visible region, switching to highly
transmissive states.8,10
There are a large number of examples of polymers with neutral
state absorbances that vary across the visible region such as with
the highly color-tunable azomethines of the Skene group,11-13
and the multiply colored bis-heterocycle arylene polymers of this
group.14-17 Additionally, polymers have been reported with
neutral state absorbances ranging from the UV for N-substituted
poly(3,4-propylenedioxypyrroles)18 to the near-infrared (NIR)
for the low-gap polymers such as the donor-acceptor systems
based on dithienopyrrole,19,20 with colors in between that range
from orange (e.g., bis(thienyl pyrrole)-9H-carbazole from Icli),21
to red (e.g., poly(3-methylthiophene)), blue (e.g., poly(3,4-ethyl-
enedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)),22 and green (e.g., poly(2,7-car-
bazole) derivatives from the Leclerc group),23 and poly(bis-
EDOT-pyridines) of this group.24
However, forfullcolordisplays and window-typeapplications,
it is required that the materials switch between colored and
noncolored highly transmissive states, of which a limited sam-
pling of electrochromic systems is available. Of the systems that
are available, one of the most well-known and well-utilized
colored to transmissive-switching electroactive polymers is
PEDOT.22,25 This polymer can be formed by electropolymeriza-
tion from the monomer to deposit uniform films that switch from
dark blue in the neutral state to highly transmissive, light blue in
the oxidized state. Other colored to transmissive-switching poly-
mers include the alkylenedioxypyrroles, such as poly(3,4-ethyl-
enedioxypyrrole) (PEDOP), which is red in the neutral state and
poly(3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole) (PProDOP), which is orange in
the neutral state, with both switching to transmissive in the
oxidized state.18
Whereas these materials switch effectively from vibrant
colored states to highly transmissive oxidized states, a lack of
solution processabilitylimits their application in many respects as
depositing homogeneous films across large area electrodes is

difficult and costly by electropolymerization. For ultimate ease of
processing and device fabrication, soluble polymers that can be
cast as uniform films are desired. Recent examples of solution
processable colored to transmissive switching polymers include
the alkyl- and alkoxy-substituted propylenedioxythiophenes
(PProDOTs) from our group,26,27 and the donor-acceptor
systems such as the green to transmissive polymers from
Toppare28,29 and our group.30,31
In addition to the purple to transmissive switching PPro-
DOT homopolymers and the green to transmissive ProDOT-
benzothiadiazole-based donor-acceptor-donor polymers men-
tioned, our group has also focused attention on the synthesis of
other fully solution processable multicolored electrochromic
polymers (ECPs) that switch to highly transmissive, as illus-
trated by the a*b* color representation in Figure 1. This set of
ECPs has been named as the family of SprayDOT ECPs.32
Whereas we have been successful in obtaining colors that include
purple,26,27,33 blue,34 turquoise,30,31 green,30,31 and even black,35
it is noted thatuntil now the top half of this color representation is
empty.
One reason for a lack of shorter wavelength absorbing mate-
rials (those which are red, orange, and yellow) that switch to
transmissive is that while the absorbance shifts to longer wave-
lengths on oxidation of these polymers, it is still present in the
visible region as with poly(3-methylthiophene), hence the large
number of ECPs that have neutral state absorbances localized to
wavelengths longer than 550 nm giving them a blue or purple
color. To allow efficient depletion of the visible region absor-
bance on oxidation the electronic transitions must then occur
largely in the NIR, as occurs with PEDOT and ECP-purple, for
example. To allow completion of the full color palette of solu-
tion processable, colored to transmissive materials, judicious
selection and tailoring of the polymer backbone is required such
that the polymer exhibits higher energy absorbances at wave-
lengths shorter than 500 nm, but the charge carriers (polarons
and bipolarons) become highly delocalized as the polymer con-
formation planarizes, shifting the absorbances out of the visible
region.
Here we report the synthesis and electrochromic characteriza-
tion of two such materials based on dialkoxy-substituted thio-
phenes that bring us closer to completing the color palette. A
homopolymerofbis(ethylhexyloxy)thiophene(ECP-orange) that
switches from a highly saturated orange to near colorless trans-
missive is demonstrated. The electron-donating effect of the
disubstitution of two oxygens directly on the thiophene ring
allows for lowering of the oxidation potential to near that of
PEDOT, whereas branched alkyl groups induce solubility and
steric distortion of the neutral polymer backbone, shortening the
conjugation length and subsequently shifting the absorbance to
∼480 nm. Additionally, a 1:1 copolymer of bis(ethylhexyloxy)-
thiophene and dimethoxythiophene (ECP-red) was prepared
with a red neutral state that switches to a near colorless trans-
missive oxidized state at a low oxidation potential. Conversely,
the random incorporation of branched alkyl and short methoxy
substituents eases steric interactions, allowing for lengthening of
the average conjugation length, which red shifts the neutral state
absorbance by ∼40 nm relative to ECP-orange. Electrochemical,
spectroscopic, and full colorimetric characterizations are given
for both of these polymers, allowing the field to come closer to
full-color display applications.
Results and Discussion
Synthesis. The polymers were prepared by oxidative cou-
pling of the relevant dialkoxythiophene monomers with
excess iron(III) chloride in ethyl acetate at room tempera-
ture, with subsequent reduction by hydrazine. The choice of
ethyl acetate as solvent exploits the excellent solubility of
iron(III) chloride in this medium, affording an initially
homogeneous reaction mixture, which polymerizes rapidly.
It is notable that the conventional solvent system of chloro-
form, or a mixture of chloroform and methanol, retards
polymerization of these dialkoxythiophene moieties.36-38 A
five-fold excess of oxidant is employed to keep the oxidizing
strength of the reaction sufficiently high to maximize yield
and molecular weight.

polymers represented here were chosen such that their oxidized, transmissive state have a*b* values less than (5, indicating a near colorless oxidized
state. L*a*b* values are reported in the literature for ECP-purple,27 ECP-black,35 ECP-blue,34 ECP-turquoise,31 and ECP-green.31.

In the case of ECP-orange (P1), a very high molecular
weight with low polydispersity is achieved (Mn ca. 115-153
kDa, PDI = 1.27 to 1.79) whereas ECP-red (P2) exhibits a
lower molecular weight and broader polydispersity (Mn ca.
11-16 kDa, PDI = 2.12-4.38) (Schemes 1 and 2). The yield
of ECP-red is consistently modest in the range of 20-30%,
with losses incurred through removal of insoluble material of
higher molecular weight by filtration. We suspect that the
lower molecular weight of ECP-red relative to ECP-orange is
duetothedecreasedconformationalentropyofthedi(methoxy)-
thiophene monomer unit relative to the di(ethylhexyloxy)-
thiophene unit resulting in a lower overall solubility of the
copolymer in the reaction medium and thus limiting the
propagation of the polymer chain and broadening the poly-
dispersity. Whereas we expect the polymerization proceeds
in a near random manner, comparison of the integrals in 1H
NMR confirms the 1:1 ratio of 3,4-dimethoxythiophene to
3,4-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene moieties in ECP-red, as
shown in the Supporting Information. Both polymers have
good solubility in solvents for film-casting (in particular spray
casting) and demonstrate excellent film-forming characteristics.
Electrochemistry. The polymers were dissolved to a con-
centration of 1 mg/mL in either toluene for ECP-red or
dichloromethane for ECP-orange. Thin films of each poly-
mer were prepared on Pt button electrodes (A = 0.02 cm2) by
drop-casting from the polymer solution and allowing the
solvent to slowly evaporate by placement of the inverted
electrode in a draft-free environment. Once the solvent had
fully evaporated, cyclic voltammetric (CV) and differential
pulse voltammetric (DPV) measurements were performed in
a 0.2 M lithium bis(trifluoromethyl)sulfonylimide (LiBTI)/
propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte with a Pt flag counter
electrode and Ag/Agþ reference electrode, as described in
the Experimental Methods section. The orange polymer
required a break-in cycling of ∼5-10 full cycles depending
on the thickness of polymer deposited (Supporting Infor-
mation), whereas the red polymer did not require break-in
cycling. This result is not unexpected because of the high
polymer molecular weight of ECP-orange contributing to a
more densely packed film restricting full ion-solvent pene-
tration on initial scans. On multiple scans, the morphology
of the film opened up, and full electrochemical access is
achieved repeatedly. Attempts to confirm this using micro-
scopy methods were not fruitful because average feature sizes
of the spray-cast films were not large enough to visualize
using scanning electron microscopy (the films seem to be
smooth). Preliminary atomic force microscopy studies39
provide a topographic view of the films but do not elucidate
changes occurring with switching break in.
The CV and DPV results for both polymers are shown in
Figure 2A-D. ECP-orange exhibits an E1/2 of 0.37 V versus
Ag/Agþ and a peak-to-peak separation of 0.39 V, whereas
ECP-red polymer has an E1/2 of 0.21 V versus Ag/Agþ and a
peak-to-peak separation of 0.04 V. The smaller peak-to-peak
separation for ECP-red can be attributed to the faster
electron exchange between redox sites within the polymer
film and the working electrode surface. This is possibly due
to either the easier movement of the electrolyte within the
film of ECP-red or the smaller degree of structural rearrange-
ment of ECP-red when cycled between neutral (nonplanar
conformation) and oxidized (planar conformation) states.
The redox potentials for these polymers fall in the same
potential range for similar thiophene-based polymers, such
as 0.26 V versus Ag/Agþ for poly(3,4-dipropyloxythiophene)
and0.39VversusAg/Agþ forpoly(3,4-dioctyloxythiophene).40
The >150 mV higher redox potential for the orange polymer
relative to red is attributed to the pendant group bulkiness
and has been noted in similar disubstituted thiophene sys-
tems in the literature, where, for example, poly(3,4-dibuto-
xythiophene) has a 100 mV higher oxidation potential than
poly(3-butoxy-4-methylthiophene).41 Whereas the 3- and
4-substitutions of the electron-donating oxygen on the thio-
phene leads to a reduced oxidation potential in relation to an
alkyl-substituted polymer, disubstitution with bulky bran-
ched alkoxy groups leads to increased steric interactions in
the orange polymer resulting in a torqueing of the backbone,
shortening the mean conjugation length and subsequently
shifting the oxidation potential to a higher value. Random
incorporation of 3,4-dimethoxythiophene with 3,4-bis-ethyl-
hexyloxy thiophene in the red polymer relieves some of the
steric strain, giving a longer mean conjugation in the polymer
and a lower oxidation potential and is further seen in the
optical results given later. As a preliminary test for electro-
chromic utility, both polymers were subjected to repeated
electrochemical cycling (200 scans), as is shown in the
Supporting Information, and exhibited little change in redox
properties.
Spectroelectrochemistry. Films were spray-cast from solu-
tions containing the polymer dissolved to a concentration of
5 mg/mL in dichloromethane for ECP-orange and toluene
for ECP-red. Spray-casting was performed until the desired
absorption maximum was achieved (between 0.6 and 1.4 au).
The films appeared homogeneous and even to the eye, as
evident by the homogeneity in the photos in Figure 3.
Spectroelectrochemistry was performed in situ by measur-
ing the absorption spectrum of previously broken-in poly-
mer films spray-cast onto ITO/glass slides with a Pt wire
counter and Ag wire pseudo reference electrode (calibrated
with the Fc/Fcþ standard redox couple, which is found to be
-0.29 to -0.30 V relative to Ag/Agþ) in 0.2 M LiBTI/PC
contained in a cuvette. During spectroelectrochemical mea-
surement, the desired potential was applied to the film and
held with the increments of each potential step being between
10 and 20 mV. As can be seen in Figure 4A, ECP-orange has
a λmax centered at 483 nm with an absorption onset at 607 nm
corresponding to an optical bandgap of 2.04 eV. As each
potential is stepped, the absorption in the NIR begins to
increase, whereas that in the visible decreases, indicating the
creation of lower energy polaron and bipolaron charge
carriers at the expense of the π-to-π* transition. When fully
oxidized, the polymer has a strong absorption in the NIR
that tails into the visible, giving the polymer a highly
transmissive yet faint blue color due to residual red light
absorbance. A noteworthy feature of this polymer is the large
optical change in both the visible and NIR between a small
potential step of 30 mV when stepped from 0.39 and 0.42 V,
with a contrast of 76.9% at 1650 nm. We speculate that this
large change in optical absorption over a small voltage range
may be due to a cooperative intramolecular domino effect

similar to the “twistons” described by Leclerc for the thermo-
chromism of alkyl- and alkoxy-substituted thiophenes.42,43
In the neutral state, the polymer exists in a nonplanar (less
conjugated) form, and at initially low applied potentials, a
low concentration of localized portions of the polymer chain
become oxidized to a more planar (highly conjugated) form.
However, as the applied potential is increased and a higher
concentration of repeat units becomes oxidized, a coopera-
tive mechanism comes into play where the twisting of these
first repeat units to the more planar conformation induces a
twisting of a larger number of neighboring units. This is in
contrast with ECP-red, where the oxidation proceeds with a
monotonic change in the optical transitions, as seen in
Figure 4B for the spectroelectrochemical series of ECP-red.
This polymer has a λmax in the neutral state of 525 nm and an
absorption onset of 620 nm corresponding to a bandgap of
2.0 eV with lower energy electronic transitions emerging on
oxidation at the expense of the π-to-π* transition.
Electrochromic Contrast and Switching Speed. The differ-
ence in the ease with which the two polymers are oxidized is
also evident in Figure 5A,B, which shows the change in
transmittance measured as the rate of switching the polymer
film, between fully oxidized and neutralized, is increased.
Specifically, for ECP-orange, as the polymer is switched
between the potentials of -0.73 and 0.57 V with a 30 s hold
at each potential, the percent transmittance (%T) contrast is
47.2%. As the time the oxidizing and reducing potentials are
held is decreased to 10 s, the contrast decreases only slightly
to 44.9% and subsequently to 42.6% for a 5 s hold, 13.6% for
a 1 s hold, and 7.4% for a half second hold. As for ECP-red,
when switched between -0.72 and 0.38 V versus Ag/Agþ,
the contrast is 60.6% for a 30 s hold, 60.2% for 10 s, 59.9%
for 5 s, 30.6% for 1 s, and 16.5% for half second hold. A
direct comparison of the switching speeds for these two
films can be made as the optical density of each polymer
at λmax in the neutral state is the same. To allow direct
comparison of the optical switching properties between
several films, we utilize the measurement of optical den-
sity rather than film thickness. This is because spray-cast
polymer films are relatively rough with the measured thick-
ness varying greatly across the films, rendering the deter-
mination of average film thickness using conventional
metrology methods difficult.39

An additional factor in switching times is how quickly the
polymers can reach a full contrast during steady-state mea-
surements. The steady-state switching speed is typically
represented as the time required for the polymer to reach
95% of full contrast when switched from neutral (highly
absorptive) to fully oxidized (highly transmissive).44 The
value of 95% is chosen as the human eye is relatively insen-
sitive to the final 5% of a color change with little discerned
between 95 and 100% of a full optical contrast. The time to
reach 95% of a full optical contrast (t95) when switched from
fully neutralized to fully oxidized for films of varying optical
density of both ECP-orange and ECP-red is given in Table 1.
Not surprisingly, the time required for a film of ECP-orange
to reach 95% of a full optical contrast ranges from 1.5 to 3.5
times longer than that for ECP-red, depending on the optical
density. We attribute the slower switching speeds and longer
t95 for ECP-orange, relative to ECP-red, to the more densely
packed films for ECP-orange, leading to counterion diffu-
sion in and out of the film to be hindered, slowing the charge
balancing of the redox sites within the polymer film.
Colorimetry. Whereas optical spectroscopy measurements
of conjugated electroactive polymers convey important
information about the electronic transitions and how those
change as a function of redox chemistry, they do not yield
significant information about the color of the polymer
film and how that color is perceived by the human eye.

An additional important characterization tool for electro-
chromic materials is that of colorimetry, where the color of
the material is represented quantitatively, allowing for effec-
tive comparison of the color of a material as it is switched in
addition to comparison between various electrochromic
materials.45-48 While there are many methods to quantify
and represent color, one of the most widely applicable to
measuring color of materials illuminated by a standard light
source is the 1976 CIE LAB (or L*a*b*) with the value of L*
representing how light versus dark the measured material is,
the value a* representing how red versus green, and b*
representing how yellow versus blue the material is, as
plotted for several ECPs in Figure 1. In this work, we mea-
sured the CIE 1931 Yxy values using a Minolta CS-100
colorimeter as the polymer film is illuminated from behind
(transmission measurement method) with a standard D50
light source with the CIE LAB values calculated using
methods standardized by CIE.45,47,48
The Yxy values are measured in situ as each potential is
applied across the polymer film that was spray-cast onto an
ITO electrode and immersed in an electrolyte-filled cuvette.
From these measurements, the L*, a*, and b* values are
calculated for each applied potential. Figure 6A (ECP-
orange) and Figure 6B (ECP-red) give the a*b* values plotted
for each applied potential for three varied thicknesses (optical
density) of polymer film. In addition, the values for fully
neutralized and fully oxidized polymer films are given in
Table 1. As can be seen in Figure 6A, ECP-orange has a color
near equidistant between red and yellow in the neutral state
and follows a linear path to the origin of the plot as the
polymer becomes oxidized and transmissive. As is expected,
the film with the highest optical density has the most saturated
color in the neutral state, but a transmissive oxidized state
with the highest amount of residual light-blue color, whereas
the film with the lowest optical density has the least saturated
neutral state and most color-neutral oxidized transmissive
state. Similar to the spectroelectrochemistry for ECP-orange,
a large color change occurs over a small applied voltage range.
As shown in Figure 6B, the film of ECP-red with the
highest optical density has a highly saturated red color in the
neutral state but has a slight contribution of yellow when
compared with the polymer film with the lowest optical
density. As increasing positive potentials are applied to the
polymer films, the a* value decreases with both the a* and b*
values close to 0 for the fully oxidized polymer, indicating a
near colorless transmissive state. As can be seen in Figure 6B
and in Table 1, whereas the intensity of red, given by more
positive a* values, is higher for the film with the highest
optical density and lower for that with the lowest optical
density, there is little affect on the oxidized state with all three
film having nearly the same near colorless state.
When considering the color of a material, the luminance
(lightness or darkness) is also an important measurement
given that the measured transmittance is the linear response
of a photodetector to changes in the intensity of light,
whereas luminance is weighted to the response of the human
eye and is therefore more sensitive to perceptions in changes
in the brightness of a sample.48 The percent luminance is
most commonly measured relative to a background and
given by the relative percent luminance, %Y = 100(Y/Yn).
The percent luminance measured at each applied potential is
plotted for several thicknesses of ECP-orange (Figure 7A)
and ECP-red (Figure 7B) in addition to luminance change
(Δ%Y) values in Table 1. It is not unexpected that the %Y
contrast for the polymers is less than the %T contrast with
the change in luminance nearly 1.5 times less than the change
in transmittance for ECP-red and nearly three times less for
ECP-orange. This can be understood by comparing the
spectrum of ECP-red, which peaks at ∼525 nm, to that of
orange, which peaks at ∼484 nm, and how well they overlap
with the photopic luminosity function that peaks at 555 nm
and is used in the calculation of luminance.45
Perspective
The field of conjugated ECPs has seen a growing interest,
especially with the availability of commercially available forms of
the solution processable PEDOT. However, the availability of
fully solution processable polymers exhibiting a variety of colors
in the neutral state remains limited. Recent efforts with the
introduction of donor-acceptor concepts has made available
polymers that switch from blue, turquoise, green, and even black
to transmissive with the hue in the neutral state tunable through
synthetic methodologies. Much attention has been focused
toward the necessity for red, green, and blue materials to allow
for additive color displays where the ECP would act as a color
filter for a white backlight. If full color displays are desired where
the ECP is an active colorant, such as would be in subtractive
color displays, then a trichromatic set of polymers of either cyan,
magenta, yellow or red, yellow, blue, is necessary. As the palette
of colors available for ECPs widens, so does their opportunity for

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods. Lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfo-
nimide (LiBTI) (>95%, Fluka) was used as received. PC
(anhydrous, 99.7%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as received and
stored under Argon. 3,4-Dimethoxythiophene was purchased
from AK Scientific and used as received. 1H NMR spectra were
collected on a 300 MHz Varian VXR or a Unity Inova 500 MHz
using CDCl3. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was
performed using a Waters Associates GPCV2000 liquid chro-
matography system with its internal differential refractive index
detector (DRI) at 40 C, using either two Waters Styragel
HR-5E columns (10 μm PD, 7.8 mm i.d., 300 mm length) or a
Polymer Laboratories PLgel Mixed-C (5 μm, 300  7.5 mm) and
a PL mixed-C guard (5 μm, 50  7.5 mm) with HPLC grade
THF as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Injections
were made at 0.05 to 0.07% w/v sample concentration using a
220.5 μL injection volume. Retention times were calibrated
against narrow molecular weight polystyrene standards (Polymer
Laboratories, Amherst, MA).
Electrochemistry. Electrochemical measurements were per-
formed using a three-electrode cell with a platinum wire or a Pt
flag as the counter electrode, Ag/Agþ reference electrode, or a
silver wire pseudoreference electrode calibrated using a 5 mM
solution of Fc/Fcþ in 0.2 M LiClO4 acetonitrile (ACN) electro-
lyte. The working electrode was either a platinum button
(0.02 cm2) purchased from Bioanalytical Systems or an ITO-coated
glass slide (7  50  0.7 mm, sheet resistance, Rs 8-12 Ω/sq)
purchased from Delta Technologies. An EG&G Princeton
Applied Research model 273A potentiostat/galvanostat was
used under the control of Corrware software. The electrolyte
solution was purged with argon before electrochemical mea-
surements performed.
Spectroscopy and Colorimetry. Absorption spectra were per-
formed using a Varian Cary 500 UV-vis/NIR spectrophoto-
meter. In situ colorimetric measurements were performed using
a Minolta CS100 colorimeter in transmission mode with a
GraphicLite LiteGuard II standard D50 light source. The light
source and the sample to be measured were placed in a color
viewing booth. The interior of the light booth is coated with a
standard gray neutral 8 (GTI Graphic Technology, Inc.) matte
latex enamel (equivalent to Munsell N8) to allow for accurate
assessment of color of the sample during measurement. Photo-
graphy was performed in the same light booth using a FujiFilm
FinePix S7000 at a shutter speed of 1/160 s, f-stop of f/4,
aperture value of f/4.0, ISO of 200, and focal length of 18 mm.
The photograph file-type was JPEG, and the files were cropped
to only the polymer film to exclude extraneous background
using Photoshop. No additional alterations to the files were
performed.
Synthesis.
3,4-(2-Ethylhexyloxy)-thiophene. The synthesis
of this monomer was reported previously,35 and has been
modified as follows: In a round-bottomed flask, 3,4-dimethoxy-
thiophene (33.4 g, 0.23 mol), 2-ethylhexanol (80 g, 0.61 mol),
and p-toulenesulfonic acid monohydrate (4.4 g, 0.023 mol) were
combined in toluene (1000 mL). The flask was equipped with a
simple distillation head and heated initially to 110 C. Under a
mild flow of nitrogen, the temperature was adjusted to allow for
a slow distillation of methanol. The reaction was monitored by
TLC. After 7 h, the reaction was allowed to cool. The organics
were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and
dried (MgSO4). The solvent was stripped and the residue was
distilled, giving the product as a colorless oil: (65 g, 83%) bp

(t, J = 7 Hz, 12H).
Poly{3,4-di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene} (ECP-Orange). In a
round-bottomed flask, iron(III) chloride (1.43 g, 14.68 mmol)
was dissolved in ethyl acetate (10 mL) and stirred under ambient
atmosphere. 3,4-Di(2-ethylhexyloxy)thiophene (1 g, 2.94 mmol)
was dissolved in ethyl acetate (10 mL) and added to the stirred
solution of iron(III) chloride. The reaction mixture immedia-
tely turned dark green and was stirred overnight at room
temperature. Methanol (80 mL) was added, and the mixture
was stirred for 5 min. The doped polymer was collected by
suction filtration and washed with methanol (2  20 mL). The
doped polymer was suspended in chloroform (50 mL), and
hydrazine monohydrate (2 mL) was added dropwise, effecting
