Tunable green electrochromic polymers via direct
arylation polymerization†

A method to tune the hues of neutral green conjugated electrochromic polymers (NG-ECP) via direct
C–H arylation polymerization (DArP) was developed. We used 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothidiazole and
2,7-dibromoﬂuorene to randomly copolymerize with ProDOT via DArP and successfully obtained a series
of green polymers. On varying the ratio of 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothidiazole and 2,7-dibromoﬂuorene,
we can readily adjust the relative intensity of two absorption bands in the visible-light wavelength region,
which leads to four green polymers with diﬀerent hues being obtained. Speciﬁcally, increasing the ratio of
4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothidiazole leads to the enhancement of the polymer absorption intensity in the
long wavelength (∼550–700 nm) region, while increasing the ratio of 2,7-dibromoﬂuorene will lead to the
increase of the polymer absorption intensity in the short wavelength (∼400–500 nm) region. Via the
random direct arylation polymerization of multi-component monomers in various ratios, we can precisely
control the absorption spectra of neutral green conjugated electrochromic polymers (NG-ECPs) in the
visible-light wavelength region. The electrochemical and optical properties, spectroelectrochemical
behaviors, and electrochromic performance of these NG-ECPs were characterized and they showed
great potential for electrochromic devices such as smart windows and transmissive displays.
Introduction
In the last few decades, electrochromic conjugated polymers
(ECPs) have attracted a great deal of attention for their process-
ability,
flexibility,
and
tunable
colors
through
structural
design.1 The potential application of ECPs in displays,2,3 smart
windows,4,5 E-paper,6 and data-storage devices7 drives the
scientific community to create all kinds of conjugated poly-
mers for electrochromic devices. However, most of them are
either red or blue in their neutral states, and the green color
electrochromic polymers have been rarely reported. In 2004,
Wudl et al. reported the first neutral green conjugated ECP
(NG-ECP)8 and there have been only a few other updates until
now.9–22 Great challenges still remain in designing new mono-
mers to tune the spectra of ECPs to achieve green conjugated
polymers in the neutral state, since NG-ECPs have dual-band
absorption in both short wavelength (∼400 nm–500 nm) and
long wavelength (∼550 nm–700 nm) regions of visible light.
Moreover, the color of the as-polymerized NG-ECP was not
tunable in most of the cases.16,23 For example, Reynolds et al.
reported
a
donor–acceptor
NG-ECP
of
dioxythiophene-
benzothiadiazole.14,16 The color of the NG-ECP can only be
tuned by changing the structures of the polymer repeat-unit.
However, preparation of the monomers was complicated and
needed multiple steps. Therefore, a generalized and viable
method is desired to realize such unique dual-band absorption
of ECPs, so that the molecular spectra can be tuned specifi-
cally to be transmissive in a certain range of wavelength.
Herein, we reported our approach for achieving tunable
NG-ECPs via direct C–H arylation polymerization (DArP). DArP
is an environment-friendly polymerization method for donor–
acceptor (D–A) type conjugated polymers.24–28 The easy-to-
make monomers, simple purification procedures, and low
metal residue have made it an ideal method for the synthesis
of conjugated ECPs. It is already known that the homopolymer
of 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) had magenta color
and narrow absorption around 550 nm.29 By copolymerizing
ProDot with 1,3-benzothiadiazole as an acceptor, a blue conju-
gated ECP which had a main absorption in the red-light area
can be synthesized.30 Moreover, a yellow color conjugated ECP
which had a main absorption in the blue-light area can be
achieved by using fluorene as the acceptor and ProDOT as the
donor.31–33 Thus, if an approach to combine the absorption
character of blue and yellow ECPs can be discovered, we would
be able to obtain green polymers which can absorb in both
regions. Herein, we used 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothidiazole

and
2,7-dibromofluorene
to
randomly
copolymerize
with
ProDOT via DArP and successfully obtained a series of
NG-ECPs. With the increasing ratio of electron-deficient 2,1,3-
benzothidiazole, the intensity of the first absorption peak
(∼600 nm) decreased. At the same time, with the addition of
fluorene,
the
intensity
of
the
second
absorption
peak
(∼450 nm) increased due to the increase of the ProDOT–fluo-
rene twist angle. With the addition of both 2,1,3-benzothidi-
azole and fluorene, we can readily adjust the relative intensity
of the two absorption bands to obtain four green polymers
with diﬀerent hues.
Results and discussion
Polymer and oligomer synthesis
The synthesis of monomers is shown in the ESI.† The syn-
thesis of polymers is shown in Scheme 1. At first, we made P1
to test our assumption that inserting 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
and
fluorene
into
poly-3,4-propylenedioxythiophene
(PProDOT) will lead to two-band absorption in the red-light
and blue-light regions. We used 0.25 equivalents of 4,7-
dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (compound 6), 0.35 equiva-
lents of 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene (compound 3),
and 0.4 equivalents of dibromo-ProDOT (compound 5) to ran-
domly copolymerize with 1.0 equivalent of ProDOT (compound 4)
via DArP and obtained polymer P1. The solution state
UV-Vis spectrum of P1 shows two peaks with a higher absorp-
tion peak at 440 nm and another peak at 594 nm (Fig. 1a). The
valley point is located at 529 nm. Although the color of the
polymer was not green, the two-band absorption spectrum
encouraged us to further optimize the monomer ratio. We
increased the equivalents of compound 6 from 0.25 to 0.3 and
decreased the equivalents of compound 3 from 0.35 to 0.3.
Then,
we
obtained
polymer
P2
via
the
DArP
method.
Interestingly, the UV-Vis spectrum of P2 shows that the inten-
sity of these two peaks was reversed compared with P1. The
higher absorption peak changes to ∼594 nm and the weaker
peak locates at ∼440 nm (Fig. 1a). These results indicated that
we could control the absorption intensity in the red-light and
blue-light regions by varying the equivalents of compound 6
and compound 3. Based on these results, the green conjugated
polymers can be obtained by either increasing the ratio of
compound 6 in P1 or increasing the ratio of compound 3 in
P2. Therefore, we added 0.3 equivalents of compound 6, 0.35
equivalents of compound 3, and 0.35 equivalents of com-
pound 5 to randomly copolymerize with 1.0 equivalent of com-
pound 4 to prepare a new polymer P3. P3 had a dark green
color and a standard two-band UV-Vis absorption in the solu-
tion state (Fig. 1b). Following the same strategy, we success-
fully made another three green polymers (P4, P5, and P6) by
changing the ratio of compound 6 and compound 3. We calcu-

lated the x/y/z composition of each polymer according to the
value of 1H NMR integration and the results are shown in ESI
Table S1.† All the number-average molecular weights (Mn) of
the polymers were determined using GPC and the data are
shown in Table 1.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of four green polymers were
examined both in CHCl3 solution (Fig. 1b) and in the thin-film
state (Fig. 2a). Two distinct peaks were found both in the solu-
tion state and thin-film state. Comparing the UV-vis spectra in
the thin-film state with the solution state, obvious red-shifts
can be observed for both peaks due to the eﬃcient self-stack-
ing of the backbone in the solid state. From P3 to P6, a blue
shift in the solution and film state was observed for both
peaks, with the increase of the ratio of compound 6 and com-
pound 3. Moreover, the valleys of the two peaks shift from
520 nm to 483 nm in the solution state and shift from 539 nm
to 491 nm in the film state (Fig. 1b and Fig. 2a).
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the electro-
chemical behaviour of the green polymers (Fig. 2b). The
polymer thin-films were deposited onto Pt disk electrodes via
drop-casting from CHCl3 solution at room temperature. Pt and
Ag/AgCl wires were used as the counter and reference electro-
des, respectively. The polymer films were cycled at a scan rate
of 40 mV s−1 between −0.2 V and 1.3 V until the cyclic voltam-
mograms became stable and reproducible. The polymer films
were found to be stable during the p-type doping within this
potential range. According to the onset potentials of oxidation
of green polymers and their optical band gaps, the HOMO
energy levels varied from −4.97 eV to −5.27 eV; the LUMO
energy levels changed from −3.33 eV to −3.66 eV. Upon careful
examination of the data presented in Table 1 and Fig. 2b, we
found that oxidation potentials increased when increasing the
ratio of compound 6 and compound 3.
Spectroelectrochemical analysis
The spectroelectrochemical analyses of P3, P4, P5 and P6 were
carried out with in situ UV-vis-NIR while changing the applied
potential (Fig. 3). The thin films of the green polymers were
deposited (ca. 40 mg mL−1) onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated
glass slides via spin-coating from CHCl3 solution at room
temperature. The polymer films were cycled within the corres-
ponding potential range based on the CV studies (Fig. 2b) at a
scan rate of 40 mV s−1 in 0.2 M TBAP/PC electrolyte solution
until they exhibited stable and reproducible switching. Upon
stepwise oxidation, the intensity of the two absorption bands
in the blue-light and red-light regions began to diminish, and
the absorption in the near-IR region started to increase
because of the formation of polarons and bipolarons. It was
worth noting that the absorption valley of all the green
polymers didn’t change too much during the oxidation

process, indicating that the thin films remained green all the
time. The residue absorption in the visible region made the
polymer films exhibit a transmissive light green in the
bleached state.
Electrochromic properties
Electrochromic switching studies of P4 and P6 were performed
to study the transmittance changes when applying square-wave
potential steps with switching intervals ranging from 20 to 3 s.
The chronoamperometry analysis is shown in Fig. S11.† Both
green polymers had a similar optical contrast in the two
absorption bands. At 20 s intervals, for the shorter wavelength
absorption band, the optical contrasts of P4 and P6 were 51%
and 56%. For the longer wavelength absorption band, the con-
trasts were 32% and 35% respectively. For both green poly-
mers, optical contrasts at the shorter wavelength (420 nm/
430 nm) decreased significantly at 3 s switching intervals,
while the optical contrast at the longer wavelength (600 nm)
only decreased slightly.
The colorimetric performances of four green polymers were
tested with spin-coating films on ITO-coated glasses. The color
changes resulting from the redox switching of the films were
characterized based on the ‘Commission Internationale de l′
Eclairage’ 1976 L*a*b* color standards. The L*a*b* color
spaces of all polymers were obtained by using the Star-Tek col-
orimetry software with a D50 illuminant and 2-degree obser-
ver.31 Fig. S12† shows the lightness change of the green
polymer films in their colored state and bleached state. With
increasing voltage, all the films showed an increase of the

L* value. P3 started to change the L* value at ∼0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl,
while the L* value of P6 began to increase at ∼0.8 V vs.
Ag/AgCl, which is consistent with the oxidation onsets shown
in the CVs of the thin films of the green polymers (Fig. 2b). To
mathematically analyze the colors of all the green polymers,
their a* and b* in both colored and bleached states are shown
in Fig. 4. The more negative the value of a* is, the greener the
polymer appears. The positive and negative value of b* indi-
cates a yellow and blue hue, respectively. In the colored state,
all of the four polymers had a positive value of b* and a nega-
tive value of a*, which means they all present a chartreuse
(yellow-green) color. In previous literature, most of the green
conjugated ECPs showed a very diﬀerent color in the colored
state and bleached state, and it’s rare to see a green polymer
that shows a similar type of color in the colored state and
bleached state.20 Our polymers provided more choice for the
green ECP family.
The electrochemical stability of the green polymers was
tested with spin-coating thin films on ITO-coated glasses.
Fig. S13† reveals that the polymer thin films exhibited a
decrease of about 20% of transmittance at 430 nm after 644
cycles under ambient conditions. An electrochromic device
was developed with P4 as the working electrode and a PEDOT/
PSS layer as the counter electrode. The device architecture is
shown in Fig. 5a. A PEDOT/PSS layer with a thickness of
0.05 mm controlled by a square tape (1.6 × 1.6 cm) in the
center was coated on the outside margin of the ITO substrate
by drop-casting. The tape was removed after the PEDOT/PSS
layer was dried. By using this architecture, the deep blue color
of the PEDOT/PSS would not aﬀect the green polymer layer
which was coated in the center of another ITO substrate.
Here, the PEDOT/PSS layer showed no color change during
the switching of the device indicating that the micrometer
thick PEDOT/PSS layer had a much higher redox capacity than
the green polymer layer. Thus, this is also an ‘unbalanced con-
figuration’ investigated by Hassab et al.34 When a potential of
1.2 V was applied to the device, it became transmissive but
when the potential was switched to −0.5 V, the device recov-
ered to its green state (Fig. 5b). The optical contrast of the
device is 42.3%, and the switching time for the device to
achieve 95% of the contrast is 25.9 s and 5.9 s for bleached
and colored processes, respectively (Fig. 5c).
Conclusions
A series of conjugated polymer electrochromes composed of
3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) units, 9,9-dihexyl-9H-
fluorene units and the electron-deficient core 2,1,3-benzothia-
diazole (BTD) was rationally designed to achieve neutral green
colors. We highlight the random direct arylation polymeriz-
ation of multi-component monomers to precisely control the
absorption spectra of polymers in the visible light region. The
electrochemical and optical properties, spectroelectrochemical
analysis, and electrochromic performance of these green poly-
mers were tested. This straight-forward strategy that can adjust
the absorption spectra of ECPs is applicable to other polymer
systems with diﬀerent types of co-monomers.
