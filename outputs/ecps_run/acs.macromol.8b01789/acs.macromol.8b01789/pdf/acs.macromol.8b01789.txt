ABSTRACT: A series of conjugated polymers are prepared via
direct heteroarylation polymerization with the goal of yielding
wide-gap, yellow and orange switching to transmissive cathodi-
cally coloring electrochromic polymers (ECPs). The polymers
are based on repeat units of dialkylthiophene (DAT) in alterna-
tion with dioxythiophenes (DOTs) with various side chains to
induce diﬀering levels of inter-ring strain yielding 3,4-ethylene-
dioxythiophene (DAT-EDOT), 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene
(DAT-ProDOT), 3,4-(1,3-dimethylpropylene)dioxythiophene
(DAT-DMP), and 3,4-dimethoxythiophene (DAT-DMOT)
structured polymers. Examination of the optoelectronic proper-
ties via UV−vis−NIR spectroscopy, diﬀerential pulse voltammetry, and spectroelectrochemistry shows that while increasing the
inter-ring strain induced by the side chain of the DOT unit leads to an increased oxidation potential ranging from −122 to
+288 mV relative to Fc/Fc+, this does not decrease the accessibility of the extreme charge states. Through subtle steric interac-
tions between the arylene units, neutral polymer colors were tunable from yellow to deep reds while maintaining transmissive
oxidized states. These DAT-based polymers also show increased redox switching stability compared to that of previous gen-
erations of wide-gap cathodically coloring ECPs that incorporate phenylene units with DAT-ProDOT and DAT-DMP ﬁlms
showing minimal loss of electrochromic contrast over 1000 switches and a DAT-DMP device showing minimal contrast loss over
10000 cycles. With these properties, these polymers have the ability for subtractive color mixing with other ECPs to create
broadly absorbing, color neutral (black and brown) blends that are redox stable.
■INTRODUCTION
Redox-active conjugated polymers have structurally controlled
optical properties with redox switching capabilities that make
them attractive to study with reference to the application of
electrochromism.1−9 Organic electrochromic polymers (ECPs)
can be solution processed under ambient conditions and are
lightweight and ﬂexible, while providing a ﬁne degree of struc-
turally induced color control. The electrochromic performance
of ECPs has undergone vast improvement over recent years
due to an increased understanding of their fundamental electro-
chemical and spectral/colorimetric properties, solution process-
ing characteristics, thin ﬁlm morphologies, and interactions with
electrodes.10−22
The history of research in fully conjugated ECPs has yielded
materials that span the entire color palette.23−29 These poly-
mers can be spray cast to form vividly colored ﬁlms that upon
oxidation become highly transmissive in the visible region.
Recently, the approaches toward creating black-to-transmissive
electrochromic polymeric materials have been either through
the generation of broadly absorbing random copolymers or via
subtractive color mixing of polymeric inks.30−37 The latter of
the two approaches has, to date, allowed for ﬁner control, more
accurate reproducibility, and higher contrast through the mixing
of cyan, magenta, and yellow to create broadly absorbing ECP
blends. One of the largest challenges to date with using the
solution blending technique relates to the short switching
lifetime of the yellow to clear switching polymer.38−44
In order for an ECP to be yellow, it requires a high-energy
optical absorption, between 380 and 550 nm in the colored state.
To then exhibit a high visible light contrast during switching, a
cathodically coloring ECP then requires its oxidized state to
absorb in the near-infrared (>700 nm). ECPs we have developed
that have these optical properties have historically used phenylene
units in the backbone of the polymer, which oﬀer both a deep
HOMO and a torsional strain that lowers π−π overlap along the
backbone and widens the gap, relative to their all dioxythiophene
counterparts. These phenylene-containing ECPs tend to have
higher oxidation potentials than all thiophene polymers due to
the larger energy of aromaticity relative to thiophene. These
high oxidation potentials are hypothesized to be one of the
causes of why yellow ECPs tend to have shorter switching
lifetimes. Along with these high oxidation potentials there are
open sites for reactivity of the radical cation states when the
polymer is oxidized, leaving potential for nucleophilic attack

and radical−radical coupling. To this end we sought an alter-
native monomer to use in electron-rich cathodically coloring
electrochromic polymers.
Figure 1 shows some key polymers in the progression of
designing soluble, yellow and orange electrochromic polymers
leading to the design of the current generation. Starting with
generation 1, ProDOT-Ph was the ﬁrst successful synthesis of a
yellow to clear ECP using the phenylenes. When this material
is sprayed into a ﬁlm onto an ITO working electrode and
subjected to repeated potential square waves that oxidize and
reduce the polymer, it shows instability to switching within the
ﬁrst 10−20 cycles due to the high oxidation potential required
to switch and the potential reactivity of the phenylene unit
itself in the charged state.45 The design rationale for AcDOT2-Ph
was to increase the electron-rich dioxythiophene content of the
polymer to lower the oxidation potential and maintain the wide
gap by using the increased inter-ring strain provided by the
acyclic nature of the AcDOT unit. This polymer is slightly more
stable than ProDOT-Ph showing signiﬁcant drops in contrast
within the ﬁrst 100 redox cycles. The second-generation
polymers were synthesized to attempt to address these issues
by incorporating methoxy groups on the phenylene portion of
the polymer to simultaneously lower the oxidation potential to
switch and sterically block the open sites from nucleophilic
attack and radical coupling.39 While AcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 main-
tains a vibrant yellow color, the increased strain imparted by the
Ph(OMe)2 unit causes the polymer to have a high oxida-
tion potential and only a marginal increase in redox stability.
During redox switching, ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 lasts over 100
cycles with no drop in contrast, but the decrease in strain red-
shifts the absorbance λmax by 54 nm, leading to a red-orange
polymer.
To overcome the issues with the redox switching stability in
wide-gap phenylene-containing ECPs, here we report on the
use of a dialkylthiophene (DAT) incorporated into alternating
copolymers with dioxythiophenes to achieve a wide optical
gap. The DAT monomer synthesized and used for the genera-
tion 3 study, speciﬁcally 3,4-dioctylthiophene, provides inter-
ring strain with alkyl chains directly appended to the backbone
helping the copolymers to reach wide optical gaps while
blocking possible reactive sites for the radical cations. The
octyl groups allow for the use of DOT monomers that do not
have side chains and still yield soluble polymers than can be
spray processed into thin ﬁlms for characterization and use.
The DOT comonomers were designed to vary in the inter-ring
strain they provide to the π-conjugated backbone of the sys-
tem. We show that increasing inter-ring strain can be used to
blue-shift the absorption of the polymers by over 70 nm to
tune color between yellows, oranges, and reds. We also show
that three of the copolymers show increased redox switching
stability as ﬁlms in solution compared to previous wide-gap
ECPs with minimal drops in contrast over 1000 cycles in elec-
trolyte solution. Because of its lack of color shifting upon repeated
redox cycling, the redox stability of DAT-DMP is investigated
further in the construction of an encapsulated device contain-
ing DAT-DMP and a charge-storing polymer separated by a gel
electrolyte. After an initial equilibration period of 200 switches,
this device shows a contrast loss of <5 Δ%T after 10000 cycles,
which indicates a >81% retention of contrast overall.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Polymer Synthesis and Characterization. The synthetic
approach to the monomer and polymer syntheses is shown in
Scheme 1. Synthetic procedures, NMR spectra, elemental analyses,
and GPC traces are located in the Supporting Information. Start-
ing with commercially available 3,4-dibromothiophene, a Kumada
coupling aﬀorded 2, followed by subsequent bromination with
NBS to form the desired 2,5-dibromo-3,4-dioctylthiophene, 3.
The synthetic scheme diverges from here where 3 can be used
for direct heteroarylation polymerization with a dioxythio-
phene monomer to prepare the alternating copolymers DAT-
EDOT, DAT-ProDOT, DAT-DMP, and DAT-DMOT.46−48
Comparisons of polymerization yields and GPC estimated
molecular weights are collated in Table 1, and all GPC traces
are shown in Figure S1. All of the polymers are soluble in
toluene to at least 20 mg/mL, allowing for airbrush spray
processing and drop casting for ﬁlm formation.

Electrochemical and Optical Properties. For electro-
chemical characterization, polymer ﬁlms were drop cast onto
Pt button electrodes from 3 mg/mL solutions in CHCl3 to
cover the electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and diﬀerential
pulse voltammetry (DPV) were measured on ﬁlms of the poly-
mers to gain insight into how the diﬀerent DOT comonomers
aﬀected the electrochemical properties. Upon examining the
electrochemical oxidation of the materials via DPV (Figure 2a),
the onset of oxidation follows the trend of inter-ring strain
imposed by the DOT comonomer (CV for polymers can be
found in Figure S2). As inter-ring strain is increased from the
least strained EDOT to the most strained DMOT, the resultant
onset of oxidation (Eox) ranges from −122 to +288 mV relative
to Fc/Fc+, giving a large window for tuning the desired optical
switching potential (Eox values are collated in Table 2). These
polymers all have Eox values below the polymers in the
generation one wide-gap polymers (ProDOT-Ph and
AcDOT2-Ph). Both DAT-EDOT and DAT-ProDOT have
Eox values below that of the generation 2 polymers (ProDOT2-
Ph(OMe)2 and AcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2) at −122 and 74 mV,
respectively. The DAT-DMP and DAT-DMOT polymers’ Eox
values fall between ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 and AcDOT2-Ph-
(OMe)2 with 180 and 288 mV, respectively.
For optical characterization, polymer ﬁlms were airbrush
sprayed onto glass/ITO electrodes from 3 mg/mL solutions in
toluene, and the ﬁlms subjected to 10 CV cycles before UV−
vis spectra were measured. While DAT-ProDOT, DAT-DMP,
and DAT-DMOT all formed smooth ﬁlms from this method,
DAT-EDOT ﬁlms were consistently hazy, which is indicative
of induced order during ﬁlm formation. Figure 2b shows the
UV−vis spectra of the ﬁlms of the polymers after electro-
chemical conditioning (UV−vis spectra of as-cast ﬁlms can be
found in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). The
UV−vis absorption data are collated in Table 2 in order of

increasing λmax, including the previous generation polymers. It
is important to note that the λmax and Eg do not follow the
same trend as there is varying absorption broadness between
the diﬀerent polymers. This varying broadness manifests itself
in the color of the polymer ﬁlms not correlating with λmax, as
these polymers span the yellow−orange−red region. It should
be noted that when comparing as-cast ﬁlms to conditioned
ﬁlms, the polymers’ absorbances typically exhibit varying
degrees of red-shifting and broadening. When a polymer ﬁlm is
sprayed from a high vapor pressure solvent, it is deposited in a
kinetically determined morphology as the solvent evaporates.49
Upon electrochemical oxidation, the conjugated polymer must
enter a more quinoid-like structure that causes its backbone to
planarize and extend the eﬀective conjugation length of the
chromophore. Upon reduction back to the neutral state, the
polymer geometry retains a more planar geometry (relative to
the as-cast ﬁlm) leading to a longer eﬀective conjugation length
and red-shifted absorbance. This typical red-shifting upon
cycling was not observed for DAT-DMP as its absorbance
exhibited a small blue-shift of its onset of ∼5 nm.
Spectroelectrochemistry and Color Properties. Spec-
troelectrochemical measurements were performed on polymer
ﬁlms sprayed on ITO glass in 0.5 M TBAPF6 in propylene
carbonate with a platinum counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl
reference electrode with results shown in Figure 3 along with
photographs of the ﬁlms held at potential extremes dictated by
the CV results. Optical contrast at λmax and the L*a*b* values
are collated in Table 3. Upon electrochemical conditioning of
electrochromic polymers, the UV−vis absorption often exhibits
a characteristic red-shift of the absorbance as the polymer
extends its eﬀective conjugation length in the charge neutral
state.
As a pristine ﬁlm, DAT-EDOT shown in Figure 3a absorbs
with a λmax of 448 nm giving rise to the orange color of the
material. As can be seen in the photography it can be noted
that this polymer forms relatively hazy ﬁlms. Upon electro-
chemical break-in, there is a red-shifting of the onset of

the peak evolution as a function of increasing potential.

absorbance with the appearance of a shoulder at 650 nm, but
there is a drop in absorbance at λmax and a low intensity, broad
absorbance between 600 and 1100 nm indicative of polaron
trapping. This broad absorption gives rise to the observed
muted pink color of the material. It is unknown whether this
phenomenon is caused by either chemical or morphological
diﬀerences from the other polymers. The trapping in DAT-
EDOT is hypothesized to be due to the oxidation of this
polymer causing the formation of local potential wells where
the polaron is energetically trapped. Upon oxidation, the
polaronic peak is still present, and leads to a fairly asymmetric
tailing across the visible and a slightly blue hue remains
compared to the other polymers. The as cast ﬁlm of DAT-
ProDOT shown in Figure 3b absorbs with a λmax of 491 nm,
thus giving rise to a vibrant orange color. Upon break-in this
polymer exhibits an increase in absorbance along with the
characteristic red-shifting to a λmax of 500 nm leading to a red
colored polymer with no peaks indicating trapped polarons.
Upon oxidation, this polymer’s spectrum is ﬂat across the
visible giving a highly color neutral and transmissive state.
DAT-DMP as a pristine ﬁlm, shown in Figure 3c, absorbs with
a λmax of 466 nm. Upon break-in this spectrum exhibits a
negligible blue-shift in onset with a λmax and observable color
that remained unchanged as a vibrant orange is observed in
both states. Note that this polymer also does not show any
indication of trapped polarons. In the oxidized state this
polymer shows the highest color neutrality with a spectrum
that is ﬂat across the visible region. The as cast ﬁlm of DAT-
DMOT, shown in Figure 3d, has the highest energy λmax of
421 nm and a vibrant yellow color, which was expected due to
the increased inter-ring strain compared to the other polymers.
Upon break-in the red-shift caused by relief of ring strain can
be observed with the color shifting to an orange. There is also a
small amount of absorbance between 600 and 1000 nm
indicative of slight polaron trapping. This polaronic absorption
can be seen again in the oxidized state with slight increased
tailing into the visible from the NIR similar to that of DAT-
EDOT, and leading to a slightly blue hued transmissive state.
Colorimetry utilizing the L*a*b* color space, where a*b*
values correlate to the chroma or saturation of a color (note:
−a* and +a* correspond to green and red and −b* and +b*
correspond to blue and yellow, respectively) and L* depicts
the lightness (a value of 0 would be black and 100 would be
white), was used to demonstrate the control over colors in the
neutral states. The a*b* color space results for the polymer
ﬁlms under study are presented graphically in Figure 4. In the
neutral state, after electrochemical break-in, the polymers had
L* values ranging from 60 to 87, a* values ranging from 23 to
68, and b* values ranging from 34 to 62, thus remaining in the
yellow-orange-red color space similar to the color coordinates
for the previous generations’ ECPs also shown in Figure 4.
In the oxidized states, the transmissive forms had L* values
increased to range from 83 to 90, with low a* values ranging from
−5 to −1 and b* values ranging from −8 to −4. As the magni-
tudes of a* and b* increase, the colors become more saturated,
and as one traverses between color points, the hue changes.
In this ﬁgure, the as-cast ﬁlms are represented in this graph
by the encircled points while the rest of the points are
postconditioning. Upon break-in the change in color
coordinates is greatest for DAT-ProDOT and DAT-DMOT
with a increase in a* and decrease in b* indicating a
red-shifting absorbance, while DAT-EDOT and DAT-DMP
do not exhibit this characteristic change in color coordinates.
DAT-EDOT’s color coordinates move toward the origin upon
break-in, showing a drastic decrease in color vibrancy caused
by the apparent polaron trapping seen in the spectroelec-
trochemistry. DAT-DMP’s color coordinates actually show a
slight decrease in a* and increase in b* which can be explained
by the slight blue-shift in the onset of absorbance of the ﬁlm
upon break-in. This is observed as only a small shift in color of
the material upon break-in (remaining orange), which allows
for ease of predicting the polymer’s usefulness in color mixing.
After the initial electrochemical break-in, all of the polymers
lie within the desired yellow−orange−red color space (positive
a* and positive b*), and upon electrochemical oxidation the
color coordinates are shifted close to the origin, indicating
color neutrality. In the neutral state, DAT-EDOT shows the
least saturation of color with an L*a*b* of 65, 24, and 36 but
does reach a highly transmissive oxidized state with an L*a*b*
of 83, −5, −8, further evidence that polaron trapping is the
cause of the loss of contrast as the oxidized state of the material
is still highly transmissive. DAT-DMOT and DAT-DMP both
show similar neutral state color coordinates of 82, 25, 62 and
87, 23, 59, respectively. DAT-DMP does show a slightly more
color neutral and transmissive oxidized state with color coor-
dinates of 90, −2, −4 compared to 85, −1, −7 for DAT-DMOT.
The polymer ﬁlm of DAT-ProDOT has a high a* with color
coordinates at 60, 68, 34, giving rise to its vibrant orange-red
color. This polymer still oxidizes to a highly transmissive and
color neutral state with color coordinates of 86, −4, −8.
The small structural changes allowed for varying inter-ring
steric strain between these polymers and led to small, yet
distinct changes in color. The human eye is sensitive to small
changes in absorption, making this approach to color tuning
advantageous. Increasing inter-ring steric strain causes blue-
shifting absorbance at the cost of increasing oxidation poten-
tial. This trade-oﬀmust be balanced when attempting to
control color and redox activity.

coordinates at increasing applied potentials in 0.1 V steps from neutral
(0 V vs Ag/AgCl) to fully oxidized states (1.0 V for DAT-EDOT, 1.0 V

Measurements were performed in 0.5 M TBAPF6/PC of ﬁlms spray-
cast onto ITO/glass electrodes. The polymer neutral states are furthest
from the origin, and the values track toward the origin as the polymer is
oxidized to the bleached state. The encircled points indicate the a*b*
coordinates of the as-cast/pristine polymer before electrochemical
cycling. The points not connected by lines are the neutral state a*b*

Film Switching Stability. Redox switching stability of
these wide-gap systems has been one of the larger hurdles for
obtaining useable materials, both as vibrant color switching
ECPs and for creating high contrast black to transmissive poly-
mer blends. To this end examining the contrast as a function of
the number of switches gives a platform to compare materials.
To examine the electrochemical redox stability of these poly-
mers, ﬁlms of each were sprayed to 10%T on ITO glass, and
the transmittance at λmax was monitored over the course of
1000 repeated square-wave potential steps for 1000 cycles in
0.5 M TBAPF6/PC electrolyte solution that had been
thoroughly dried and degassed with argon. Figure 5 details the
relationship between optical contrasts of the polymer ﬁlms as a
function of the number of electrochemical switches (the %T at
λmax was monitored over the course of the cycles and can be
found in Figure S4). It should be noted that the experiment
was started after an electrochemical break-in of 10 CV cycles to
monitor the proper peak maxima.
This break-in explains why DAT-EDOT has an initial
contrast of only 53 Δ%T. The polymer shows signs of a large
amount of polaron trapping after the ﬁrst electrochemical
switch, as seen in the spectroelectrochemistry. The ﬁlm only
loses more contrast over the course of the 1000 electrochemi-
cal switches, ultimately dropping below 40 Δ%T. This polymer
shows the most rapid decrease in contrast, which is attributed
to the observations of polaron trapping, which becomes more
pronounced over the course of repeated electrochemical cycl-
ing. The other polymers all show initial contrasts above 60 Δ%T.
DAT-DMOT shows an initial contrast of 64 Δ%T and over the
course of the experiment only sees a slight drop in contrast to
59 Δ%T on the ﬁnal switch. DAT-ProDOT shows an initial
contrast of 65 Δ%T and maintains this contrast over the course
of the experiment with no measurable loss. DAT-DMP shows
an initial contrast of 63 Δ%T, and over the course of the
experiment there is a slight increase in contrast in the ﬁrst few
hundred switches that levels oﬀat 65 Δ%T. This indicates that
there is a larger break-in period required for this polymer to
reach an equilibrium state, but the ﬁlms retain a high contrast
with minimal color change throughout. Especially important
DAT-ProDOT, DAT-DMP, and DAT-DMOT all show signi-
ﬁcant increases in ﬁlm switching stability compared to previous
generations of wide-gap electrochromic polymers, with only
ProDOT2-Ph(OMe)2 showing redox stability for up to 100
switches.
Device Fabrication and Switching Stability. With the
results obtained and discussed above, DAT-DMP was iden-
tiﬁed as the best candidate for further examination when consider-
ing the use of these polymers as the high-energy absorption
component to create black to transmissive switching ﬁlms.51
DAT-EDOT is not as redox stable as the other materials, and
DAT-ProDOT absorbs at too low an energy to serve this
purpose. While both DAT-DMOT and DAT-DMP absorb the
high energy portion of the spectrum, DAT-DMP does not shift
in absorbance after redox cycling, making it the best candidate
for further examination. To further probe the material’s redox
stability, an electrochromic device was fabricated, and
switching stability was tested over 10000 cycles. The device
architecture and charge storage layer’s structure are detailed in
Figure S5. The device construction involves airbrush spraying a
ﬁlm of DAT-DMP from 3 mg/mL toluene solution onto glass/
ITO with dimensions of 5 cm × 6 cm to an absorbance of
1 and using poly(isobutylene) tape to create a double seal around
the polymer active area and around the edge of the slide. On
another glass/ITO slide another ﬁlm of minimally color changing
polymer (MCCP) is air-brush sprayed to the same dimensions
to act as a charge storage layer but with a thickness dictated by
balancing the amount of charge stored by the electrochromic
polymer.52 The MCCP slide is then immersed into 0.5 M
TBAPF6/PC electrolyte solution in a three-electrode cell and
oxidized for 10 s at 0.8 V relative to Ag/AgCl. Both slides are
then brought into a glovebox with an argon atmosphere, and
gel electrolyte (0.5 M TBAPF6 in 5% w/w PMMA in PC) is
drop cast over the active area of the electrochromic polymer.
The slide coated with the MCCP ﬁlm is placed on top and
placed on a hot plate set to 90 °C to allow for the poly-
(isobutylene) sealant to adhere. The device is cooled to room
temperature before removing from the glovebox.
Spectra for each 1000 switches can be found in Figure S6.
There is minimal change in the spectra of the neutral state over
the course of the experiment, indicating the color is not
changing over the course of the cycles. The oxidized state
spectra do show small decreases in transmittance at 380 and
470 nm indicative of charge imbalance in the device and/or
degradation of the MCCP as the decrease in absor-
bance corresponds to absorbance from the DAT-DMP ﬁlm.

tion or imbalance relative to the amount of DAT-DMP, would
cause the DAT-DMP layer to retain absorbance. The dis-
appearance of the peak at 380 nm upon reduction indicates
that the MCCP is not degrading to give rise to this peak. This
peak is likely due to imbalance in the device. Figure 6 details
the evolution of the transmittance at λmax in both the neutral
and oxidized states every 1000 cycles. There is an initial
200 cycles for device equilibration of the MCCP and ECP
charge storages. After this device’s electrochemical condition-

course of 10000 switches, showing a drop in contrast of
4.7 Δ%T. Most noteworthy is that the %T in the colored state

indicating that the polymer electrochrome is redox stable in
the encapsulated device over this cycling range.
■CONCLUSION
Here, we have reported on the structure−property relationships
of wide-gap electrochromic polymers based on repeat units of
electron-rich dioxythiophenes of varying steric bulk in alter-
nation with dioctylthiophene. ECPs were obtained with yellow,
orange, and red neutral states that switch to colorless oxidized
states. The understanding of how small changes in structure
allow control of absorption properties in this color space allows
for a more informed approach to accessing yellow, orange, and
red ECPs with a speciﬁc target hue in mind.
We show that the synthetic eﬀort of incorporating dioctylth-
iophene units in place of the phenylenes improves redox stabilities,
lowers oxidation potentials, and allows for the use of DOTs
without long side chains as comonomers while maintaining a
wide optical gap and solution processability. However, with the
EDOT system, the presence of trapped polarons causes a fast
degradation of the colored state in an electrochemical cell.
Moving to more strained systems allowed for tuning the color
to a more orange hue, while maintaining low oxidation poten-
tials and redox stabilities that last over 1000 switches as a ﬁlm in
electrolyte solution. From this understanding, an absorptive/
transmissive electrochromic device with DAT-DMP was made
to show that there is minimal contrast loss over 10000 switches.
This redox cycling stability is enhanced by 2 orders of magni-
tude in number of cycles than previous generation wide-gap
ECP-based devices. This approach could be adapted to other
systems by incorporating moieties that block potential reactive
sites on the polymer backbone to improve redox stability. The
incorporation of the dioctylthiophenes in place of phenylene
rings improved upon previous designs of high-bandgap ECPs,
bringing the ﬁeld closer to having a full color palette of stable,
high-performance ECPs.
■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Reagents and starting materials were purchased from commercial
sources and used without further puriﬁcation, unless otherwise noted.
THF, toluene, and propylene carbonate were all puriﬁed through a
Bruker or Vacuum Atmospheres solvent puriﬁcation system. The
synthetic procedures for new compounds and polymers as well as the
corresponding NMR spectra can be found in the Supporting
Information. The synthesis and characterization of PProDOT-
Ph(OMe)2 (Mn = 16.6 kDa, Mw = 24.4 kDa, Đ = 1.5), PProDOT-
Ph (Mn = 20.2 kDa, Mw = 34.4 kDa, Đ = 1.7), PAcDOT2-Ph(OMe)2
