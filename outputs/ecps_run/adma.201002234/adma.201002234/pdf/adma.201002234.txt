 Non-emissive electrochromic devices (ECDs), which can be 
operated under a wide range of viewing and lighting conditions, 
are especially attractive in applications that include smart win-
dows, displays, electronic paper and mirrors. [ 1–4 ] Consequently, 
the processability, ﬂ exibility, high optical contrast, rapid redox 
switching and long-term stability of easily oxidized conjugated 
polymers has made them desired materials for various reﬂ ec-
tive/transmissive ECDs. [ 5–7 ] Although many polymeric elec-
trochromes which are colored (red and orange, [ 8 ] green, [ 9–11 ] 
magenta/purple, [ 12 ] and blue [ 13–17 ] ) in the neutral state and 
highly transmissive in the oxidized state have been investi-
gated, there are only two black-to-transmissive electrochromic 
polymers (ECPs) reported to date. [ 18 , 19 ] This is due to the com-
plexity in inducing a polymer absorption spectrum which 
absorbs evenly over the entire visible spectrum (400–750 nm) 
in the fully neutralized state, while effectively bleaching out in 
the same region in the fully oxidized state. 
 In order to create conjugated polymers with neutral state 
colors of blue, green or black, the materials’ optically estimated 
band gap must be lower than 1.75 eV. The “donor-acceptor” 
(DA) [ 20–22 ]  approach has successfully been utilized to achieve 
these low-gap polymers for organic photovoltaics, [ 23–26 ] ﬁ eld-
effect transistors [ 27 , 28 ] and light emitting diodes. [ 29 ] DA type 
polymers generally show two distinct optical absorption bands, 
which can be modulated as a function of the composition of 
donor and acceptor moieties in the main chain. [ 30–32 ] The tuning 
of the dual-band absorption character of DA type polymers pro-
vides an elegant method of modifying spectral characteristics to 
achieve desired colors. 
 In recent work, we reported the synthesis and characteriza-
tion of the ﬁ rst black-to-transmissive switching polymeric elec-
trochrome based on the donor-acceptor approach. [ 18 ] We showed 
that by variation of the relative contribution of electron-rich and 
-poor moieties in the polymer backbone, the two-band absorp-
tion in the visible spectrum could be controlled. In addition, 
using a particular feed ratio of two different monomers, the dis-
crete absorption bands merged into a broad absorption across 
the entire visible spectrum. The spray-cast polymer thin ﬁ lm 
exhibited a deep black neutral state and attained a highly trans-
missive state when fully oxidized. Due to the synthetic com-
plexity of the polymer, which involved the synthesis and chro-
matographic separation of DAD trimers, and which may limit 
reproducible large-scale production of the material, we desired 
to develop a method that would lead to polymer batches with 
highly reproducible absorption spectra and an efﬁ cient, scalable 
and consistent polymerization process. 
 As illustrated by  Figure  1a , we demonstrate a facile syn-
thetic approach to access black-to-transmissive electrochromic 
polymers via a random transition-metal mediated coupling 
poly merization. In the speciﬁ c instance reported here, we use 
a Stille polymerization; however the method could be applied 
to many other transition-metal mediated reactions that include 
Suzuki, Negishi, and Kumada couplings. Under the most 
common Stille polymerization conditions, two monomers (typi-
cally an aryl distannane and an aryl dihalide) are cross-coupled 
using palladium catalysis to produce polymers with pre-deter-
mined Ar-Ar ′ couplings. [ 33–35 ] In this approach, we desired to 
incorporate a random mixture of donor and acceptor heterocy-
cles in order achieve a black polymer by utilizing more than 
two monomeric species in the polymerizations. [ 36 , 37 ] In order 
to simulate the ratio of electron-rich to electron-poor heterocy-
cles determined in our previous work, we chose to randomly 
polymerize both 2,5-dibromo- and 2,5-tributylstannyl-2-ethyl-
hexyloxy-substituted 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT-
(CH 2 OEtHx) 2 ) with 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD) 
in different feed ratios. In an optimization of the feed ratio, ﬁ ve 
random broadly absorbing copolymers ( ECP-1 through  ECP-5 ) 
were produced, with number average molecular weights (M n ) 
around 10 to 15 kDa and polydispersities ranging from 1.3 to 
1.6 after fractionation (see Supporting Information, Table S1). 
 The UV-visible absorption spectra of the polymers in chlo-
roform are shown in Figure  1 b. A broad spectral absorption 
is evident ranging from approximately 400 nm to greater than 
700 nm for each polymer. Unlike the spectra of typical donor-
acceptor polymers, which generally have two distinct absorp-
tion bands, the spectra of polymers  ECP-1  to  ECP-5 show a 
“merging” of the short- and long-wavelength optical transitions, 
and no obvious peak to peak window is observed. As expected, 
 ECP-1 exhibits the lowest intensity of the short-wavelength 
absorption at 461 nm due to its relatively low concentration of 
electron-rich moiety. Considering the reduced absorption of 
blue and green light (400–580 nm), as well as an absence of far-
red light absorption from 700 to 750 nm, it is reasonable that 
the solution of  ECP-1 gives a midnight blue color. By increasing 
the relative amount of ProDOT-(CH 2 OEtHx) 2 repeat unit, the

the spectra in the solid state compared to solutions for all ﬁ ve 
polymers. The signiﬁ cant extension of absorption into the far 
red region is important as it leads to a more pure black color of 
the ﬁ lms. As determined from the onset of their neutral-state 
lower-energy optical transition, the polymers give a relatively 
low band gap ranging from 1.6–1.7 eV. 
 Figure  2a shows the full spectroelectrochemical behavior 
of an  ECP-3 ﬁ lm. The ﬁ lm was redox cycled to a stable and 
reproducible switch prior to the analysis, and then elec-
trochemically oxidized from  − 0.25 to  + 0.35 V vs. Fc/Fc  +  (in 
25 mV steps). Upon oxidization of the polymer, the broad 
absorption in the visible region is depleted, and a polaronic 
transition in the near-IR (800–1200 nm) arises, and then 
falls as a bipolaronic transition further in the NIR appears. 
When fully oxidized, the generated bipolaronic absorption 
peaks beyond 1600 nm, which allows effective bleaching of 
the visible absorption, and a remarkably high level of trans-
missivity to the human eye. In order to further accentuate the 
optical changes that occur upon oxidation, the electrochromic 
response is shown in terms of transmissivity across just the 
visible region in Figure  2 b from 350 nm to 750 nm. For a ﬁ lm 
of  ECP-3 in its neutral state, a nearly ﬂ at transmittance proﬁ le 
at 20% from 450 nm to 700 nm is observed. In contrast, when 
the ﬁ lm is fully oxidized, the transmittance increases to above 
60% through most of the visible region. The electrochromic 
contrast (as percent transmittance change,  Δ % T ) is as high as 
difference in intensity between the two absorption bands is 
reduced. At a speciﬁ c point where the donor/acceptor ratio is 
approximately 7 to 1, the intensities of the two bands are bal-
anced, and homogenous absorptions across most of the visible 
spectrum (450–650 nm) are observed for  ECP-3 and  ECP-4 . Not 
surprisingly, solutions of  ECP-3 and  ECP-4 show a similar dark-
purple-black color due to the lack of absorption in the far blue 
and red regions. Accordingly, the absorption of  ECP-5 shows 
a higher intensity of the high energy transition (530 nm) than 
its low energy transition (572 nm) with a further increase of 
the donor concentration, and the solution of  ECP-5 exhibits a 
bright purple color due to the increased reﬂ ection/transmission 
of red light. 
 Two additional syntheses of polymer  ECP-3  were under 
taken to demonstrate successful repeatability. The generated 
polymers  ECP-3-s1  and  ECP-3-s2 are consistent with  ECP-3 
in terms of molecular weight (M n ), PDI and solution absorp-
tion (see Supporting Information, Table S1 and Figure S1). As 
expected, by controlling the feed ratio of the monomers, we 
were able to effectively manipulate the absorption pattern of 
the polymers. 
 Thin ﬁ lms of each polymer were then spray-cast onto 
indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slides from toluene solu-
tion (2 mg mL  − 1 ). The visible absorption spectra of the ﬁ lms 
shown in Figure  1 c exhibit a broadening of the long wavelength 
absorption with little to no change at the higher energy end of

with the visible absorption spectra of  ECP-3 thin ﬁ lm as a small 
amount of red and slightly more blue light is transmitted by 
the polymer. In comparison, the fully oxidized polymer ﬁ lms 
exhibit high  L  ∗  values from 82 to 92 with smaller  a  ∗  and  b  ∗  
values, which demonstrates that this polymer is able to reach a 
highly transmissive near colorless state as deﬁ ned by the  L  ∗  a  ∗  b  ∗  
color coordinates. 
 Given that the speed at which electrochromic materials 
change color states is important in display-type devices, the 
ﬁ lm switching rate was examined by monitoring the transmit-
tance change at a single wavelength (EC contrast,  Δ % T ) as a 
function of time by applying square-wave potential steps for 
periods of 10, 2 and 1 s. As shown in Figure  2 d, a transmittance 
change (monitored at 540 nm) as high as 47% is recorded at 
the longer switch time (10 s), and decreasing the switch time to 
48% at 555 nm, the wavelength at which the human eye has 
greatest sensitivity.  
 To evaluate the color changes of the ECPs occurring on elec-
trochemical switching (on the basis of the “Commission Inter-
nationale de l’Eclairage” 1976  L  ∗  a  ∗  b  ∗  color standards), three 
 ECP-3 ﬁ lms with varying thicknesses were subjected to colori-
metric analysis. Figure  2 c shows the determined CIE 1976  L  ∗  
values as a function of applied voltage that gives an indication 
of relative brightness of the ﬁ lm as it is oxidized while illumi-
nated from behind (transmission mode) with a standard D50 
simulated daytime light source. In their neutral state, the 
poly mer ﬁ lms exhibit  L  ∗  values from 46 for the thickest ﬁ lm to 
75 for the thinnest ﬁ lm. Importantly, the ﬁ lm with absorption 
maximum of 1.1 a.u. displays a deep black color with  a  ∗  and 
 b  ∗  values as low as 3 and  − 11. This observation is consistent

was shown to be highly repeatable between different runs. The

1 s, is reduced to 42%, only a 5% loss. As stability to repeated 
redox switching is also essential to the practical utilization of 
these materials in EC devices, the EC contrast ( Δ % T at 540 nm) 
of a ﬁ lm was monitored while repeated square-wave potential 
steps of 1.5 s (complete cycle is 3 s, switching between  − 0.72 to 
 + 0.48 V vs. Fc/Fc  +  ) for 18,000 cycles (Figure S2) were applied. 
The polymer exhibits a continuous switching stability with 
only a decrease of 8% in electrochromic contrast over this time 
period. 
 To further reinforce the utility of these polymers, we have 
demonstrated black-to-transmissive switching in an absorptive/
transmissive window-type electrochromic device. Using the 
device structure as detailed in Figure S3, the polymer  ECP-3 
was utilized as the actively switching material at the working 
electrode, and a minimally color-changing polymer (N-alkyl 
substituted poly(3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole)), which is similar 
to that previously described by our group, [ 38 ] was used as the 
charge-balancing material at the counter electrode. As shown in 
 Figure  3 , the transmittance spectra of the device in both the dark 
state and transmissive state were measured across the visible 
region from 400 to 750 nm. Higher transmittance in the blue 
region is observed when the polymer is in the oxidized state 
giving a highly transmissive light blue color. Conversely, when 
the polymer is neutralized at a device cell potential of  − 0.6 V, 
the transmittance decreases to a near featureless spectral proﬁ le 
with the device having a contrast of  ∼ 40% at 555 nm. Addition-
ally, an absorptive/reﬂ ective display-type device was constructed 
utilizing polymer  ECP-3 as the active electrochrome as detailed 
in the Supporting Information. 
 In conclusion, precise control of the absorption spectra of 
conjugated polymers was achieved by simply varying monomer 
feed ratios in a random Stille polymerization. This approach 
produced black-to-transmissive polymer electrochromes with 
the most broad and uniform visible absorption that have been
