Tuning the painter’s palette: subtle steric eﬀects
on spectra and colour in conjugated
electrochromic polymers†

A series of vibrantly coloured p-conjugated electrochromic polymers (ECPs) were designed and
synthesized with the goal of extracting structure–property relationships from subtle changes in steric strain
or relaxation. These are soluble all donor, electron rich, alternating polymers based on repeat units of 3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT), and an acyclic dioxythiophene
(AcDOT) in varying combinations to tune steric interactions and the subsequent optical absorption for
fine colour control. Two families of polymers were formed where ProDOT2–EDOT, ProDOT–EDOT, and
ProDOT2–EDOT2 constitute new shades of blues while AcDOT2–ProDOT, AcDOT–ProDOT, and
AcDOT–EDOT yield new hues of magentas with the homopolymers of ProDOT and AcDOT and the
copolymer AcDOT2–EDOT2 serving as comparisons. The polymers were synthesized using direct (hetero)-
arylation polymerization. Examinations of the optoelectronic properties via cyclic voltammetry, spectro-
electrochemistry, and colorimetry show that by subtly varying the level of steric relaxation or strain in the
form of EDOT or AcDOT content, lower or higher energy absorption transitions are produced respectively.
This increase in relaxation or strain allows more short or long wavelength light to transmit, giving new
shades of blues or magentas respectively. Since these are all donating polymers, they exhibit changes in
contrast no less than 70% at the lmax with the exception of AcDOT–EDOT. The most desirable electro-
chromic properties were achieved with ProDOT2–EDOT2 and AcDOT2–ProDOT, with band gaps (Eg) and
neutral state L*a*b* colour values (a* and +a* correspond to green and red and b* and +b* corre-
spond to blue and yellow respectively and L* represents the lightness) of 1.74 eV, 37, 12, 63 and 2.01 eV,
56, 59, 16 respectively. The highly transmissive oxidized state colour values for ProDOT2–EDOT2 and
AcDOT2–ProDOT are 92, 3, 3 and 91, 2, 1 respectively. These structure–property relationships grant
a greater ability to tune light absorption across the visible, with colour properties similar to ECPs made
through other methods without using donor–acceptor effects. This all donor steric tuning method leads
to considerably higher levels of transparency when the polymers are fully oxidized.
Introduction
When comparing electrochromic materials derived from metal
oxides1 with molecular organic2–4 and polymeric5 electrochromes,
the latter stand out for the broad array of colours that can switch to
highly transmissive states. Due to their solubility allowing

fully
conjugated
electrochromic polymers (ECPs) provide a full palette of colours
from which to develop devices. These polymers all attain highly
transmissive states, high electrochromic contrast, rapid (sub-
second) switching and long cycle lives (410000). These material
properties have allowed ECPs to be incorporated into display and
window type devices (ECDs) with potential commercial viability.
Numerous techniques have been employed to control the
visible absorption and colour of the neutral state in ECPs. These
range from utilizing donor–acceptor (D–A) effects, vinylene and
azomethine14 linkers, the interchange of atoms that constitute
heterocycles or reside on the b positions, the variation of comono-
mer feed ratios or the nature of pendant groups,5 and varying the
design of the metal–ligand in metallo-supramolecular polymers.15–18
The D–A method has proven especially useful as the donor
moiety positions the HOMO while the acceptor positions the

LUMO, retaining low oxidation potentials required for long
term redox switching.19–21
Examining the spectra for the transmissive oxidized states of
these D–A ECPs shows tailing of charge carrier absorption in the
near infrared back into the visible, giving some residual visible
absorption and inducing a blue tint in the films. This effect
is evident in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)22 and some-
what minimalised in poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (ProDOT)23
ECPs with long and bulky substituents. By retaining the highly
electron rich nature of the XDOT polymers (where X represents
ethylene, propylene, butylene, etc.), we hypothesize that steric con-
trol can be the sole ‘‘handle’’ for tuning colour while maintaining
outstanding electrochromic switching to highly transmissive states.
This is exemplified in the literature by the use of an acyclic
dioxythiophene (AcDOT) in developing orange and red-coloured
ECPs.24
Here, we report a family of EDOT, ProDOT, and AcDOT
copolymers, each having regular nonrandom repeat units, and
all prepared by direct arylation polymerisation (DAP) where
neutral colours can be varied from bright pink, to magenta,
purple, periwinkle, and blue solely by steric control. We find
these polymers to switch rapidly and reproducibly to highly
transmissive oxidised states that are more transmissive and less
coloured than previously reported polymers. These ECPs explore
the eﬀects of subtle relaxation and torsional strain on spectra for
colour control and allow us to address the issue of colour break-in
by comparing as-sprayed films to those that have been electro-
chemically cycled as steric hindrance eliminates the break-in
eﬀect making for improved colour consistency.
As illustrated by Scheme 1, steric interactions can be viewed
as inducing torsional strain and relaxation along a conjugated
polymer backbone, controlling pi-overlap. When AcDOT units
neighbor another AcDOT, strain induces conformational twist-
ing. This breaks conjugation and leads to shorter wavelength
absorption. As torsional strain is relaxed through the incorpora-
tion of ProDOT or EDOT, planarity is induced, conjugation is
extended, and longer wavelengths of light are absorbed.
Results and discussion
1.
Polymer synthesis
All polymers were prepared using optimized DAP25,26 from six
diﬀerent monomeric and dimeric XDOTs, as shown in the ESI,†
to yield ECPs with repeat unit structures shown in Scheme 2.
With recent developments reviewed by Leclerc et al.,27 DAP was
chosen as it allows access to the desired electron rich polymer
structures without the need to synthesize and purify organotin
monomers while maintaining an alternating repeat unit that
is not accessible via oxidative methods. Characterization by

1H-NMR and comparative GPC demonstrates all polymers to
be correctly structured and of suﬃcient molecular weight
(Mn ranging from 14 kDa to 176 kDa) to produce continuous
films where the optical properties are in the polymer limit. A
collection of polymerization yields and molecular weights is
given in Table 1. All of the polymers were isolated in high yield
(460%) with the exception of ProDOT–EDOT as it was difficult
to solubilize. The solubility of the polymers that are composed
of EDOTs is relatively low (ca. o2 mg mL1) but sufficient enough
to conduct spray casting of solutions at room temperature.
2.
Optoelectronic properties
Electrochemistry and break-in. Solutions of the polymers
were prepared at a concentration of 5 mg mL1 in chloroform
and then spray cast onto ITO glass at 10 psi yielding films of
varying thickness based on optical density (from 0.8 a.u. to
1.2 a.u.) which was then correlated to a physical thickness as
measured and averaged by profilometry (see ESI,† Table S1).
The polymers are divided into two families: the blue hues
(comprised of ProDOT–EDOT, ProDOT2–EDOT, and ProDOT2–
EDOT2) and the magenta hues (comprised of AcDOT–ProDOT,
AcDOT2–ProDOT, and AcDOT–EDOT) while AcDOT2–EDOT2,
ProDOT, and AcDOT (purple and orange hues respectively) stand
as comparison structures between the two families. These families
of blue and magenta ECPs were developed with the goal of
examining the effects of subtle relaxation and torsional strain
on spectra to explore colour control.
Prior to spectroelectrochemistry, the films were electro-
chemically conditioned (so called ‘‘broken in’’) with 25 cycles
via cyclic voltammetry (CV) to the point where the current
stabilized to become reproducible. As noted from Fig. S2 (ESI†)
there is a considerable change between the first and second cycle,
after which the current minimally decreases and is fully reproduc-
ible in all cases by the 25th cycle. All of the polymers oxidize
easily and, as shown by diﬀerential pulse voltammetry (DPV), the
onsets for the oxidation potentials range from 490 to 206 mV.
AcDOT (ECP-orange) is an exception and has an oxidation
potential of 260 mV, attributed to pendant group bulkiness.24
The induction of steric relaxation along the conjugated back-
bone via the alternating addition of EDOT moieties and mono-
mer repeats having large and bulky solubilizing substituents
presents drastic changes between the pristine and broken-in
film states. As strain is introduced through AcDOT incorpora-
tion, this eﬀect is mitigated with a minimal change between
the pristine and broken in state exhibited by AcDOT2–ProDOT
(Fig. S2e, ESI†). Examining the differential pulse voltammetry
results in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the increase in strain raises oxidation
potential onsets while relaxation lowers it.
Optical properties. The break-in eﬀect observed results in
an alteration of the film spectra after switching as exemplified in
Fig. S4 (ESI†). In concert with the changes observed by CV, the film
spectra redshift and increase in optical density as relaxation is
induced, while the changes in the spectra are reduced with increas-
ing strain. This is exemplified with AcDOT2–ProDOT where there is
no spectral difference between the pristine and broken in state,
which can be correlated to a minimal change during CV. To
examine the optical properties of the broken-in films, the normal-
ized neutral state absorption spectra for the two families of the all
donor polymers are shown in Fig. 1 with the absorption onsets and
lmax values reported in Table 1. Examining Fig. 1a, as strain is
decreased (relaxation) through increased EDOT content, long
wavelength absorption, relative to the ProDOT and AcDOT
homopolymers, is increased. All of the copolymers possess
considerably lower band gaps relative to ProDOT allowing the

absorption of long wavelength light, making the materials
appear periwinkle-blue to the eye. With this red-shifted absorp-
tion onsetting around 700–750 nm, these polymers can be
thought of as organic soluble analogues of PEDOT. Turning
attention to Fig. 1b, as steric hindrance is increased via AcDOT
addition, shorter wavelength absorption is induced relative to
ProDOT. These materials with greater strain absorb more of the
high energy portion of the visible spectrum, reducing the
amount of blue light that reaches the eye, making the materials
appear as ‘‘reddened’’ or ‘‘hotter’’ magentas and pinks.
The repeat unit structure has an overall eﬀect on the presence,
or lack thereof, of vibronic coupling in the spectra. Increasing the
amount of strain via shifting from AcDOT–ProDOT to AcDOT2–
ProDOT only showed a slight decrease in the degree of vibronic
coupling, as evidenced by the lower definition in the multiple
peaks, relative to ProDOT which exhibits a high degree of
order.22,28–30 Following this, there is a decrease in the extent of
vibronic coupling observed for the EDOT containing polymers.
This indicates that, although AcDOT is considerably bulkier than
EDOT, the low steric hindrance of the latter allows the propylene
bridge on neighboring ProDOT rings to have more freedom in
conformational changes, inducing greater degrees of disorder in
the polymer backbone, thereby reducing the extent of vibronic
coupling and broadening the spectra.31–33
3.
Spectroelectrochemistry
These all-donor polymers exhibit a high electrochromic contrast,
switching from a vibrant coloured state to highly transmissive, as
illustrated in Fig. 2 for ProDOT2–EDOT2 and AcDOT2–ProDOT,
along with the remaining polymers in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The entire
family of materials studied exhibit changes in contrast above
60% at lmax as shown in Table 2. ProDOT2–EDOT2 and AcDOT2–
ProDOT exhibit the highest contrast values, 75 and 73 D%T at
lmax respectively, and the least residual absorption in the visible
from the fully oxidized transmissive state, even for thicker films.
Those that incorporate EDOT have a broadened potential range
over which the polymer switches with subtle changes over the
duration of oxidation while those that utilize AcDOT have a
narrowing of the potential window with larger changes upon
each potential step. As presented by the Leclerc group, this
phenomena has been attributed to twiston effects, which are
in essence delocalized conformational defects, seen in previous
polymer systems.24,34,35 Because of the high twist (less planarity)
induced in AcDOT–ProDOT and AcDOT2–ProDOT, there is a resis-
tance to planarization on initial oxidation. However, at increasing
oxidation steps, localized planarization begins to occur, which has a
rapid propagation along neighboring repeat units.
Upon examination of the switching kinetics via chrono-
absorptometry in Fig. S6 (ESI†), all of the polymers synthesized
for this study are shown to undergo their full neutral coloured
to oxidized transmissive change with switch times as fast as
1 second showing minimal loss in contrast. Upon switching at
fast speeds of 1
2 and 1
4 second cycles, the polymers exhibit an
expected loss in contrast due to diﬀusion limiting processes of
electrolyte migration. After cycling at high speeds, the polymers
are all capable of regaining high levels of contrast with no
apparent negative eﬀects (delaminating, blistering, etc.), demon-
strating robustness during rapid changes in switching speeds.

ECPs with increasing relaxation progressing from orange,
through purple, to blue a*b* values are as follows:
AcDOT (42, 53) - ProDOT (51, 37) -
AcDOT2–EDOT2 (38, 44) - ProDOT2–EDOT (32, 63) -
ProDOT–EDOT (16, 43) - ProDOT2–EDOT2 (12, 63)
Referring to the neutral state spectra in Fig. 1a, as long
wavelength absorption transitions are induced through relaxa-
tion from the increased content of EDOT, colour values in the
neutral state progress to lower a*, indicating less purple colour
and more blue hue. This is due to the progressive transmission
or passing of more blue and less red light. The colour trend for
the magenta hued ECPs with increasing strain progressing
from purple, through pink, to orange a*b* values are as follows:
AcDOT2–EDOT2 (38, 44) - AcDOT–EDOT (41, 35) -
ProDOT (51, 37) - AcDOT–ProDOT (70, 36) -
AcDOT2–ProDOT (59, 16) - AcDOT (42, 53)
Again, connecting to the neutral state spectra in Fig. 1b, as
moderate and short wavelength light absorption is induced
through the increase in strain from the addition of AcDOT, colour
values in the neutral state progress to higher b*, decreasing

‘‘purpleness’’ and yielding truer magenta and pink colours due to
more absorption of blue light and increasing transmission or
passing of red light. Importantly, AcDOT2–ProDOT nearly matches
the colour values of a standard magenta as defined by Munsell
(L*, a*, b* = 52, 50, 15)36 whereas ProDOT is a bit too ‘‘purple’’
after break-in. This will allow for more accurate colour mixing in
the cyan-magenta-yellow (CMY) subtractive regime using these
soluble polymers.37 Complete colorimetry and arrays of photo-
graphs for each polymer at a variety of thicknesses can be found
in Fig. S7 (ESI†).
The minimal hue and saturation of colour in the oxidized
form for all of these polymers comes from their ability to
exhibit minimal residual absorption in the visible spectrum
because of their electron rich, all-donating character, as shown
by Fig. 4a and Fig. S8 (ESI†). The L* for all of the polymers as a
function of voltage during switching can be seen in Fig. 4b.
Upon oxidation all values of lightness are high.
5.
Comparing all-donor and donor–acceptor systems
Through relaxation, the subtle steric tuning in all donor poly-
mers can yield materials with low band gaps (ProDOT2–EDOT2)
that are blue in the neutral state with colour values that are
comparable to those of a blue-to-transmissive ECP designed by
donor–acceptor (D–A) methods.20 A comparison between the
neutral states for ProDOT2–EDOT2 and the previously reported
ECP-blue (ProDOT–BTD) is presented in Fig. 5a. This compar-
ison was chosen as the two materials possess similar colour
values while employing distinctly different structures to tune
optical transitions. From Fig. 5a it can be seen that using a D–A
approach between alternating ProDOT and BTD (benzothiadia-
zole) a dual band absorption results where the shorter wave-
length absorption is attributed to the p to p* and the longer
wavelength absorption is from the donor–acceptor charge
transfer interactions.21 Using the method of steric relaxation
in ProDOT2–EDOT2, an absorption was attained with an onset
at shorter wavelengths (1.74 eV), remaining at the edge of the
visible spectrum. Through the D–A approach, a much lower
onset was achieved (1.53 eV) with a window of transmission at
431 nm between the two bands. The two different absorption
spectra give two unique neutral state colours. As shown earlier,
ProDOT2–EDOT2 allows a majority of blue light, and a minimal
amount of red light, to transmit, giving a saturated blue colour.
With ECP-blue, its more redshifted onset from the CT absorp-
tion allows more green than red light to transmit however, the
higher energy p to p* filters out blue and violet light, making it
a less saturated sky-blue colour. Though they have similar
numerical colour values, ProDOT2–EDOT2 appears more satu-
rated in colour because more blue light is reaching the highly
sensitive S cones in the human eye.
The electron rich character of the all donor polymers devel-
oped here allow them to be fully bleached (oxidized to a point
where a*b* colour values approach zero and L* is high) at
potentials that are lower than those exhibited by donor–acceptor
systems. In the oxidized transmissive states, for the all donor
polymer (ProDOT2–EDOT2), the p-electron donating character of
the oxygens residing on the b-position of thiophene impart
stabilization to the oxidized form, red-shifting the overall absorp-
tion (see Fig. 5a) and leading to a repression of the absorption
between 700–1000 nm relative to the donor–acceptor system
(ECP-blue). The ability for S and O to interact between neigh-
boring dioxythiophene units and induce planarization may also
assist in this redshift.32,33 In Fig. 5a it can be seen that when
ECP-blue is fully oxidized to the transmissive state there is
a significant absorption tailing into the long wavelength portion
of the visible (600–720 nm) with a peak in the NIR at B1460 nm,
showing a blue tint when oxidized (Fig. 5c) while ProDOT2–
EDOT2 exhibits minimal tailing in the same portion with a peak
beyond 1600 nm, being nearly colourless when oxidized.
From the comparisons presented in Fig. 5, one can see that
lower gaps can be attained with donor–acceptor effects, but at
the cost of electrochromic contrast as a consequence of tailing
absorption due to the incorporation of electron deficient acceptors.
All donor systems would require significant synthetic design of
new relaxed rings to achieve comparably low gaps, but as the state

of the art stands with DOTs, the attainable gaps are sufficient for
colour applications with high electrochromic contrast from all
donor structures nearly eliminating residual visible absorption
when fully oxidized.
For improved visualization of the enhanced properties of the
all donor systems, Fig. 6 shows a patterned film comparing
several of the all donor polymers examined here (ProDOT2–EDOT2,
ProDOT, AcDOT2–ProDOT, and AcDOT) side by side with the
donor–acceptor ProDOT–BTD. It is evident that each of the poly-
mers, save for ProDOT–BTD, switch to the bleached state in a
similar voltage window, as desired for simultaneously colouring-
bleaching displays. The ProDOT–BTD remains coloured until
higher voltages are applied due to its higher oxidation potential.
Also it is worth noting in Fig. 6, the polymer that makes up the
stem and leaves of the flower, is also a donor acceptor system,
ProDOT4–BTD (structure shown in Fig. S9, ESI†); however, it
qualitatively shows behavior that is comparable with the all donor
systems. This can be explained by the fact that it has significantly
more donor character than acceptor, containing four times the
donor amount of ProDOT–BTD.

Conclusions
Through modulating the strain along the backbone of all
donating dioxythiophene ECPs the colour of the neutral state
was controlled, making new, desired shades of blues and
magentas with high electrochromic contrast. Blue hues (low
band gaps) could be attained by utilizing relaxation in the form
of EDOT content while magenta hues (mid gaps) could be
acquired through increasing steric hindrance with AcDOT. This
steric approach was used to achieve a polymer with a magenta
neutral state as defined by Munsell, allowing more accurate
subtractive CMY colour mixing. These polymers exhibit signifi-
cant changes in spectra between the pristine and electrochemi-
cally broken-in neutral state, which can be minimized through
increased steric strain. Compared to the donor–acceptor method
of colour control, sterically tuned all donors can achieve similar
vibrantly coloured neutral states but with the advantage of
greater contrast when oxidized. Based on this revelation it would
be advantageous to minimize the use of donor–acceptor archi-
tectures in ECPs where possible or to develop new acceptors that
would minimize the tailing from fully oxidized states.
