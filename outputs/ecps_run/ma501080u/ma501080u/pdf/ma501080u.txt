ABSTRACT: A series of conjugated polymers were designed and synthesized to
extract structure−property relationships with the goal of yielding yellow-to-
transmissive switching electrochromes. The polymers are based on repeat units
of propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) in alternation with a variety of arylenes
including 1,4-phenylene (ProDOT-Ph), 2,7-ﬂuorene (ProDOT-Fl), 2,7-
carbazole (ProDOT-Cbz), 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene (ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2),
and 2,7-pyrene (ProDOT-Py). Additionally, a random copolymer containing
ProDOT and two diﬀerent arylene units was produced: ProDOT-phenylene-
ProDOT-dimethoxyphenylene (R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2) and two polymers with a ProDOT dimer in alternation with pyrene
and phenylene composed ProDOT2-pyrene (ProDOT2-Py) and ProDOT2-phenylene (ProDOT2-Ph), respectively. The
polymers were synthesized using Suzuki polycondensation. Examinations of the optoelectronic properties via UV−vis−NIR
spectroscopy, diﬀerential pulse voltammetry, and spectroelectrochemistry show that varying the electron richness of the polymer
by utilizing more electron rich arylenes, dimers of ProDOT, or less electron rich arylenes, the oxidation potential could be
decreased or increased, respectively, ranging from 270 to 650 mV. Through subtle C−H ortho interactions from the arylene unit,
yellow neutral state colors were maintained with transmissive or near-transmissive oxidized states. Colorimetry utilizing L*a*b*,
where a*b* values correlate to the chroma or saturation of a color (note: −a* and +a* correspond to green and red and −b* and
+b* correspond to blue and yellow, respectively) and L* represents the lightness, was used to show the maintenance of yellow
colors in the neutral states. Herein, the yellow polymers had L* values above 84.0, a* values ranging from −11.6 to 24.8, and b*
values greater than 47.6. In the oxidized states, the most transmissive forms had L* values above 70.0, a* values ranging from
−2.1 to 2.0, and b* values ranging from −6.8 to −0.1. These structure−property relationships grant access to conjugated
polymers with high energy absorbance in the visible, while allowing variability in redox potentials, providing a deeper
understanding in yielding yellow-to-transmissive electrochromic polymers.
■INTRODUCTION
The electrochromism of inorganic, organic small molecule, and
polymeric based materials has demonstrated the possibility of
wide and lucrative applications ranging from displays,1,2 smart
windows,3,4 E-paper,5 and E-cloth6 to dual use emissive/
nonemissive systems.7 Of the materials listed, conjugated
polymers hold signiﬁcant promise as recent advances have
demonstrated that they have straightforward synthesis and
color tuning,8−10 coupled with potentially low cost process-
ability.11,12 The solubility of electrochromic polymers (ECPs)
allows for high throughput methods such as spray casting and
slot-die coating for large area roll-to-roll processing from
aqueous13 or organic solutions12 for both display and window
applicationsnecessary for large scale printing and patterning
of EC devices.
Our group has focused eﬀorts toward utilizing cathodically
coloring polymers that possess vibrantly colored neutral and
transmissive oxidized states.9 Polymers that switch from a
colored state to a fully transmissive state are required for
applications in window and display technologies where
multicolor polymers are not appropriate or desired. Our recent
report of the electrochromic polymer ECP-Yellow (herein
referred to as ProDOT-Ph for structural comparison with other
polymers to be reported) has allowed the completion of a full
color palette of solution processable ECPs9,14 and demon-
strated the importance of obtaining a vibrant yellow-to-
transmissive electrochrome as this fulﬁlls both of the subtractive
primary color sets: cyan−magenta−yellow (CMY) and red−
yellow−blue (RYB). Through the use of subtractive color
mixing, a wide variety of hues can be obtained for use in full
color displays.15,16 Although our published yellow ECP is the
only solution-processable cathodically coloring, yellow-to-
transmissive ECP reported to date to our knowledge, it
switches at an oxidation potential that is relatively high
compared to many of the other electron-rich ECPs we employ.
This complicates the use of multiple ECPs on the same

electrode as overoxidation of more easily oxidized polymers can
occur when applying the high potential required to switch
ProDOT-Ph to the fully transparent state. This observation,
along with recent reports of several electrochromic poly-
mers17−21 and small molecule esters22−24 that possess yellow
states, has motivated a detailed study in developing an
understanding of structure−property relationships in a series
of ProDOT−arylene conjugated polymers with the aim toward
lowering the oxidation potential, allowing a higher level of
transparency in the bleached state, while maintaining a vibrant
yellow neutral state.
Through varying the choice of an arylene unit in alternation
with ProDOT, dimers of ProDOT, or using a random
copolymer with ProDOT, we are able to structurally modulate
the oxidation potential of seven new ECPs while maintaining
yellow or near yellow neutral states that can switch to various
transmissive or near transmissive oxidized states. These
methods yield insight for the future development of materials
with high-energy absorption in the visible region and to vary
the electrochemical potentials.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Polymer Synthesis. The repeat unit structures for the
polymers synthesized in this eﬀort are shown in Scheme 1. The
synthetic details for the preparation of each monomer are given
in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1). All of the
monomers used were straightforward to produce and are
highly scalable from available starting materials. Boronate
monomers can generally be produced in high yield using
Miyaura borylation or lithium halogen exchange, often with
recrystallization as the only puriﬁcation step. Additionally,
recent advances in iridium catalyzed borylation allowed us to
access the 2,7-bisborylated pyrene eﬃciently.25 Suzuki poly-
condensation under optimized conditions was chosen as the
method to synthesize the polymers as boronic esters are
generally environmentally benign.26
The Suzuki condensation reactions aﬀorded polymers with
molecular weights over 10 kDa (measured by GPC vs
polystyrene standards, THF eluent) after initial precipitation
into methanol, with the exception of ProDOT-Py and
ProDOT2-Py as these polymers were no longer soluble in
toluene as the Suzuki reaction progressed. Polymer puriﬁcation
was conducted via Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone,
and hexane, followed by dissolution with chloroform. ProDOT-
Py and ProDOT2-Py were removed from the Soxhlet thimble
by washing with near boiling o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The
ﬁnal polymer solutions were concentrated and stirred at 50 °C
for 6 h with 200 mg of diethylammonium diethyldithiocarba-
mate palladium scavenger27 dissolved in solution. The solution
was then cooled and precipitated into methanol, ﬁltered over a
0.45 μm nylon pad, washed with methanol, collected, and dried
under vacuum.
A comparison between the yields and molecular weights
(GPC vs polystyrene) is shown in Table 1, and all GPC traces
are shown in Figure S1. A majority of the polymers were
soluble in THF while ProDOT-Cbz, ProDOT-Py, and
ProDOT2-Py required the use of hot 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene
(TCB). To be able to make a comparison of the diﬀerence in
solubility and its eﬀect on molecular weight measurements,
GPC of ProDOT-Ph was measured in both solvents and served
as a comparison. Attempts using THF for ProDOT-Cbz
yielded a chromatogram that was bimodal, and ProDOT-Py
and ProDOT2-Py were insoluble in THF and had limited
solubility in boiling o-DCB as these polymers have a tendency
to aggregate, particularly in the case of the pyrenes.28,29 The
polymers in this study have suﬃciently high molecular weights
to yield saturated conjugation lengths to give the desired
spectra and colors, while forming continuous electrode
supported ﬁlms via spray-coating.

A thorough study on the transmetalation step in Suzuki
couplings30,31 allowed us to synthesize ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2
and R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2 with Mn over 10 kDa by
changing the base from 3 M K3PO4 to 6 M cesium ﬂuoride,
though the yields are still signiﬁcantly lower compared to the
other polymerizationslikely due to premature hydrolysis of
the boronate ester prior to transmetalation. Initial attempts to
attain ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2 and R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2
using potassium phosphate as a base yielded only oligomeric
materials. Microwave heating was attempted but yielded
products with Mn no higher than 8 kDa.
Redox and Optoelectronic Properties. All of the
materials discussed herein have varying band gaps (Eg),
absorption maxima (λmax), colorimetric proﬁles, and oxidation
potentials (Eox). To facilitate the comparison of the properties
of each polymer, all relevant optical and electrochemical values
are provided in Table 2.
Electrochemistry. Diﬀerential pulse voltammetry (DPV)
was used to determine the eﬀect of each aromatic core coupled
with ProDOT (or BiProDOT as is the case of ProDOT2-Ph
and ProDOT2-Py) on the Eox of the resulting polymers. All
polymers, with the exception of ProDOT-Py and ProDOT2-Py
due to solubility issues, were dissolved in 0.5 mg/mL in toluene
and drop-cast onto platinum button electrodes and allowed to
dry in air. Because of the requirement to dissolve ProDOT-Py
and ProDOT2-Py in boiling chlorobenzene or hot o-DCB, DPV
on button electrodes was not possible as polymer adhesion
issues were encountered. To circumvent this, the ﬁlms were
spin-cast onto ITO-coated glass slides using a hot 20 mg/mL
solution in o-DCB at 2200 rpm for 40 s, achieving transparent
ﬁlms with only minor defects from aggregation. The ﬁlms on
the electrodes were immersed in a solution of 0.2 M lithium
bis(triﬂuoromethyl)sulfonylimide (LiBTI) in propylene carbo-
nate (PC) with a platinum ﬂag counter electrode and a Ag/Ag+
reference electrode (calibrated to Fc/Fc+). All potentials are
reported relative to this reference electrode, and further details
are provided in the Supporting Information. Because of slow
relaxation eﬀects in neutral conjugated polymers from
intercalation of solvent and ions,32−34 ﬁlms were “broken in”
prior to performing DPV by repeated cyclic voltammetry (CV)
cycling for 4−6 scans from 0 V to a potential where each
polymer ﬁlm attains its most stable transmissive state. The
complete DPV and CV results for all polymers are given in the
Supporting Information, Figure S2.
A comparison of the DPV oxidation scans for ProDOT-Ph,
ProDOT-Fl, ProDOT-Cbz, and ProDOT2-Ph is shown in
Figure 1 where the trend of oxidation potential onsets (from
highest to lowest) is as follows: ProDOT-Fl (650 mV) >
ProDOT-Ph (500 mV) > ProDOT-Py (460 mV) > ProDOT-
Cbz (450 mV) > ProDOT2-Py = R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2
(320 mV) > ProDOT2-Ph (300 mV) > ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2
(270 mV).
It can be seen that ProDOT-Fl has the highest Eox, a 150 mV
increase compared to ProDOT-Ph. This is attributed to the
bridged biphenyl nature of the ﬂuorene, where the additional
phenylene ring decreases the HOMO level, giving a higher
oxidation potential. ProDOT-Ph has the second highest Eox due
to the high aromaticity of the phenylene unit, imparting a low-
lying HOMO. The Eox for ProDOT-Py is 190 mV less than
ProDOT-Fl and 40 mV less than ProDOT-Ph. For ProDOT-
Cbz, the use of carbazole in the repeat unit gave a further
decrease in the trend of oxidation potentials and can be
attributed to the electron-donating ability of the nitrogen atom
bridging the two phenylene rings, raising the HOMO. The
random polymer, R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2, and the alternat-
ing polymer, ProDOT2-Py, both possess the same Eox. This
lowering of potential for R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2 was
achieved by randomly incorporating phenylene and electron-
rich dimethoxyphenylene into the repeat unit, raising the
HOMO relative to ProDOT-Ph. For ProDOT2-Py, the
incorporation of an additional electron-rich ProDOT in an
alternating repeat unit with pyrene raised the HOMO relative
to ProDOT-Py. The Eox of ProDOT2-Ph is the second lowest
in the trend by similar reasoning with ProDOT2-Py. The lowest
Eox of the series is for ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2, achieved by adding
a more electron-rich arylene unit in alternation with a single
ProDOT.
All of the polymers discussed have been switched up to 50
cycles with little loss in electroactivity with the exception of
ProDOT-Py. Switching for short periods of time was examined
(see Chronoabsorptometry section); however, the character-

istics are electrolyte dependent, and optimizing this is beyond
of the scope of the paper. Unfortunately, the materials
containing pyrene are diﬃcult to dissolve and cast into usable
ﬁlms, and ProDOT-Py exhibits poor switching stability. It
should be noted that ProDOT2-Py is a modiﬁcation of a
previously reported yellow ECP where the connectivity of the
system is at the 1,6-positions of the pyrene ring, giving it a
considerably high Eox value.20 In our work, the connectivity is
through the 2,7-positions of the pyrene ring, aﬀording greater
conjugation as evident by the lower oxidation potential of
ProDOT2-Py.
Optical Properties. UV/vis spectroscopy of polymer
solutions was performed to probe repeat unit structural eﬀects
on spectra. The normalized spectra of each solution are shown
in Figure 2 with inset photographs of the solutions in vials
under white light.
When considering the λmax of all polymers in solution (from
shortest to longest), the trend is as follows: ProDOT-Py (417
nm) < ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2 (422 nm) < ProDOT-Fl (436 nm)
< R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2 (438 nm) < ProDOT-Cbz (446
nm) < ProDOT-Ph (448 nm) < ProDOT2-Py (475 nm) <
ProDOT2-Ph (506 nm).
From the trend, ProDOT-Py has the shortest λmax. ProDOT-
Ph(MeO)2 has the second shortest λmax, ascribed to the bulky
methoxy units in place of the smaller hydrogen atom on the
phenylene ring. An alternative possibility for this increase is the
raised LUMO from the more electron rich arylene. ProDOT-Fl
has the next red-shifted λmax. R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2 has an
even longer λmax attributed to backbone relaxation from
randomly dispersed phenylene units that possess smaller
hydrogen atoms, when compared to ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2.
ProDOT-CBz possesses a λmax that is longer than ProDOT-Fl,
possibly from electron donation from the nitrogen atom
bridging the biphenyl, raising the HOMO. The third longest
λmax is for ProDOT-Ph, due to subtle ortho C−H interactions
from a single phenylene in alternation with ProDOT. The
second longest λmax for ProDOT2-Py is believed to be due to
the additional ProDOT ring in the repeat allowing S−O
interactions between neighboring ProDOTs, facilitating
planarity
and
increasing
conjugation
along
the
backbone.35,36,23 Additionally, increased content of the
electron-rich ProDOT unit could serve to raise the HOMO
of the polymer. The longest λmax is exhibited by ProDOT2-Ph
as per the same reasoning discussed with ProDOT2-Py.
All of the solutions are vibrant shades of yellow except for
ProDOT2-Ph, which is a peach color as shown in the inset of
Figure 2B. From Figure 2, ProDOT2-Ph has a solution spectral
proﬁle similar in shape and width to ProDOT-Cbz and
ProDOT-Ph, but red-shifted by ∼60 nm. The peaks at ∼350
nm are typically observed for pyrene related materials.37,38
To analyze the absorption proﬁles at various applied
potentials in solid ﬁlms, all polymers, with the exception of
ProDOT-Py and ProDOT2-Py, were dissolved in toluene and
spray-cast into ﬁlms. ProDOT-Py and ProDOT2-Py required
spin-coating due to the aforementioned necessity of using hot
solutions of o-DCB. All of the ﬁlms were broken in with 4−6
repeated CV cycles, then held at their neutral state potentials,
and gradually oxidized in 50 mV steps until oxidized to the
most transmissive state. The neutral state spectra of each
polymer cast as a ﬁlm at 0 V can be seen in Figure 3.
In the neutral state, ﬁlms of polymers exhibited the following
trend based on band gap (from highest to lowest): ProDOT-Py
(2.59 eV) > ProDOT-Fl (2.51 eV) > ProDOT-Cbz (2.48 eV) >
ProDOT-Ph = ProDOT2-Py (2.42 eV) > R-ProDOT-Ph/
Ph(MeO)2 (2.26 eV) > ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2 (2.25 eV) >
ProDOT2-Ph (2.23 eV).
In the solid state, the trend is comparable to solution, and as
expected there is a red-shift in the ﬁlm absorption proﬁles. The
notable exceptions are polymers that contain dimethoxyphe-
nylene; these exhibit considerable red-shifted spectra in the
solid state relative to their solution forms. Random copolymer
R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2 has the third lowest Eg, indicating
that there is an increase in conjugation along the backbone,
facilitated by the methoxy groups on the phenylene cores
inducing S−O interactions with their ProDOT neighbors. The
second lowest Eg is for ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2, slightly lower than
R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2little change in the Eg. However,
due to dimethoxy-substituted phenylene replacing unsubsti-
tuted phenylene, ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2 has a narrower absorp-
tion proﬁle, lacking high-energy transitions imparted by
phenylene neighbors that would induce strain in the backbone.
ProDOT2-Ph exhibits an absorption proﬁle of similar shape to
that of ProDOT-Ph but is red-shifted by ∼40 nm, giving it a
vibrant peach color.

oxidized from their neutral forms to the most transmissive,

exhibited the purest yellow neutral state and switched to the
most transmissive oxidized state and is exempliﬁed by the
spectroelectrochemical series and photographs shown in the
inset to Figure 4 where the peak at 610 nm is assigned to a
polaron and the broad absorption into the NIR is attributed to
a bipolaron.39 Upon oxidation to 1100 mV ProDOT-Cbz is
able to achieve the most transmissive oxidized state, and the
neutral state color is closer to yellow as deﬁned by Munsell (L*
= 81.7, a* = 4.0, b* = 79.8)40 than the other polymers. At
∼1180 nm, the transmittance is greater than 100% in the
neutral state. This is due to index matching between the
electrolyte, polymer layer, ITO, and glass exhibiting behavior
akin to an antireﬂective coating, allowing more light to pass
through the ﬁlm and reach the detector relative to the
baseline.41,42 The spectroelectrochemistry for all others are
provided in Figure S3.
A comparison of ProDOT-Cbz, R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2,
and ProDOT-Ph in the neutral and most oxidized transmissive
states is shown in Figure 5. These three polymers were chosen
as they display a true yellow color as deﬁned by Munsell while
also achieving the highest transmission in the oxidized state of
the family reported. Of the three polymers one can see that
ProDOT-Cbz is able to acquire the most transmissive oxidized
state (also evident in the photographs in Figure S5) and is the
most transmissive of all of the polymers studied. This is
possible due to lower absorption of residual long wavelength
visible light with an oxidation potential that is 50 mV less than
ProDOT-Ph.
Chronoabsorptometry. To understand the rate at which
the bleaching/coloring processes occur under repeated cycles
between the fully colored and bleached states, chronoabsorp-
tometry was performed. The polymer ﬁlms, cast onto ITO/
glass, were immersed in a fresh electrolyte solution, broken in
with 4−6 CV cycles, and then switched using potential square-
waves between the extreme states in intervals of 10 to 1/4 s,
while the transmission was measured at a single wavelength
(polymer λmax determined from spectroelectrochemistry).
Chronoabsorptometry of ProDOT-Cbz is shown in Figure 6
with results for the other materials in Figure S4. At 1 s and
longer intervals ProDOT-Cbz possessed a change in trans-
mittance (Δ%T) of 51%, switching from a vibrant yellow
neutral state to a highly transmissive oxidized state. At shorter
switching intervals, Δ%T for this polymer decreased signiﬁ-
cantly to 40% at 1/2 s and 30% at 1/4 s, both switching from
vibrant yellow states to blue/gray intermediate states.

Colorimetry and Photographs. To elucidate the color
properties of each polymer, colorimetry within the switching
window was measured, and photographs were obtained for
each system. The color of each polymer ﬁlm was assessed by
utilizing the CIE 1976 L*a*b* Color Space with a D50
illuminant as detailed in the Supporting Information. The
colorimetry of ProDOT-Cbz is shown in Figure 7 and Figure
S5. Over a range of ﬁlm thicknesses (measured by optical
density), from thin ﬁlms with low optical density (0.65
absorbance) to thick ﬁlms with higher optical density (1.42
absorbance), a*b* color values progress further from the origin,
increasing color saturation. Values of a* minimally change from
−7.7 to −10.6 while b* values progress from 60 and to 100,
giving more saturated yellow colors with increasing thickness.
The polymer exhibits two transmissive oxidized states. The ﬁrst
at 700 mV is transmissive and color neutral as seen in the
photographs; however, at this voltage the transmission is 50%
hence, color neutral with low a*b* values. At 850 mV, the
polymer exhibits a blue intermediate state due to residual
absorption peaking at 610 nm as can be seen in Figures 4 and 7.
The most transparent state is achieved at a voltage of 1100 mV;
the ﬁnal voltage before overoxidation occurs. The polymer is
capable of solid state emission as supported by ﬂuorescence
studies, and photographs of solid ﬁlms under UV exposure are
provided in the Supporting Information Figures S7−S9. All of
these materials possess various neutral state shades of yellow
and exhibit transmissive or near-transmissive oxidized states as
can be seen in the Supporting Information, Figure S5.
The lightness (L*) of all the polymers during electrochromic
switching begin at relatively high L* in their neutral forms with
values greater than 84. To aid in the comparison between the
neutral and oxidized state, L* of all materials have been
provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S6). Upon
oxidation to the most transmissive forms, the polymers possess
L* values of no less than 84 with the exceptions of R-ProDOT-
Ph/Ph(MeO)2, ProDOT-Py, and ProDOT2-Py due to residual
absorption of visible light in the most oxidized state.
For yellow ECPs undergoing redox processes, the subtle
change in L* is related to the sensitivity of the y̅(λ) component
of the CIE standard observer color matching functions (y̅ peaks
at 555 nm), and these functions are used when calculating Y
according to CIE for the calculation of L*.43 As illustrated in
Figure 8, the spectral sensitivity curve of this standard observer
has little overlap with the neutral state absorption spectra of
ProDOT-Ph (or any of the polymers discussed herein). Once
oxidized to the intermediate state, ProDOT-Ph (and the other
yellow ECPs) exhibits a signiﬁcant dip in lightness as the
absorption spectra of these states now overlap with the y̅(λ)
component.
To gain a greater understanding of the breadth of colors
achieved in the neutral state, we present a colorimetric
comparison of all polymers studied. As shown in Figure 9, all
neutral state colors range from vibrant yellows similar to
ProDOT-Ph (ProDOT-Cbz possessing nearly the same a*b*
values during switching) to colors bordering on or falling into
the orange region of the L*a*b* color space such as the case
for ProDOT2-Ph.
Films of ProDOT-Ph, ProDOT-Cbz, and R-ProDOT-Ph/
Ph(MeO)2 in the neutral, intermediate, and fully oxidized states
on one piece of ITO-coated glass in electrolyte solution are
shown in Figure 10. Aesthetically speaking, all three polymers
appear yellow to the eye with low a* and high b* values
describing them as yellow hues. Of the three, R-ProDOT-Ph/
Ph(MeO)2 has the lowest oxidation potential (320 mV) with a
similar yellow neutral state. Unfortunately, it suﬀers from
residual color in its most oxidized form.

■CONCLUSION
We have successfully synthesized seven new electrochromic
polymers via Suzuki polycondensation conditions. All of the
materials maintained yellow and near-yellow neutral states
while varying the oxidation potential. They all possess oxidation
potentials that increase in the order of ProDOT-Ph(MeO)2 <
ProDOT2-Ph < ProDOT2-Py = R-ProDOT-Ph/Ph(MeO)2 <
ProDOT-Cbz < ProDOT-Py < ProDOT-Ph < ProDOT-Fl. Of
the family, ProDOT-Cbz shows optical properties well suited
for yellow-to-transmissive switching applications and also has a
decreased oxidation potential with respect to ProDOT-Ph, our
original yellow electrochromic polymer.
In general, phenylene-type rings neighboring ProDOTs in a
polymer chain lead to absorption of high-energy light in the
visible, yielding vibrant yellow neutral states. These rings are
highly aromatic and cause the polymers to oxidize at elevated
potentials. However, the addition of electron-donating oxygen
atoms on phenylene rings or the introduction of additional
ProDOT units can decrease oxidation potentials. The decrease
in oxidation potential comes at the cost of red-shifting or
broadening of the overall spectrum, thus yielding orange hues,
and is a challenge that will need to be addressed in the
development of future yellow systems.
