Spray-Processable Blue-to-Highly Transmissive
Switching Polymer Electrochromes via the
Donor–Acceptor Approach
By Chad M. Amb, Pierre M. Beaujuge, and John R. Reynolds*
Relying on low-power stimulated optical changes, non-emissive
electrochromic (EC) technologies can be operated under a wide
range of viewing angles and lighting conditions (e.g., direct
sunlight), making them especially desirable in the development
of ﬂexible-display-device applications including electronic papers
(e-papers) and large-area information panels.[1,2] With their
applicability in scalable and cost-effective manufacturing pro-
cesses spanning inkjet- and ﬂexo-printing, solution-processable
p-conjugated polymers are ﬁnding the path to commercialization
in several areas including solar power conversion[3] and are now
expected to be applied to various transmissive/reﬂective electro-
chromic device (ECD) conﬁgurations.[1] However, for electro-
chromic polymers (ECPs) to compete with the more established
electrophoretic technologies, their potential for color tunability
should be conﬁrmed by extending the design and synthesis of
polymer electrochromes to a palette of derivatives possessing
complementary color states, as well as a redox accessible
transmissive state.
The homopolymerization of dioxythiophenes[4–7] (DOTs) and
other electron-rich monomers[8–10] with a high-lying highest
occupied
molecular
orbital
(HOMO)
commonly
produces
narrow-bandgap materials absorbing in the red region of the
visible spectrum, hence, exhibiting colors ranging from purple to
dark blue. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that only a few are, at
the same time, solution-processable (the vast majority being
electropolymerized from unsubstituted monomers), cathodically
coloring, and fast-switching analogues with long-term stability on
repeated electrochemical switching.[8,11] In parallel, the ‘‘donor–
acceptor’’ (DA) approach,[12] now frequently applied to macro-
molecular systems in the context of bandgap engineering, has
recently been employed to achieve blue-to-clear switching ECPs
incorporating low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) moieties such as cyanovinylene[13] and benzotriazole,[14]
thus, introducing the perspective of reducing the electron-rich
character of the backbone, while retaining the low bandgap
producing
the
desired
blue
color.
In
spite
of
these
developments,
designing
neutral-state
blue
polymer
electrochromes combining solution processability, high contrast
ratios attainable in subsecond switching times, and long-term
redox stability (over 10000 cycles) represents the next logical step
towards truly useful EC materials.
In recent work, we investigated the effect of varying the relative
contribution of electron-rich and electron-deﬁcient heterocycles
composing the polymer repeat unit on the absorption spectrum of
a series of well-deﬁned p-conjugated polymers containing various
DOTs
and
2,1,3-benzothiadiazole
(BTD)
as
the
accepting
component (see Fig. 1a P1–P3).[15] These polymers were shown
to possess a dual band of absorption in the visible spectrum
consisting of a short- and a long-wavelength absorption band,
which can be modulated in terms of their relative intensity,
wavelength maxima, and absorption onsets as a function of the
DA content in the main-chain. In particular, when the local
minimum of absorption separating these two optical transitions
was positioned in the 500–550-nm range, the resulting ECPs were
found to exhibit the color green,[16] a color-state historically
difﬁcult to achieve in the ﬁeld of p-conjugated polymers.[17,18]
Herein, we demonstrate how the dual band of absorption
found in macromolecular p-conjugated systems alternating
electron-rich and -poor heterocycles[15,19–22] can be tailored to
open a broad window of transmission in the high-energy region
of the visible spectrum, with the goal of producing neutral-state
saturated blue ECPs. In this instance, the extent of electron-rich
building units along the polymer backbone has been reduced to a
point where the short-wavelength absorption band of the polymer
is
fully
transferred
into
the
UV
to
maximize
the
blue
transmission,
while
the
long-wavelength
optical
transition
extends from the green region up to the near-IR (see Fig. 1b,
P4a). Our approach is exempliﬁed by a series of spray-processable
cathodically coloring polymer electrochromes that switch to a
highly transmissive oxidized state on electrochemical doping.
The corresponding polymers are linear, strictly alternating in
terms of their DA content (see Fig. 1c P4a–P4c), and possess
oxidation potentials sufﬁciently high to provide ambient stability
[in contrast with the majority of their all-donor counterparts
including poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)][7] but low
enough to allow fast and reversible redox switching on repeated
cycling. In addition, an ester-functionalized DA electrochrome
(P4c) was achieved by solubilizing side chains that can be
chemically removed in a postdeposition processing step to
produce ﬁlms insoluble in conventional organic solvents that
retain their electroactivity. Our strategy offers perspectives for the
fabrication of long-lived electrolyte-based switchable devices, as
well as in the processing of vertically stacked ECDs with multiple
electroactive layers.

While the origin of the dual-band absorption sometimes
encountered in DA-type semiconducting polymers remains a
source of debate, two mainstream rationales have been frequently
proposed. A ﬁrst assumption attributes the lower-energy optical
transition to the presence of intramolecular charge-transfer
excitons occurring on the presence of covalently bound DA
segments along the backbone.[23,24] A second assumption
considers the presence of low-lying unoccupied energy levels,
strictly localized on the electron-deﬁcient heterocycles, yet
forming a discrete ‘‘band’’ of easily accessed energy states within
the
‘‘bandgap’’
of
the
conjugated
system
in
its
ground
state.[16,25–27] In both cases, the higher-energy transitions appear
localized on the most-electron-rich building units incorporated
along the polymer backbone with a clear dependence on their
relative concentration to the electron-deﬁcient heterocycles.[15]
This distinct contribution from the electron-rich segments on
the short-wavelength absorption band in DA backbones is
illustrated in Figure 1b, where the said optical transition
undergoes a hypsochromic shift ranging from 25 to 40 nm as
the number of 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) units
incorporated in the repeat unit is decreased from 6 (P1), to 4 (P2),
and to 2 (P3) units. In parallel, the long-wavelength absorption
band red shifts with increasing number of BTDs in the repeat
unit, and the peak-to-peak distance between the two bands of
absorption increases dramatically, hence, opening a window of
transmission in the blue-green region of the visible.
With the idea of extending this window of transmission into
the blue region of the spectrum by fully rejecting the high-energy
optical transition into the UV, the synthesis of a strictly alternating
DA copolymer of ProDOT and BTD was envisioned (see Fig. 1a,
P4a). In contrast with P1–P3, which were chemically polymerized
from
symmetrical
donor–acceptor–donor
(DAD)
oligomers
via the mild oxidizing agent FeCl3,[15] a palladium-mediated
polycondensation route had to be introduced to afford the desired
DA alternating pattern. However, the relative difﬁculty and
particularly low yields associated with the synthesis of difunctio-
nalized organostannane and organoborane derivatives of diox-
ythiophenes prevented us from using common polymerization
methodology, whereby the most electron-poor heterocycle acts as
the ‘‘electrophile’’ (which undergoes oxidative addition) and the
electron-rich counterpart acts as the ‘‘nucleophile’’ (in transme-
tallation).[20,28–31] Scanning the literature, we found a unique
example of a DA copolymer synthesized by inverting the
functionalities between donor and acceptor.[32,33] In this work,
BTD was difunctionalized with pinacol ester-protected boronic
acid in a one-step Miyaura borylation. Upon optimization of the
step relative to the synthesis of the organoborane derivative of
BTD
(see
Experimental
section),
two
dialkoxy-substituted
ProDOT–BTD copolymers (namely P4a and P4b) were subse-
quently produced in excellent yields (>90%), with number
average molecular weights (Mn) as high as 23 kDa by using
traditional Suzuki cross-coupling conditions (see Fig. 1c). In
addition, a didodecylester-substituted DA analogue, namely P4c,
was successfully achieved (Mn ¼ 11.1 kDa) using a modiﬁcation
of the base-free Suzuki conditions described earlier by our
group.[34] Overall, the low toxicity of the reagents used, combined
with the simplicity and the scalability of the synthetic pathway
described in Figure 1c, makes this process attractive for the
production of these materials on an industrial scale.
The UV–vis absorption spectrum of P4a in toluene solution is
shown in Figure 1b (P4b and P4c present similar characteristics,
see also the Supporting Information, Fig. S1). As expected, in
analogy with P1–P3, P4a exhibits a dual band of absorption, in
this case peaking at 368 and 662 nm, respectively, in turn leaving a
well of transmission extended over the entire blue region
(420–490 nm) of the visible light, with a local minimum of
absorption at 432 nm. Importantly, P4a–P4c show only minor
optical changes upon elevating the temperature (ambient to
100 8C), indicating neither signiﬁcant disruption of effective
conjugation nor major aggregation of the solvated backbones.

Thin ﬁlms of P4a and P4b were spray-cast onto indium tin
oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides from warm mixtures of toluene
and chloroform (ca. 40 8C) and, subsequently, redox cycled until a
stable and reproducible switch was obtained prior to spectro-
electrochemical analysis. P4a and P4b were found to possess
relatively narrow bandgaps of 1.51 eV, and 1.53 eV respectively, as
determined from the onset of their neutral-state lower-energy
optical transition. An external bias was applied to the polymer
ﬁlms placed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell and was
gradually increased (in 25 mV steps) to induce simultaneous
bleaching (starting at ca. 0.12 V vs. Fc/Fcþ) of both the short- and
long-wavelength absorption bands in the UV–vis region. The
depletion of the neutral-state optical absorption of the copolymers
was
accompanied
by
the
concomitant
formation
of
new
transitions arising in the near-IR region of the spectrum (see
Fig. 2a), indicating the development of radical cations (polarons),
further combining into dications (bipolarons) at higher biases.
Interestingly, the linearly substituted copolymer P4b switched
more effectively to its transmissive oxidized state on full doping
in comparison with the nearly identical, yet branch-substituted
analogue P4a (see Supporting Information, S2). This can
practically be seen from the extent of overlap of their respective
bipolaronic optical transition with the visible spectrum (in the
600–800 nm range). Here, the bipolaronic transition of P4a peaks
at wavelengths lower than 1400 nm, while that of P4b peaks above
1400 nm (at ca. 1460 nm), as can be seen from Figure 2a, and
tails less into the visible. It is worth noting that the opposite trend
has frequently been observed in p-conjugated polymers with
various substitution patterns, as the best candidates tend to be the
ones likely to exhibit the most open morphologies, in correlation
with their ability to facilitate the diffusion of charge-balancing
ions occurring on redox doping/dedoping.[4,6,10,35–37] The better
‘‘packing ability’’ of the linearly substituted derivative P4a on full
oxidation may explain the notable bathochromic shift undergone
by its bipolaronic transition in the near-IR. In parallel, thin ﬁlms
of P4b start oxidizing at slightly lower potentials (þ0.05 V vs. Fc/
Fcþ) than those of P4a (þ0.12 V vs. Fc/Fcþ), as supported by
differential pulse voltammetry (see S3), whereby the onset of
oxidation of P4b occurs at slightly less positive potentials (ca.
0.16 V) than that of P4a (ca. þ0.09 V). The resulting higher
HOMO level of P4b may further contribute to its propensity to
produce more transmissive oxidized states upon electrochemical
doping. Based on those spectroelectrochemical data, P4a exhibits
an EC contrast (i.e., a monochromatic change in transmittance,
D%T) in the order of 40% at its longer-wavelength absorption
maximum (663 nm), while values as high as 52% were attained
with P4b at the same long-wavelength absorption maximum
(642 nm).
Monitoring the brightness of transmitted light as a percentage
of the brightness of a light source calibrated to the sensitivity of
the human eye, the relative luminance change was measured for
the
ﬁlms
upon
increasing
the
doping
level
induced
by
electrochemical oxidation. Here, P4a was found to switch from
its neutral state, blue, to its highly transmissive oxidized state with
up to 44% change in relative luminance (see S4), while ﬁlms of
P4b of near-equal thickness, and even thicker, exhibited up to ca.
47%, as illustrated in Figure 2b. The saturated blue color of the
neutral-state polymers was supported by a colorimetry study,
which indicated largely negative b* values at all ﬁlm thicknesses,
along with especially small a* values (negative values indicating
the extent of green hue) in comparison with b* (L*a*b* refers to
the Commission internationale de l’e´clairage (CIE) 1976 L*a*b*
color model). Upon full oxidation, P4b exhibits L* values ranging
from 82 to 89 depending on the optical density of the deposited
ﬁlm. Further, with a* and b* values as low as 5 and 3,
respectively, P4b yields transmissive states in which residual tints
can hardly be perceived by the human eye, demonstrating the
aptitude of the electrochrome to nearly reach the ‘‘white point’’ of
color space. In comparison, higher-optical-density ﬁlms of P4a do
not show the same propensity to bleach and a trade-off in terms of
contrasts observed can be found for ﬁlms with optical densities
greater than 1.1 a.u. This reduction in electrochromic contrast
with increased thickness observed in the case of P4a has been
previously observed in other polymer electrochromes.[35] Overall,
the polymers complete their full switches in a potential window of
less than 1 V (90% of optical change is attained in ca. 0.5 V for P4a
and ca. 0.8 V for P4b), a parameter of signiﬁcant interest for
low-voltage device applications.

Electrochemical oxidation of the ﬁlms was carried out in 0.1 M LiBF4/PC supporting electrolyte using a silver wire as a quasireference electrode (calibrated
against Fc/Fcþ) and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The applied potential was increased in 25 mV steps from 0 to 0.95 V vs. Fc/Fcþ. b) Relative

The EC contrasts for the polymers (D%T) were monitored as a
function of time at their longer-wavelength absorption maximum
by applying squarewave potential steps of 10, 2, and 1 s. In this
case, the 0.1 M LiBF4/PC solution electrolyte system used
throughout the spectroelectrochemical and colorimetric experi-
ments was replaced by a 0.2 M lithium bis(triﬂuoromethanesul-
fonyl)imide (LiBTI)/PC solution electrolyte, which was found to
signiﬁcantly improve the response times for the polymers (while
time was not a factor of importance in the previous experiments).
As illustrated in Figure 2c, a variation of EC contrast (D%T) of
only ca. 2% was monitored in the case of P4b on decreasing the
switch time from 10 s to 1 s, an important result when
considering the execution speed in switchable display devices.
Further, in agreement with the spectroelectrochemical data, the
EC contrast attainable with P4b (e.g., 41.5% when n ¼ 10 s) on
repeated squarewave potential stepping was found higher than
that of P4a (e.g., 35.2% when n ¼ 10 s) for ﬁlms of near-identical
optical density. While P4b was found to reach its full switch faster
than P4a, both polymers attained 95% of a complete switch in less
than 1 s (t95% ¼ 0.80 s in the case of P4a, t95% ¼ 0.45 s in the case
of P4b), again, reinforcing their potential for applications in
products such as displays, which require fast response times.
The long-term stability of the polymers was investigated by
monitoring the EC contrast (D%T) of the thin ﬁlms (as described
in Fig. 2c) upon repeated squarewave potential steps of 1 s
(complete cycle is 2 s) in a 0.2 M LiBTI/PC solution electrolyte
system. In over 10000 cycles under ambient conditions, P4a and
P4b showed a variation of EC contrast (D%T) of less than 7% (see
Fig. S5), hence, satisfying the requirements for polymer
electrochromes applicable to cost-effective ambient device-
manufacturing processes.
Encouraged by the excellent results obtained with P4a and P4b
in terms of contrast, response times, and switching stability, we
developed the didodecylester-substituted DA copolymer analogue
P4c with the perspective of cleaving its solubilizing side chains via
a basic hydrolysis of the esters (saponiﬁcation) achieved directly
from
the
thin
ﬁlms.
Conjugated
polymers
that
can
be
solution-processed and, subsequently, defunctionalized to pro-
duce ﬁlms insoluble in most conventional organic solvents have
recently emerged for use in EC and multilayer light-emitting
diode (LED) devices,[38] transistors,[39] and photovoltaic cells.[40]
In the case of P4c, we found that the spray-cast polymer can be
effectively defunctionalized by immersing the ﬁlms in a 1 M KOH
methanol solution for 4 h at 70 8C. As demonstrated in Figure 3a,
the same conditions can be applied to the saponiﬁcation of the
ﬁnely ground polymer itself, hence, replacing the aliphatic esters
by carboxylate functionalities on each ProDOT heterocycle along
the backbone. Here, the conversion from the esters to the
carboxylates is evidenced by a distinct shift of the C¼O stretching
band towards lower frequencies (from 1734 to 1560 cm1), along
with a broadening of the corresponding band. In parallel, the loss
of the aliphatic side chains is clearly visible through the depletion
of the CH-stretching-band intensity at higher frequencies
(2800–3000 cm1). Figure 3b illustrates the differences in
solubility for the DA polymer before and after saponiﬁcation,
with the non-defunctionalized ﬁlm dissolving instantaneously on
immersion in CHCl3 (left set of photographs), while the
saponiﬁed counterpart holds to the substrate (right set of
photographs), even after prolonged exposure to the solvent or on
elevation of the temperature. As seen in Figure 3c, a series of
squarewave potential steps applied to a defunctionalized thin ﬁlm
of P4c conﬁrms that the electroactivity of the electrochrome is
retained throughout the defunctionalization process. Here, the
freshly hydrolyzed ﬁlm was rapidly neutralized in an aqueous
solution of HCl (1 M) and subsequently rinsed with methanol,
prior to electrochemical switching. Further work exploring the
performance and the solubility of this structurally modiﬁed ECP
is underway, including the construction of display devices with
architectures taking advantage of the solubility change undergone
by the electrochrome.
In summary, a series of spray-processable p-conjugated
polymer electrochromes switching from a saturated-blue to a
highly transmissive oxidized state on electrochemical doping
were designed with strictly alternating electron-rich and -poor
heterocycles, and synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation. In
this study, the dual band of absorption often found in DA
macromolecular p-conjugated systems[15,19–22] was modulated by
reducing the extent of electron-rich units along the polymer
Figure 3. a) IR absorption spectra of P4c before (bottom) and after (top) defunctionalization of the solubilizing side chains. The spectrum before

backbone to a point where the short-wavelength absorption band
of the polymer is fully transferred into the UV, hence, opening a
broad window of transmission in the blue region of the visible
spectrum. In contrast, more electron-rich parent copolymers have
been found to possess a two-band absorption in the visible, in
turn exhibiting colors ranging from blue-green to green.[15,16]
Optical and electrochemical investigation of the neutral-state blue
electrochromes revealed excellent optical contrasts, both in the
visible and in the near-IR, small potential windows of operation,
fast switching times, and long-term stability. Besides the initial
solution-processability of all the polymer precursors described in
this Communication, the postdeposition saponiﬁcation of thin
ﬁlms of ProDOT–BTD copolymer electrochromes substituted
with alkyl ester side-chains offers unique perspectives for the
construction of long-lived electrolyte-based display devices, as
well as in the processing of vertically-stacked ECDs with multiple
electroactive layers.
