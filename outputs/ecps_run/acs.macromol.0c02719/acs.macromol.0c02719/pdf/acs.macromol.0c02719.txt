ABSTRACT: Subtle structural changes in monomeric building
blocks can have an immense eﬀect, whether positive or
detrimental, on the resulting properties of conjugated polymers.
With this in mind, it is paramount to understand structure−
property relationships that serve as the guiding principles for
manipulating optical and electrochemical characteristics. Herein, a
family of dialkylthiophene-co-propylenedioxythiophene copoly-
mers are synthesized via direct arylation polymerizations, with a
key design motif being minimal changes in the structural
composition of the propylenedioxythiophene comonomer. Varia-
tion in the substitution pattern on the propylene bridge provides insights into the role of stereo- and compositional isomers on the
resulting polymer properties. Speciﬁcally, time-dependent density functional theory calculations reveal changes in the number and
placement of comonomers with varying composition and stereocenters, impacting the calculated absorbance spectra, as evident from
calculated absorbance maxima spanning 75 nm, which ultimately manifests in diﬀerences in the calculated color. Experimentally,
UV−vis absorbance spectroscopy and colorimetry reveal a dependence on the stereo- and regiospeciﬁcity, while electrochromic
properties, such as contrast and switching times, are not drastically aﬀected by the substitution patterns. Independent of position and
functionality, each polymer exhibited a transmittance change greater than 65% at the maximum absorbance wavelength while
maintaining the ability to rapidly switch between colored and transmissive states in organic electrolytes. This work highlights how
subtle structural changes can manipulate and optimize optical features without sacriﬁcing electrochromic properties such as kinetic
switching time and optical contrast. In addition to fundamental insights into monomeric design of propylenedioxythiophene building
blocks and their optical and redox characteristics, the results provide an additional structural handle for ﬁne-tuning the observed
color of electrochromic polymers.
■INTRODUCTION
Conjugated polymers ﬁnd utility in redox-active applica-
tions,1−3 such as electrochromism4,5 and bioelectronics,6 due
to the ability to readily manipulate their properties and
processability through synthetic design. For example, when
considering electrochromism, full color control is possible by
balancing electronic and steric contributions from comono-
mers and their respective side chains.7 Additionally, broadly
absorbing electrochromic polymers (ECPs) can be synthesized
to access various shades of black electrochromic ﬁlms using the
donor−acceptor approach8−13 or diﬀerent hues across the
color palette using all-thiophene terpolymers.14 While robust
structure−property relationships that enable accurate color
control have been established, high-gap ECPs with optical
absorbances between 380 and 550 nm to produce ﬁlms in the
yellow−orange−red color space are still a signiﬁcant challenge
for the ﬁeld. Tailoring polymer structures that absorb in the
high-gap region of the visible spectrum is challenging due to
the diﬃculty in balancing desired optical features with
electrochemical properties. High-gap ECPs are desirable from
a practical point of view due to their utility as components of
subtractive color mixing ECP blends to access various
secondary colors around the color palette or blacks and
browns via coprocessing.15−21 One major limitation for these
blends is the long-term switching stability between colored and
transmissive states due to the instability of chemical structures
that absorb in this region of the visible spectrum. Therefore, it
is necessary to establish eﬀective design strategies for
synthesizing electrochemically stable high-gap ECPs.
Historically, triphenylamine-type comonomers have been
shown to be suitable building blocks to access optical
absorbance proﬁles that yield yellow electrochromic ﬁlms.
The resulting copolymers suﬀer from having high oxidation
potentials and diﬃculty reaching a fully transmissive state upon
oxidation due to the disruption of conjugation by the nitrogen
lone pair of electrons.22−25 Eﬀorts from both Sotzing and co-

workers, and our group, have involved utilizing redox-active
dioxythiophenes as an alternative design strategy. Sotzing’s
strategy consisted of varying substituent identity at the 1- and
3-positions of the propylene bridge of 3,4-propylenedioxythio-
phene (ProDOT) as a means to manipulate the steric
contributions that enables full visible spectrum tuning and
subsequently the ﬁnal color of electropolymerized homopol-
ymers.26,27 Our group’s approach involved developing a
solution-processable copolymer synthesized via palladium-
catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling polymerizations using Pro-
DOT and phenylene comonomers (ProDOT-Ph).28 This
polymer has a maximum absorbance (λmax) of 455 nm and
the ability to rapidly switch between colored to transmissive
states. However, while this copolymer possessed the necessary
optical properties, ProDOT-Ph had a relatively high oxidation
potential of 1.1 V versus Ag/Ag+ due to the increased
aromaticity of the phenylene comonomer compared to
dioxythiophene. The high oxidation potential, in combination
with accessible reactive sites on the unsubstituted phenylene
comonomer, led to poor redox stability after 10−20 redox
cycles. In an eﬀort to circumvent these stability issues while
achieving a transmissive oxidized state, yellow ECPs were
further developed by using various arylene comonomers and
methoxy-substituted phenylene building blocks.29−31 Introduc-
ing the electron-donating groups on the arylene units yielded
high-gap copolymers with lower oxidation potentials and led to
a slight increase in redox stability. Speciﬁcally, the redox
stability of ﬁlms improved by withstanding degradation for
more than 100 cycles compared to the 10−20 cycles observed
for PProDOT-Ph. However, increasing the stability of these
high-gap systems beyond 100 redox cycles is still paramount
due to the superior redox stability of other ECPs that are used
in blending studies. Overcoming limitations of redox stability
of yellow ECP sets the precedent to explore diﬀerent polymer
structures and synthesize high-gap ECPs without phenylene-
based comonomers.32
An alternative strategy for accessing high-gap ECPs involved
utilizing acyclic dioxythiophene polymers (PAcDOTs) that
were functionalized with branched alkoxy solubilizing chains
and copolymerized with 3,4-dimethoxythiophene or ethyl-
enedioxythiophene.33−35 The PAcDOT-based polymers repre-
sented a new class of orange and red ECPs that exhibit λmax
values between 485 and 525 nm while maintaining relatively
low onsets of oxidation due to the electron-donating nature of
the oxygen atom adjacent to the thiophene backbone. This
work was advantageous beyond the seminal work on red
electrochromics based on substituted thiophenes36 and has
since motivated other research groups to realize diverse
strategies to access conjugated polymers in the same color
space, culminating in red ECPs being synthesized with
benzotriazole,37 phenanthrocarbazole,38 indacenodithio-
phene,12,39 and thienothiophene40 building blocks. However,
these systems suﬀer from poor electrochromic contrast or
exhibit colored-to-colored electrochromic properties and are
not suited for transmissive electrochromic applications. More
recently, our group synthesized a family of copolymers utilizing
a dialkylthiophene (DAT) comonomer coupled with various
dioxythiophene comonomers.41 DAT-based copolymers rep-
resent the ﬁrst family of high-gap ECPs without utilizing
phenylene-based comonomers, while also possessing improved
redox stability, as evident by minimal changes in contrast over
1000 redox cycles. The octyl-solubilizing side chains on the
DAT comonomer provided the intraring strain required to
absorb ∼350 to ∼600 nm and protected the polymer backbone
from undesired side reactions, while the dioxythiophene
comonomers provided adequate redox activity to switch the
polymers at low oxidation potentials (<1.0 V vs Ag/Ag+).
Ultimately, various orange- and red-to-transmissive ECPs were
obtained, highlighting the ability to access various hues in the
high-gap color space using this design strategy. Considering
these successes, we are motivated to further explore the ability
to ﬁne-tune optical and color properties of high-gap ECPs.
In thinking of eﬀective design strategies for high-gap ECPs,
the concept of probing isomeric eﬀects comes to mind due to
the ability to readily introduce compositional and stereoisomer
comonomers into the polymer repeat unit, as illustrated by the
repeat unit structures in Scheme 1. Motivated by the successes
realized by our group, and by Sotzing and co-workers, using
1,3-ProDOTs, we were intrigued to further understand how
subtle changes in comonomer structures, speciﬁcally the role of
stereo- and compositional isomers, can be further exploited to
ﬁne-tune optical and electrochemical properties of high-gap
ECPs. The desire to investigate isomer eﬀects on redox-active
copolymers is further motivated by extensive work on
manipulating the backbone and side-chain structures of
conjugated polymers used for myriad applications, such as
organic ﬁeld eﬀect transistors, organic photovoltaics, and
sensing applications.42−61 With respect to dioxythiophenes,
stereo- and regio-speciﬁcity is less understood, but preliminary
studies indicate these structural features should not be

forsaken. Bäuerle and co-workers demonstrated that fully
stereoregular poly(EDOTs), synthesized via electrochemical
polymerization, possessed improved interchain interactions
and lower onsets of oxidation. However, a thorough
investigation into these eﬀects on optical properties was not
performed.62,63 In another study published as this manuscript
was being drafted, Gidron and co-workers demonstrated the
use of electronic circular dichroism as an analytical technique
that provides insights into chiroptic properties and ﬁlm
morphology that is dependent on electrochemical condi-
tions.64 Regiospeciﬁcity is known to be a useful design strategy
to inﬂuence solution and solid-state properties of dioxythio-
phene polymers. This dependence was demonstrated by a
phenylenedioxythiophene homopolymer that exhibits signiﬁ-
cant inter- and intrachain interactions in solution and the solid-
state that lead to well-deﬁned 2D self-assembled nanostruc-
tures.65 Furthermore, ProDOT possesses a C2 symmetry,
which allows for regiosymmetric polymers to be synthesized
with new optical and electrochemical properties compared to
poly(EDOTs).66,67 Considering the structural diversity envi-
sioned for functionalizing ProDOTs68,69 at various positions of
the propylene bridge, there is a precedent to elucidate isomeric
eﬀects on structure−property-relationships of high-gap ECPs.
Along these lines, herein, we correlate stereo- and composi-
tional isomeric eﬀects on the optical and electrochemical
properties of high-gap ECPs by combining experimental and
theoretical approaches. By changing methyl-substitution
patterns from the 1,3-positions to the 2,2-positions of the
propylene bridge of a ProDOT comonomer, the UV−vis
absorbance of the resulting ﬁlms evolve from featureless
absorbance proﬁles for the 1,3-ProDOT copolymers to spectra
with absorbances spanning >200 nm in breadth with ﬁne-
structure features at longer wavelengths for the 2,2-ProDOT
copolymers. Structural intricacies are further probed by
synthesizing a stereospeciﬁc 1,3-dimethylProDOT comonomer
that is incorporated into a DAT-co-ProDOT copolymer. Upon
characterization, introducing stereospeciﬁcity to the polymer
backbone induces surprising electromagnetic shielding eﬀects
in 1H NMR spectra, measurable diﬀerences in the UV−vis
absorbance spectra of thin ﬁlms, and quantiﬁable diﬀerences in
the resulting colorimetry. A family of 2,2-ProDOTs is
synthesized, where the functionality was varied by methyl,
ethyl, and isobutyl substituents, and is successfully incorpo-
rated into DAT-based copolymers. Each of these polymers
display signiﬁcant broadening and increased ﬁne-structure
absorbance features in their UV−vis absorbance spectra after
electrochemical conditioning, which translates to the neutral
polymers possessing hues of red. While the minimal structural
changes at the 2,2-positions did not drastically inﬂuence the
absorbance proﬁles or the color of the resulting ﬁlms,
increasing the bulkiness of the substituent increased the
propensity of the ﬁlm to maintain its red hue after repeated
electrochemical switching. Ultimately, this study demonstrates
the importance of understanding polymer properties as a
function of the structure by highlighting how subtle diﬀerences
of compositional isomers within a polymer backbone
inﬂuences fundamental structural, optical, and color properties.

■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To elucidate the inﬂuence that compositional isomers have on
the excited state transitions of the resulting alternating
copolymers, time-dependent density functional theory (TD-
DFT) calculations were performed. The mPW1PBE functional
paired with the cc-PVDZ basis set on model systems
possessing 6 aryl groups have proven to accurately correlate
calculated and experimental absorbance spectra, as well as the
resulting color of ECPs.70 The impact of substituent number,
location and orientation on spectra, and therefore color, was
examined by choosing seven oligomers using the legend
provided in Figure 1a. Here, P = ProDOT, R = regiosymetric
2,2-dimethylProDOT, and S = 1,3-dimethylProDOT with the
methyl groups possessing the same stereochemical relationship
with respect to the dioxythiophene reference plane (i.e., syn).
Alternatively, A = 1,3-dimethylProDOT with an alternating
stereochemical relationship (i.e., anti) that represents a mixture
of R,R and S,S stereoisomers at the 1,3-position of the
propylene bridge. Systems possessing diethylthiophene (D)
rings that are alternated with only ProDOT (DPDPDP) and
2,2-DMP (DRDRDR) rings were compared to those paired
with variations of the two 1,3-DMP isomers (DSDSDS,
DSDSDA, DSDADS, DSDADA, and DADADA) (Figure 1c).
For each system, the neutral and radical cation geometries
were optimized and the frequency was veriﬁed. The UV−vis
spectra and the predicted color were generated through a TD-
DFT computation (using mPW1PBE/cc-PVDZ) to ﬁnd the
lowest lying 15 excited states for both neutral and radical
cation forms. A comparison between DPDPDP and DRDRDR
versus the other ﬁve systems resulted in band gap and aryl ring
dihedral angle variances of 0.37 eV and 39°, respectively. (See
Figure S1 for the dihedral angle legend and Table S1 for
corresponding data). These diﬀerences impacted both the
simulated spectra as well as the predicted color for the diﬀerent
systems (Figure 1c and Table S1). The DPDPDP and
DRDRDR oligomers possessed λmax of 495 and 502 nm,
respectively, and indistinguishable oscillator strengths (f) (1.94
for DPDPDP and 1.95 for DRDRDR) culminating in nearly
identical spectra and color for these species (see Table S3 and
Figure 1). The remaining systems were blue-shifted and
possessed a λmax and f range from 427 to 464 nm and 1.65 to
1.80, respectively, thereby giving predicted color diﬀerences
with various orange hues. Unlike the neutral species, the
radical cation set possessed λmax and f deviations of 26 nm and
0.32 (see Table S4), producing comparable simulated spectra
in the visible range. These similarities led to only slight color
diﬀerences between the seven oligomers (see Table S2).
Calculations support the hypothesis that stereo- and
regiospeciﬁcity will inﬂuence the optical properties and
subsequently, the color of neutral polymers, while minimal
change is produced for the radical cation set. Speciﬁcally, the
observed blue-shifts in the calculated absorbance spectra of
each 1,3-ProDOT hexamer motivated our synthetic eﬀorts to
elucidate subtle diﬀerences in neutral colors.
Having identiﬁed regio- and stereospeciﬁc synthetic targets
from our theoretical studies, we began the process of
synthesizing and characterizing monomers and copolymers to
combine experimental and computational results. ProDOT and
DAT comonomers were prepared following our previously
developed synthetic protocols.71 First, ProDOT monomers
were synthesized via transetherﬁcation reactions between 3,4-
methoxythiophene and the corresponding diol in the presence
of p-toluenesulfonic acid in reﬂuxing toluene. Notably, yields
for 2,2-substituted ProDOTs were higher (46−67%) com-
pared to those of 1,3-dimethyl ProDOTs (∼20%) due to the
diﬀerent steric contributions during the ring closing. Synthesis
of the dialkyl-thiophene comonomer was accomplished
following the Kumada cross-coupling procedure reported for
the ﬁrst generation of DAT electrochromic copolymers.41
Detailed procedures, methods, and structural characterization
can be found in the Supporting Information (Figures S2−S7).
Palladium-catalyzed direct heteroarylation polymerization
(DHAP) conditions previously used to synthesize electron-rich
ECPs were followed for the synthesis of each DAT-co-ProDOT
copolymer.72−74 Polymerizations were performed in N,N-
dimethylacetamide at 140 °C using palladium(II) acetate
(Pd(OAc)2) as the catalyst, potassium carbonate (K2CO3) as
the base, and pivalic acid (PivOH) as the proton shuttle. It is
worth noting that attempts using 3,4-bis(octyl)thiophene as
the dihydro comonomer yielded an oligomeric material with
number-average molecular weights (Mn) ∼4.0−7.0 kg/mol as
measured via size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) versus
polystyrene (PS) standards. Historically, dioxythiophene-based
copolymers with Mn values below 10.0 kg/mol neither exhibit
suﬃcient ﬁlm forming properties during processing for
materials with robust redox switching, nor are the polymers
in their limit of conjugation length as needed for saturated
electronic properties.75 This motivated the use of Br2-DAT as
the dibromo comonomer for polymerization protocols, as
shown in Scheme 2. By switching monomer functionality and
the corresponding sequence of participation in the DHAP
catalytic cycle, copolymers using the respective ProDOT as
dihydro comonomers were successfully synthesized. All of the
copolymers were isolated in excellent yields (>80%) with
similar Mn (20−30 kg/mol) and dispersities (D̵ = 2.1−3.6) as
measured by SEC (Figure S8) and are reported in Table 1.
Additionally, as tabulated in Table 1, elemental analyses reveal
each copolymer is obtained with high compositional purity,
which is necessary to establish accurate structure−property
relationships.76−81
Stereoisomer Eﬀects. Structural diﬀerences induced by
the stereospeciﬁcity of 1,3-dimethylProDOTs were inves-
tigated using 1H NMR, and the resulting spectra are illustrated
in Figure 2. Notably, distinct changes in the chemical shifts and
splitting patterns of stereorandom (black trace) and stereo-
speciﬁc (red trace) monomers are measured. The diﬀerence in
chemical shifts for the protons immediately adjacent to the
ProDOT oxygens (4.0 vs 4.4 ppm for the stereorandom and
stereospeciﬁc monomers, respectively) is a result of the
protons being more deshielded in the stereospeciﬁc monomer

compared to the stereorandom monomer. Chemical shifts
∼2.0 ppm correspond to protons at the 2,2-position of the
propylene bridge. The peaks corresponding to a mixture of
stereoisomers in the black trace transition to a single multiplet
in the red trace, which conﬁrms the retention of stereocenters
during the etherﬁcation reaction. When these monomers are
incorporated into copolymers to construct DAT-co-(ran-1,3-
DMP) (blue trace) and DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) (green trace),
the stereospeciﬁc comonomer increases electromagnetic
shielding of protons on the DAT-solubilizing side-chains,
which leads to an upﬁeld shift relative to the copolymer
synthesized with the stereorandom comonomer. These
changes in chemical shifts demonstrate that stereospeciﬁcity
inﬂuences fundamental structural features of the resulting
copolymers and provides the motivation to further probe these
eﬀects on macromolecular properties.
UV−vis absorbance spectra of DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) and
DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) dissolved in toluene were measured to
experimentally explore the eﬀects of stereospeciﬁcity on
polymer optical properties. As depicted in Figure 3a, the
solution UV−vis absorbance proﬁles of both 1,3-DMP
copolymers are identical with maximum absorbances (λmax)
at 440 nm. The measured λmax of the two synthesized 1,3-DMP
copolymers is identical to the calculated λmax of DADADA
(440 nm), which represents DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) and
supports our level of theory. The observed changes in λmax
for other modeled oligomers compared to experimental
measurements demonstrates how minor changes in the
distribution of “stereorandomness” through the polymer
backbone may inﬂuence electronic properties. Diﬀerential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to probe stereospeciﬁc
eﬀects on bulk thermal properties of each copolymer. As
shown in Figure 3b, DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) exhibits melting
and crystallization transitions while DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP)
does not. Previous work on poly(thiophenes) report that
thermal transitions and solid-state architectures were depend-
ent on the critical molecular weight (Mc) with the Mc of P3HT
≈25 kg/mol.82 This molecular weight dependence was
elucidated by observing a linear increase in the melting
temperature (Tm) with increasing Mn, which is attributed to

the chain microstructure evolving from the ability to form
chain-extended crystals to form interconnected “fringe-micelle”
architectures. The diﬀerences in thermal properties exhibited
by DAT-co-ProDOTs is believed to be related to the Mn and
the ability of the copolymers to form crystalline domains. We
speculate the observed transitions for DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP)
(Mn = 18.3 kg/mol) may be attributed to the polymer’s ability
to form chain-extended crystals, while the amorphous nature of
DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) (Mn = 29.1 kg/mol) may indicate
formation of “fringe-micelle” architectures. The thermal
behavior suggests these copolymers possess a Mc between
∼18 and 30 kg/mol and is in agreement with the reported Mc
of P3HT.82 These results are fundamentally intriguing, and
deeper structural studies are required to understand molecular
weight eﬀects on thermal and morphological properties of this
family of copolymers.
To probe the eﬀects of stereospeciﬁcity on optical properties
in the solid state, UV−vis absorbance spectra were measured
for ﬁlms processed via spray-casting onto indium tin oxide
(ITO) electrodes from toluene solutions with concentrations
of 5 mg/mL. Films were sprayed to have transmittance (% T)
values within 2% of each other in an eﬀort to ensure accurate
elucidation of structure−property relationships. UV−vis
absorbance spectra of pristine and electrochemically con-
ditioned ﬁlms of DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) and DAT-co-(reg-
1,3-DMP) are shown in Figure 4a and Table 2. Analogous to
diﬀerences in bulk thermal properties measured with DSC,
UV−vis absorbance spectra of pristine ﬁlms show distinct
diﬀerences. First, DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) as a pristine ﬁlm is

protocols consist of performing 10 CV cycles across a voltage window of −0.5 to 0.8 V (vs Ag/Ag+ reference electrode) in a 0.5 M TBAPF6/PC
electrolyte solution using a scan rate of 100 mV/s.

red-shifted compared to DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) and also
displays a vibronic ﬁne-structure feature ∼525 nm, which is
attributed to the more semicrystalline nature of the copolymer
as observed in, and consistent with, DSC measurements.
Alternatively, pristine ﬁlms of DAT-co-(1,3-reg-DMP) exhibit
broad, featureless absorbance proﬁles and have a blue-shifted
absorbance maximum [∼450 vs ∼500 nm for DAT-co-(reg-
1,3-DMP) and DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP), respectively]. Com-
bined, the diﬀerences observed from DSC and UV−vis
absorbance measurements support the notion of molecular
weight dependence on polymer ordering in pristine ﬁlms. For
example, in our initial studies of DAT-based copolymers,41
DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) was synthesized with a Mn = 25.0 kg/
mol (vs PS standards using CHCl3 as the eluent) and displayed
a broad, featureless absorbance proﬁle. The broad, featureless
absorbance spectrum is in contrast to DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP)
synthesized for this study (Mn = 18.3 kg/mol) but analogous
to DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) (Mn = 29.1 kg/mol), which
provides evidence that the polymers with Mn ≥25 kg/mol
are amorphous, while polymers below this molecular weight
threshold have a minimal amount of order detectable with
UV−vis spectroscopy.
After comparing the optical properties of the 1,3-DMP
copolymers as pristine ﬁlms, they were subjected to repeated
redox reactions, known as electrochemical conditioning. This
“electrochemical annealing” protocol is necessary as con-
jugated polymers often display changes in their redox response
and absorbance features due to microstructural reorganization
after doping and dedoping with exposure to solvent and ions.83
Electrochemical conditioning protocols consist of performing
10 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles across a voltage window of
−0.5 to 0.8 V (vs Ag/Ag+ reference electrode) in a 0.5 M
TBAPF6/PC electrolyte solution using a scan rate of 100 mV/
s. After conditioning, DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) displays a blue-
shift compared to the pristine ﬁlm and the ﬁne-structure
feature is no longer visible. This blue shift suggests that the
stereorandom copolymer becomes more disordered in the
solid-state upon electrochemical annealing and agrees with our
preliminary report on DAT-based copolymers.41 Typically, the
eﬀective conjugation length of redox-active conjugated
polymers is extended upon electrochemical conditioning and
is ultimately accompanied with a red-shift in the absorbance
spectrum.66,67,84 Alternatively, after 10 CV cycles, the stereo-
speciﬁc copolymer DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) exhibits a slight
red-shift in the absorbance maximum and the evolution of a
new transition at ∼600 nm is observed, ostensibly due to the
evolution of aggregates. While there are noticeable diﬀerences
in the absorbance proﬁles observed between pristine and
conditioned ﬁlms, absorbance maxima values are identical for
DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) and DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) (see
Table 2.). These ﬁndings highlight that while molecular weight
may aﬀect ordering and absorbance proﬁles of pristine ﬁlms,
electrochemical conditioning eliminates these inﬂuences.
Cyclic voltammetric results in Figure 4b illustrates that after
electrochemical conditioning DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) has an
onset of oxidation ∼0.0 V versus Ag/Ag+ while the onset of
oxidation for DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) is ∼−0.1 V. These slight
diﬀerences in the onset of oxidation, with the stereospeciﬁc
copolymer displaying a slightly lower current onset, are
consistent with the trends reported by Bäuerle indicating
that ProDOT stereospeciﬁcity does inﬂuence the redox
properties of these copolymers.62 Speciﬁcally, the lower
onset of oxidation of DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP), in addition to
the red-shifted UV−vis absorbance spectrum after electro-
chemical annealing, indicates the stereospeciﬁc copolymers
have improved interchain interactions compared to DAT-co-
(ran-1,3-DMP).
The changes in absorbance as a function of electrochemical
potential from −0.5 to 0.8 V were evaluated for electrochemi-
cally conditioned ﬁlms of the stereorandom and stereospeciﬁc
copolymers spray cast onto ITO electrodes from toluene. As
shown in Figure 5, at ∼0−0.1 V, which corresponds to the
onset of oxidation for the copolymers measured by CV, the

neutral state absorbance in the visible region of the
electromagnetic spectrum begins to decrease in intensity.
This decrease in absorbance is accompanied with the
formation of cation radicals (polarons) ∼800 nm.85,86 As the
electrochemical potential is increased further, absorbance in
the visible region and ∼800 nm is depleted, while absorbance
corresponding to the formation of dications (bipolarons) is
observed beyond 1400 nm. These trends indicate that both
copolymers transition from a vibrant orange ﬁlm in the neutral
state to a highly transmissive ﬁlm when completely oxidized.
Additionally, as shown in Figure 6, the absorbance intensity for
DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) and DAT-co-(reg-1,3-ProDOT) be-
gins to diminish at their respective onsets of oxidation and
demonstrate relatively uniform doping mechanisms with 50
mV increases in electrochemical potential. The steady
depletion of absorbance observed in the spectroelectrochem-
ical experiments indicates stereospeciﬁcity does not signiﬁ-
cantly inﬂuence steric interactions that impact nonplanar to
planar transitions that occurs upon chemical doping.33,87,88
The diﬀerences observed in the UV−vis absorbance spectra
ultimately inﬂuence the perceived color of the electrochromic
ﬁlms. Therefore, colorimetric analysis of the polymer ﬁlms
based on the “Commision Internationale de l’Eclairage 1976
L*a*b* color standards was used to quantify the eﬀect of
comonomer stereospeciﬁcity on the perceived color of DAT-
co-(ran-1,3-DMP) and DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP). Colorimetry
data illustrated in Figure 7 and tabulated in Table 3 indicate
both copolymers fall in the orange color space and reach highly
transmissive oxidized states with increasing electrochemical
potential. In Figure 7, the color coordinates for the pristine
ﬁlms are identiﬁed by the circled data points, and upon
electrochemical conditioning move to the points indicated by
black arrows, and with continued 50 mV electrochemical steps,
follow the path of the curved arrows tracking toward the
graph’s origin. Diﬀerences in the quantiﬁed color of the two
copolymer ﬁlms arise from slight variations in the a* and L*
values. DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) has a slightly larger a* value
(∼33) compared to the a* value measured for DAT-co-(ran-
1,3-DMP) (∼27). The measured color coordinates are in good
agreement with DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) having a slightly red-
shifted absorbance spectrum compared to DAT-co-(ran-1,3-
DMP) in Figure 4a, and thus, the ﬁlm has a larger “red”
component to the perceived color (i.e., larger a*). As the
electrochemical potential is increased and absorbance across
the wavelength range 380−780 nm decreases, a* and b* values
decrease and progress toward the plots’ origin. The
progression of the data across the third quadrant is a result
of the tailing absorbance at longer wavelengths of the visible
region before being depleted such that both copolymers
demonstrate small a* and b* values (<−1 and ∼2,
respectively) as well as L* values >85. Combined, these
results indicate the polymers reach a highly transmissive, color-
neutral oxidized state.
Redox and color stability of the DAT copolymers were
performed by applying square-wave potential steps from −0.5
to 0.6 V versus Ag/Ag+ to switch the ﬁlms under an argon (Ar)
atmosphere, where both copolymers demonstrate redox
stability over the course of 500 switching cycles (Figure S9).
It is important to note these experiments did demonstrate a
dependence on the oxidizing potential. When voltages
exceeded 0.6 V (vs Ag/Ag+), signiﬁcant ﬁlm degradation
(>50% of the optical contrast) was observed within 100
switching cycles. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 8a,b, the
stereospeciﬁcity inﬂuences the long-term color stability. Here,
color stability is deﬁned as the ability of a polymer ﬁlm to
maintain its color after repeated electrochemical cycling and is
calculated using the quantitative diﬀerence in color according
to eq S1. Speciﬁcally, as shown in Figure 8a, DAT-co-(ran-1,3-
DMP) exhibits only minimal change in the measured UV−vis
absorbance spectrum after 500 redox cycles. Alternatively,
DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) (Figure 8b) shows a decrease in the
π−π* transition, and the onset shoulder at ∼600 nm continues
to evolve. Changes in the absorbance spectra after extended
electrochemical switching lead to diﬀerences in the quantita-
tive diﬀerence in color, ΔEab*, which is calculated according to
eq S1. A ΔEab* value larger than 2.3 means that two colors are
noticeably diﬀerent to the human eye. As shown in Table S5,

the quantiﬁed diﬀerence in color DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) after
500 electrochemical switching cycles is 1.5, which indicates
that the minimal changes in the UV−vis absorbance spectrum
do not lead to noticeable diﬀerences in color. Alternatively,
due to the decrease in the π−π* transition of DAT-co-(reg-1,3-
DMP) accompanied with the increased intensity of the
transition ∼600 nm, the quantiﬁed color diﬀerence of DAT-
co-(reg-1,3-DMP) is calculated as 9.0. Furthermore, the
quantiﬁed color diﬀerences are supported with photography,
where in Figure S10, DAT-co-(reg-1,3-DMP) evolves to a
shade of brown, while DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP) maintains its
orange hue with a slight decrease in saturation. The evolution
of the absorbance proﬁles upon repeated electrochemical
switching, and ultimately, changes in the ﬁlm color, suggest
that the polymer chain conformation that DAT-co-(reg-1,3-
DMP) adopts in the solid state is less stable compared to
DAT-co-(ran-1,3-DMP). The cause of this instability may be
molecular weight eﬀects or introduction of stereospeciﬁcity
into the polymer backbone. At present, we are unable to
identify the driving factor behind this observation, which
further motivates the structural studies proposed previously in
the manuscript.
The switching rate of the 1,3-DMP copolymers was studied
by monitoring the change in transmittance (ΔT (%)) at the
maximum absorbance wavelength as a function of time by
applying square-wave potential steps (−0.5 to 0.6 V vs Ag/Ag+
in 0.5 M TBAPF6/PC) to polymer ﬁlms spray-cast onto ITO
electrodes for a range from 0.25 to 10 s. Details regarding the
area and resistance of the electrodes are provided in the
Supporting Information. As shown in Figure S11 and Table 3,
at switching times above 2 s, both polymers exhibit ΔT (%)
values from 66 to 70%. As the switching time is decreased to
0.25 s, the ΔT (%) values also decrease, as expected. This
trend is indicative of both copolymers being rapid switching
materials and is quantiﬁed by the time it takes both copolymers
to reach 95% of a full contrast switch (t95). As shown in Table
3, both copolymers exhibit bleaching times ∼1 s and coloration
times ∼1.0−1.3 s. Furthermore, Table 3 shows that the
standardized switching time (τ), which is obtained by ﬁtting
the data in Figure S11 to an exponential expression that
correlates optical contrast with the time needed to obtain it,89
is similar regardless of stereospeciﬁcity. The similar ΔT (%),
t95, and τ values for these DAT-based copolymers are an
indication that, although optical and color properties are
inﬂuenced by stereospeciﬁcity, properties such as contrast and
switching times are minimally aﬀected.
Regioisomer and 2,2-Functionality Eﬀects. While
electrochromic properties, such as contrast and switching
times, were minimally inﬂuenced by stereospeciﬁcity, the
observed diﬀerences of optical properties, color, and color
stability motivated us to further probe isomeric eﬀects on
additional ECPs. Subsequently, a family of ProDOT
copolymers 2,2-functionalized with methyl (DMP), ethyl
(DEP), and isobutyl (DiBP) groups were synthesized as a
means to probe compositional isomer eﬀects. First, as shown in
Figure S12 and tabulated in Table 4, all three DAT-co-(2,2-
ProDOT)s exhibit broad featureless absorbance proﬁles in
toluene solutions with λmax values between 419 and 426 nm.
Next, ﬁlms were spray-cast from 5 mg/mL toluene solutions
and UV−vis absorbance spectra were measured. As shown in
Figure 9a, as pristine ﬁlms, these copolymers exhibit broad,
featureless absorbance proﬁles with λmax values from 486 to

497 nm. Upon electrochemical conditioning with 10 CV cycles
from −0.5 to 0.8 V versus Ag/Ag+ in 0.5 M TBAPF6, all three
2,2-ProDOT copolymers exhibit distinct red-shifts and broader
absorbance spectra that include ﬁne-structure absorbance
features ∼550 and ∼600 nm when compared to 1,3-ProDOTs
copolymers in Figure 4a. Notably, these copolymers maintain

absorbance in the high-energy region of the visible spectrum
analogous to 1,3-ProDOTs but exhibit the ﬁne-structure
features of unsubstituted DAT-co-ProDOT.41 The observed
ﬁne-structure features suggest the 2,2-ProDOTs possess a
higher degree of ordering in the electrochemically conditioned
ﬁlms compared to 1,3-ProDOTs and facilitate improved
cofacial π-stacking and interchain absorbance contributions
commonly observed for polythiophenes.90
The electrochemical properties of the 2,2-ProDOT copoly-
mers are illustrated in Figure 9b and reported in Table 4. As
pristine ﬁlms, all three polymers display onsets of oxidation
between ∼0.3 and 0.4 V, as well as similar current densities and
CV shapes. After electrochemical conditioning, as depicted by
the solid lines, each CV trace is nearly identical with respect to
shape and current density (∼0.2 mA/cm2) when ﬁlms are
processed to a transmittance (%T) ≈10−15%. These
similarities indicate that, regardless of the choice of
functionality within this family, the underlying morphologies
do not aﬀect the accessible redox active sites in the polymer
ﬁlm and ultimately, the redox capacity of the ﬁlms. The only
variation observed was in the case of DAT-co-DiBP, which has
a higher onset of oxidation (∼0.2 V vs Ag/Ag+) after
conditioning compared to an onset of oxidation ∼−0.1 V
versus Ag/Ag+ for DAT-co-DMP and DAT-co-DEP. The
diﬀerences in onsets of oxidation is an unusual observation
considering the onset of absorbance and general proﬁles of the
absorbance spectra are nearly identical. Combined, these
results suggest the branched iso-butyl groups inhibit eﬃcient
electron transfer at the polymer/electrode interface, which has
been demonstrated to be side chain-dependent in dioxythio-
phene copolymers.91
The changes in absorbance as a function of electrochemical
potential from −0.5 to 0.8 V versus Ag/Ag+ were evaluated for
the DAT-co-(2,2-ProDOT) copolymers spray-cast onto ITO
electrodes from 5 mg/mL toluene solutions. As shown in
Figure 10, the absorbance of neutral DAT-co-DMP and DAT-
co-DEP begins to decrease ∼−0.1 V versus Ag/Ag+, while
DAT-co-DiBP begins to decrease at ∼0.2 V, correlating with
their oxidation onset. As the applied voltage is increased in 50
mV steps, the absorbance shoulders ∼550 and ∼600 nm
decrease in intensity and the formation of polarons ∼900 nm is
observed. With continued increase in the electrochemical
potential, all three polymer ﬁlms demonstrate a complete
depletion of absorbance in the visible spectrum and form
bipolaronic species >1400 nm. The diminished absorbance
indicates that all three polymers transition from a colored
neutral state to a highly transmissive ﬁlm when oxidized above
0.6 V versus Ag/Ag+.
Turning to colorimetry results, as shown in Figure 11,
pristine ﬁlms of all of the polymers are a vibrant yellow color.
Upon electrochemical conditioning, the ﬁlms undergo a
distinct color change, yielding similar hues of red electro-
chromes. This observed color change agrees with the drastic
“break-in” eﬀect observed in the UV−vis spectra depicted in
Figure 9. As observed in Figure 11 and tabulated in Table 5,
the conditioned 2,2-ProDOT copolymers exhibit similar a*
values (42−53), where variations among these values are
attributed to diﬀerences in the transmittance of the ﬁlms.
Analogously, b* and L* values also are similar, which indicates
the minimal changes to the 2,2-functionality does not have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the color properties. The ability to
access these red hues is attributed to the breadth of the
absorbance proﬁles spanning >200 nm (400−625 nm) across
the visible spectrum. As shown in Figure 11, each 2,2-ProDOT
copolymer transitions from a colored ﬁlm in the neutral state
to a highly transmissive ﬁlm with increasing oxidation potential
with a* and b* values decreasing to values less than 5,
respectively, as well as L* values >85. Combined, and as shown
by the photographs, these values indicate the polymers reach a
highly transmissive, color-neutral oxidized state.
As previously alluded to, and visualized in the photographs
of Figure 11, diﬀerences in the transmittance of these ﬁlms
inﬂuence how saturated the red color is perceived by the
human eye. These subtle changes led us to quantify these
eﬀects using colorimetry and photography. First, as shown in
Figure 12a, DAT-co-ProDOT appears pink when spray-cast to
a transmittance of ∼15% with a* and b* values ∼60 and ∼15,
respectively. As the transmittance of the ﬁlms is decreased,
ultimately to ∼2% for the photograph highlighted in the blue
box, a highly saturated red ﬁlm is obtained with a* and b*
values ∼80 and ∼50, respectively. Regardless of the trans-
mittance, DAT-co-ProDOT transitions from a colored ﬁlm in
the neutral state to a highly transmissive ﬁlm when oxidized,
while maintaining the ability to rapidly switch between the
colored and transmissive state (Figure S13). Furthermore, as
shown in Figure 12b, when DAT-co-DiBP is spray cast to a
transmittance ∼3%, a* and b* values ∼65 and ∼60 are
measured, respectively, and photography reveals a highly
saturated red ﬁlm. To further analyze the quantiﬁcation of
these red electrochromes, color coordinates of “thick” ﬁlms of
DAT-co-ProDOT and DAT-co-DiBP are plotted alongside
Munsell color points in Figure 12b, where the wedge between
2.5R and 7.5R is deﬁned as an acceptable “red” region by the
Munsell Color System,40 and 5R is considered “pure red”. The
color coordinates for DAT-co-ProDOT fall between the 5R
and 7.5R lines, and the accompanying photography validates
the deﬁned red region. Alternatively, color coordinates of
DAT-co-DiBP fall slightly outside of the red wedge, which is
attributed to the increased absorbance from 380 to ∼450 nm

measured for the 2,2-ProDOT copolymers compared to DAT-
co-ProDOT. The increased absorbance between 380 and 450
nm translates to DAT-co-DiBP possessing a slight orange hue
compared to DAT-co-ProDOT.
While 2,2-functionality has yielded only minimal diﬀerences
in the fundamental optical, electrochemical, and color
properties of DAT-co-(2,2-ProDOTs), signiﬁcant changes
reveal themselves after repeated electrochemical cycling (500
redox cycles) between −0.5 and 0.6 V versus Ag/Ag+ in 0.5 M
TBAPF6/PC electrolyte under an Ar atmosphere. While each
polymer displays electrochemical stability over the course of
the experiments (Figure 13a), the optical, and ultimately color
properties, show a strong dependence on 2,2-substitution.
First, Figure 13b shows DAT-co-DMP exhibits a distinct red-
shift in the absorbance pattern as well as further evolution of
vibronic ﬁne-structure features in the UV−vis absorbance
spectrum. When the 2,2-substituent is changed to ethyl groups
(Figure 13c), changes in the absorbance spectrum are reduced,
but distinct diﬀerences are still observed. In the case of DAT-
co-DiBP, the absorbance spectrum is essentially unchanged
after 500 electrochemical redox cycles (Figure 13d). These
results suggest that DAT-co-DiBP is in a more stable
conformation in the solid state after initial electrochemical
conditioning protocols compared to DAT-co-DMP and DAT-
co-DEP and maintains this stability after repeated electro-
chemical cycles. The changes in the absorbance spectra are
further quantiﬁed by calculating the quantiﬁed color change
(ΔEab*) between electrochemically conditioned ﬁlms and ﬁlms
that have been switched with 500 redox cycles. The ΔEab*
calculated for the DAT-co-(2,2-ProDOT) copolymers are
tabulated in Table S6 and follow the trend of decreasing
ΔEab* with increasing substituent bulk at the 2,2-position of the
propylene bridge. The changes measured in the UV−vis results
in DAT-co-DMP and DAT-co-DEP having a visibly diﬀerent
color, while DAT-co-DiBP demonstrates superior color
stability (ΔEab* = 1.8) not detectable by the human eye after
extensive electrochemical switching. Ultimately, these experi-
ments reveal how subtle structural changes to the 2,2-position
of ProDOT comonomers inﬂuence the long-term color
switching properties of high-gap electrochromic copolymers.
The switching rate of the 2,2-functionalized copolymers was
studied by monitoring the change in transmittance (ΔT (%))
at the maximum absorbance wavelength as a function of time
by applying square-wave potential steps (−0.5 to 0.6 V vs Ag/
Ag+ in 0.5 M TBAPF6/PC) to polymer ﬁlms spray-cast onto
ITO electrodes for a range from 0.25 to 10 s. As shown in
Figure S14 and Table 5, at switching times above 2 s, the 2,2-
functionalized copolymers exhibit ΔT (%) values ∼65%.
Analogous to 1,3-functionalized copolymers, the 2,2-function-
alized copolymers are rapidly switching materials and is
conﬁrmed by the time it takes all three copolymers to reach
95% of a full contrast switch (t95). Speciﬁcally, all three
copolymers exhibit bleaching and coloration times ∼1 s (see
Table 5). Notably, as the substituent bulk is increased at the
2,2-position of the propylene bridge, the standardized
switching time, τ, slightly decreases. This trend is in agreement
with previous studies demonstrating that increasing the size of
the solubilizing side chain at the 2,2-position of the propylene
bridge improves the switching kinetics of ProDOT polymers.67
The similar ΔT (%) and t95 values, in addition to modest
diﬀerences of τ values for these DAT-based copolymers,
indicates that subtle diﬀerences of the 2,2-functionality
minimally inﬂuences properties such as contrast and switching
times.

■CONCLUSIONS
Understanding how subtle structural features inﬂuence optical
and electrochemical properties of redox-active conjugated
ECPs is essential for establishing design motifs to ﬁne-tune
application-inspired properties, such as color control in
electrochromism. This study expands this understanding to
encompass the inﬂuence of compositional isomers on color
control of high-gap ECPs. TD-DFT calculations lend credence
to the hypothesis that subtle changes in stereospeciﬁcity and
substitution pattern across the propylene bridge of ProDOT
comonomers yield distinct shifts in calculated absorbance
spectra and color. Guided by computation, stereo- and
regiospeciﬁc copolymers were synthesized via direct arylation
polymerization to yield a family of electrochromic copolymers
in the orange/red color space that transition from deeply
colored ﬁlms in the neutral state to highly transmissive ﬁlms
with an applied electrochemical potential. Notably, the entire
family of DAT-based copolymers exhibit excellent contrast and
kinetic switching times (ΔT (%) ≈65% and t95 ≈1 s,
respectively), regardless of substitution pattern within the
alternating copolymers. By elucidating these structural
inﬂuences, this study will be used to guide the future design
of conjugated polymers that are useful in redox-active
applications, especially ﬁne-tuning color control of ECPs.
