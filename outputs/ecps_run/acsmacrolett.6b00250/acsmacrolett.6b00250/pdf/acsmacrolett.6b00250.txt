ABSTRACT: The ﬁrst example of a solution processable dioxythio-
phene-alt-dioxyselenophene polymer, ProDOT-EDOS, prepared via
direct (hetero)arylation polymerization is reported and its optical and
electrochemical properties are compared to the all thiophene analog,
ProDOT-EDOT, and other relevant dioxythiophene polymers. By
substituting the sulfur atom for a selenium atom on one of the
monomers in the repeat unit a signiﬁcant red-shift of both the neutral
(41 nm, 132 meV) and polaronic (106 nm, 126 meV) absorbances
results, as well as a 160 mV reduction in the onset of oxidation
compared to ProDOT-EDOT. Spray-cast ﬁlms of the polymer
electrochemically switch from a vibrant blue charge neutral state to a
color neutral and highly transmissive oxidized state.
P
olyselenophenes have received attention in the ﬁeld of
organic electronics due to their similarities and diﬀerences
to the more widely studied polythiophenes, where they possess
reduced aromatic character, leading to increased quinoidal
character and planarity between rings and yielding lower
electronic band-gaps.1−4 Of particular note is the computational
and experimental work of the late Michael Bendikov on
selenophene oligomers and polymers who developed extensive
selenophene chemistry and made important comparisons with
structurally similar thiophene-based polymers.1,5−9 Recently,
poly(3-alkylselenophenes) and copolymers containing 3-
alkylselenophenes10−12 along with other selenophene contain-
ing polymers have found use as both organic ﬁeld-eﬀect
transistor (OFET)13−15 and organic photovoltaic (OPV)16,17
materials with enhanced transport properties due to more
extensive interchain interactions compared to their thiophene
analogs.
In a similar comparison, electrochemically polymerized 3,4-
alkylenedioxyselenophenes (XDOSs) and their analogous 3,4-
alkylenedioxythiophenes (XDOTs) have been investigated and
compared as redox active and electrochromic (EC) materials.
This is illustrated in PProDOS, which exhibits a saturated blue
hue due to a distinct red-shift4,18 of the neutral polymer’s π →
π* transition relative to the more purple color observed for the
PProDOTs.19,20 A red-shifted absorption of the PProDOS
cation-radical (polaron state) relative to that observed for
PProDOT moves the charged material’s absorption of light
more fully into the near-infrared.20 These PXDOS materials
have low oxidation potentials (as low as −0.95 V vs Ag/AgCl),6
which is of particular use in EC and electrochemical charge
storage devices, such as supercapacitors. For the PXDOS family
of materials to become more attractive and useful for redox and
organic electronic applications, it is necessary to move beyond
electrochemical polymerizations with the preparation and
processing of soluble polymers. To date, there is one example
of a PProDOS functionalized with solubilizing side chains that
has been electropolymerized to yield a low molecular weight
product (7.2−9.3 kDa), which could subsequently be spray cast
from a dichloromethane (DCM) solution.19 During the
preparation of this manuscript, the dehalogenative polymer-
ization of dihalo XDOS and XDOT monomers were reported,
yielding soluble oligomers with a low molecular weight (5
kDa), but no polymeric materials were presented.21
Direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP) has
emerged as one of the most practical and versatile polymer-
ization methods for the synthesis of conjugated polymers.22−24
DHAP has been previously utilized to synthesize a large
number of dioxythiophene-based polymers and copolymers for
high contrast electrochromic25,26 and charge storage applica-
tions27 and here, for the ﬁrst time, this chemistry has been
extended to XDOS-based polymers. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst
synthesis of an alternating ProDOT-EDOS copolymer,
applying standard DHAP conditions, is reported with EDOS
serving as the dihydrogen species and a ProDOT derivative
with 2-hexyldecyloxy solubilizing chains as the dihalide to yield
ProDOT-EDOS, as illustrated in Figure 1a. The polymer was
puriﬁed via Soxhlet extraction and the repeat unit structure
conﬁrmed using elemental analysis and NMR (Figure S1), as
outlined in the Supporting Information. The molecular weight
of the polymer (Mn = 12.5 kDa, Đ = 1.6) was determined via

gel permeation chromatography (GPC) relative to polystyrene
standards. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of a dropcast ﬁlm of the
polymer on a glassy carbon electrode exhibited a low onset of
oxidation followed by a broad electrochemical response, as
shown in Figure 1b. This onset of oxidation is lower than both
the PProDOT homopolymer and the ProDOT-EDOT
alternating polymer. This is consistent with the low oxidation
potential reported in the literature for electropolymerized
XDOS polymers and is conﬁrmed by diﬀerential pulse
voltammograms (DPVs), as shown in Figure S2, where
ProDOT-EDOS shows a reduction in the onset of oxidation
of 160 mV relative to ProDOT-EDOT simply by changing one
of the heteroatoms in the repeat unit from sulfur to selenium.

When spray cast from a chloroform solution (4 mg/mL)
onto ITO glass, the resulting ProDOT-EDOS ﬁlm appears as a
slightly muted blue ﬁlm (L*a*b* = 53, 1, −45). However, it
can be seen in Figure 2a and S3a that following an
electrochemical break-in with 5 CV cycles the neutral form of
the ﬁlm is converted to a deep blue color (L*a*b* = 53, −4,
−47). Upon oxidation of the polymer the blue color disappears
and a colorless and transmissive state (L*a*b* = 92, −3, −3) is
formed, as seen in Figure 2a. The spectroelectrochemical series
of the ﬁlm in Figures 2b and S3b allows us to observe the
gradual oxidation of the polymer and the depletion of the
charge neutral state as polarons are formed, followed by
bipolarons, and ultimately bipolaron band formation28,29 with
complete disappearance of the neutral state absorption by 0.8
V.
The UV−vis-NIR absorbance proﬁles of PProDOT,
ProDOT-EDOT, and ProDOT-EDOS shown in Figure 3a
demonstrate a red-shift in both peak and onset of absorbance
for this family of polymers. Insertion of the less sterically
encumbering EDOT in alternation with ProDOT leads to a
relaxation of the torsional angles along the polymer backbone,
as demonstrated previously in studies directed to color tuning
in EC polymers (ECPs).26 With the subsequent substitution of
the sulfur atom for a selenium atom in the EDOS repeat unit, a
further 41 nm red-shift in peak absorbance is observed (Table
1). Using the energy for the onset of the π →π* transition in
the polymer as an estimation of the optical bandgap, we see a
decrease from 1.97 to 1.77 eV and, ﬁnally, to 1.62 eV across this
series. Tracking the hue and saturation of the ﬁlms during
oxidation, the colorimetry results in Figure 3b, Figure S4, and
Table 1 show how the materials transition from deeply colored
states to highly transmissive, near neutral hued forms. The a* =
−4 value for ProDOT-EDOS is unusual, as it does not contain
a red component as we typically see in blue XDOT ECPs
(speciﬁcally in ProDOT-EDOT2 and PEDOT), which have
small positive a* values.26,27 As the polymer is oxidized, the
colorimetry results track the b* axis relatively closely,
minimizing secondary colors observed during electrochemical
switching. This switch is relatively rapid with a 95% switch,
calculated from the chronoabsorptiometry in Figure S5, of 0.60
s.
Interestingly, it can be see in Table 1 that the absorption
maximum of ProDOT-EDOS and PEDOT are similar and the
diﬀerence in bandgap between the two is small (0.04 eV),
suggesting that the materials will appear similar in perceived
color. However, a quantitative comparison of the colorimetry
values of the two polymers show that this is not true and the
materials appear as distinct hues. The color diﬀerence equation
(ΔE*ab) presented in the Supporting Information was used to
compare the colors, thereby determining if they are distinguish-
able to a standard observer.30,31 If the value of ΔE*ab is greater
than 2.2, two colors are distinguishable from each other.
Despite the similarities in peak absorbance and onset,
ProDOT-EDOS and PEDOT have a ΔE*ab value of 24,
meaning that while they are both blue polymers they appear as
distinctly diﬀerent hues of blue. In contrast, ProDOT-EDOT2
(λmax = 613 nm, Eg = 1.71 eV) has a ΔE*ab value of 2.2 relative
to PEDOT, making these two materials indistinguishable to a
standard observer in spite of the larger diﬀerence in peak
absorbance and optical bandgap.27 Comparing these polymers
nicely demonstrates how perceived color is more complex than
the bandgap and peak absorbance, but is dependent on the
overall absorbance proﬁle.
While altering the backbone structure in dioxythiophene
polymers shifts the neutral absorbance, it generally does not
have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the polaronic absorption, which
tends to be found between 780 and 980 nm. This is exempliﬁed
in PProDOT and ProDOT-EDOT with a 50 nm diﬀerence in
the neutral, and a 33 nm diﬀerence in the polaronic peak
absorbance, corresponding to decreases in energy of 188 and 45
meV, respectively. Substitution of the sulfur for selenium on the
EDOT unit leads to a smaller energy reduction of 132 meV (a
41 nm red-shift) in the neutral absorbance and a larger energy
reduction of 126 meV (a 106 nm red-shift) in the polaron
absorption relative to ProDOT-EDOT. By moving the polaron
further into the IR, it may be possible to reduce the extent of
tailing of the charged state absorption into the visible, which
may ultimately increase the EC contrast observed.
Given the large eﬀect that substitution of a selenium atom in
place of sulfur in these structures has on the redox behavior,
neutral state absorbance, and polaron absorbance of the
resulting copolymer, we envision that these dioxyselenophenes
will be of practical use in color mixing of electrochromic
polymers. The XDOS family of polymers can provide the long
wavelength absorbance needed for brown and black blends
without leading to the higher oxidation potential and lower EC
contrast that donor−acceptor ECPs (e.g., ProDOT-alt-
benzothiadiazole) typically exhibit.32 Additionally, the signiﬁ-
cant reduction in oxidation potential and broad electroactive
response make this polymer, and others of its kind, of interest
in charge storage research in both types I and II super-
capacitors.
