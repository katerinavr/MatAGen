ABSTRACT: Copolymerization of alkoxy-functionalized 3,4-propylenedioxy-
thiophenes (ProDOTs) with unfunctionalized 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophenes
(EDOTs) in varying ratios using direct arylation yields a series of solution
processable polymers with highly tunable optical and electronic properties. Within
this series, we have identiﬁed ProDOT−EDOT2, a copolymer containing 67%
EDOT compositionally, that combines the low oxidation potential, the redox
behavior, and the deep-blue neutral color that are characteristic of PEDOT with the
high solubility, exceptional electrochromic contrast, and color neutrality in the
oxidized state characteristic of alkoxy-functionalized PProDOTs.
1. INTRODUCTION
Since its discovery in the 1980s, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-
thiophene) (PEDOT) has become one of the most studied
and used electroactive polymers because of its redox activity,
high conductivity with concurrent visible transmissivity,
accompanying thermal, chemical, and environmental stability,
as well as organic and, to some extent, aqueous electrolyte
compatibility.1,2 Thin ﬁlms of PEDOT have been evaluated for
use in a variety of applications ranging from transistors to
electrolytic capacitors and organic supercapacitors, solar cells,
and antistatic coatings.3−7 In addition, PEDOT was also one of
the ﬁrst cathodically coloring electrochromic polymers, switch-
ing from a deep blue neutral form to a sky-blue transmissive
oxidized form.8,9 In the absence of surfactants or dispersants
(such as polystyrenesulfonate (PSS−)), PEDOT is an insoluble
polymer that must be prepared by either electrochemical
oxidative polymerization or a vapor phase polymerization,
where the properties of the resulting PEDOT ﬁlms are highly
dependent on the precise polymerization conditions and the
structural and molecular weight characterizations are diﬃ-
cult.10−12 Previously, attempts have been made to develop a
soluble version of PEDOT by functionalization of the ethylene
bridge with alkyl chains, but any direct manipulation of the
EDOT unit changes the electrochemical and optical properties
of the resulting polymer as a result of the increased steric bulk
and regioirregularity induced by the solubilizing groups.13,14 To
facilitate solution processing, EDOT is polymerized in the
presence of PSS−or another solubilizing salt to form an
aqueous dispersion (e.g., PEDOT:PSS) which allows these
composites to be deposited by e.g. spin-coating, slot-die
coating, or inkjet printing.1,15−19
While PEDOT:PSS is used eﬀectively in various solid-state
applications where device operation relies on PEDOT
maintaining its oxidation state, electrochemical devices such
as supercapacitors and electrochromic displays rely on
complete and reversible switching between two extreme
redox states for optimal device performance (i.e., complete
charge/discharge in supercapacitors and optimal color contrast
in electrochromic devices). In the presence of an excess of an
immobilized counterion, such as PSS−, PEDOT cannot be fully
reduced to its charge neutral form, limiting its use as an active
material in these electrochemical devices. In addition to
numerous solvent additives or post-treatment methods that
have been evaluated to either remove or segregate the PSS−,
polyethylenimine (PEI) has been used to chemically reduce
PEDOT:PSS for an all-polymer battery application.16,17,20−22
However, even this method was not able to fully remove
polaronic charge carriers from the PEDOT backbone.22
Here, we have designed and prepared soluble dioxythiophene
polymers (Scheme 1) which are electrochemically equivalent
and optically superior to PEDOT with the added advantage of
being highly soluble in organic solvents without having to
structurally modify the EDOT unit or use any additional
surfactants or dispersants. This is achieved by copolymerizing
various ratios of EDOT with alkoxy-functionalized 3,4-
propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) as the solubilizing unit.
Alkoxy-functionalized ProDOT was chosen due to its (i)
electron richness to maintain a low oxidation potential, (ii) ease
of side chain manipulation to tune solubility, and (iii) high

electrochromic contrast and color neutral oxidized state.23 We
show that it is possible to combine these two model polymers,
PProDOT and PEDOT, to obtain a copolymer with the high
solubility and colorless oxidized state of PProDOT and the low
onset of oxidation, high electrochemical activity over a broad
voltage range, and vibrant blue neutral state color of PEDOT. It
has been previously demonstrated in the literature that EDOT
readily undergoes direct (hetero)arylation polymerization
(DHAP) as either the dihydrogen or dihalide species, allowing
for us to avoid the use of more toxic cross-coupling
polymerization methodologies such as the tin reagents
employed in Stille couplings.24,25
2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Additional synthetic procedures, characterization, materials, and
instrumentation details can be found in the Supporting Information.
2.1. Materials. PProDOT was prepared via an oxidative polymer-
ization following a published procedure (Mn: 12.4 kDa; Mw/Mn:
1.8).26 The series of ProDOTx−EDOTy (PxEy) copolymers, shown in
Scheme 1, were synthesized by DHAP (Scheme 2 and Figure S1).
Each of the copolymers was designed to achieve a solubility exceeding
30 mg/mL to be suitable for a wide range of coating methods yielding
ﬁlms with varied thicknesses. To achieve this solubility, PE and PE2
were functionalized with 2-hexyldecyloxy (HD) side chains, whereas
shorter 2-ethylhexyloxy (EH) side chains were suﬃcient for the other
copolymers. P2E (Mn: 14.5 kDa; Mw/Mn: 2.0) and P2E2 (Mn: 14.1
kDa; Mw/Mn: 4.5) were synthesized via previously reported method-
ologies.27,28 PE (Mn: 43.8 kDa; Mw/Mn: 1.4) and PE2 (Mn: 56 kDa;
Mw/Mn: 1.8) were also polymerized using direct arylation polymer-
ization and are described in detail in the Supporting Information.
2.2. Film Preparation. In this study, the copolymers and
PProDOT were spray coated onto ITO/glass (25 × 75 × 0.7 mm3,
sheet resistance: 8−12 ohm/sq, Delta Technologies) using a simple
hand-held airbrush (Iwata-Eclipse HP-BC, 15 psi) from 5 mg/mL
polymer−chloroform solutions (BDH, 99.8%) to an optical density of
1.4−1.6. ITO-coated glass slides were cleaned with toluene, acetone,
and isopropanol and used as the working electrode for the
spectroelectrochemical measurements. Propylene carbonate was used
as the electrolyte solvent (PC, Acros Organics, 99.5%) and was
puriﬁed and dried using a solvent puriﬁcation system from Vacuum
Atmospheres. Tetrabutylammonium hexaﬂuorophosphate (TBAPF6,
Alfa Aesar, 98%) was used as the supporting electrolyte for the
electropolymerization of EDOT as well as the electrochemical and
spectroelectrochemical measurements. TBAPF6 was puriﬁed by
recrystallized from hot ethanol. Glassy carbon button electrodes
(0.07 cm2) were used for the cyclic voltammetry and diﬀerential pulse
voltammetry measurements. For the electrochemical measurements
the polymers were drop cast on the glassy carbon electrodes with a
ﬁxed volume of 3 μL from a 2 mg/mL solution. PEDOT was
potentiostatically polymerized on ITO and glassy carbon at 1.0 V for
30 s in a solution containing 50 mM EDOT dissolved in 0.5 M
TBAPF6-PC.
2.3. Film Characterization. Electrochemical measurements were
performed in a three-electrode cell with a Pt ﬂag as the counter
electrode, a Ag/Ag+ (10 mM AgNO3 in 0.5 M TBAPF6−ACN, E1/2 for
ferrocene: 68 mV) as the reference electrode, and a polymer-coated
glassy carbon button electrode as the working electrode. The voltage
and current were controlled and monitored with an EG&G PAR 273A
potentiostat/galvanostatic under CorrWare control. All ﬁlms were
characterized via cyclic voltammetry between −0.8 and 0.8 V at 50
mV/s for 25 cycles; the onset of oxidation was determined by
diﬀerential pulse voltammetry. The in situ spectroelectrochemical
measurements were carried out using the same potentiostat/
galvanostatic in combination with Varian Cary 5000 UV−vis−NIR
spectrophotometer. The switching speeds were determined by square-
wave potential absorptiometry (chronoabsorptiometry). Change in
absorption was monitored at λmax for the given polymer switched
between two potentials (−1.0 to 1.0 V in the case of PE and PE2). All
colorimetric values were quantiﬁed by converting the absorbance
spectra to CIELAB L*a*b* color coordinates where the L* represents
the white−black balance, a* the green−red balance, and b* the blue−
yellow balance of a given color. Photography was performed using a
Nikon D90 SLR camera with a Nikon 18-105 mm VR lens. The
photographs are presented without any manipulation apart from
cropping. The degree of color saturation for the diﬀerent polymers was
estimated using eq S1 of the Supporting Information where the color
saturation (Sab) is deﬁned as the ratio of chromatic color (Cab* to the
total color sensation on a scale of 0 to 100 where 100 is the pure
color).
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
From the structures shown in Scheme 1, PE2 has the highest
EDOT content of all the copolymers. However, even with
every third heterocycle in PE2 being an alkoxy-functionalized
ProDOT unit, we found this copolymer to be optically (in the
charge neutral state) and electrochemically essentially identical
to electrochemically polymerized PEDOT as shown in the
transmittance spectra and cyclic voltammograms in Figure 1. In
the charge neutral state (−1.0 V in Figure 1a), both PE2 and
PEDOT exhibit a transmittance minimum at ca. 615 nm, giving
them both a deep blue color. Despite the similarities in the
neutral state color, there is a remarkable diﬀerence in the
oxidized state spectra (+1.0 V in Figure 1a). PE2 has a narrower

and more deﬁned absorbance proﬁle in the visible range with
far less tailing into the near-IR in its oxidized state when
compared to PEDOT. This results in both a more neutral color
and a signiﬁcantly more transmissive oxidized state. A
comparison of the cyclic voltammetry of these two polymers
(Figure 1b) shows a remarkable similarity between them in
both the onset of oxidation and voltage range of electroactivity.
Such low potentials for current onsets demonstrate the highly
electron-rich nature of the soluble copolymer ﬁlm, as desired
for applications where accessing the oxidized and conducting
form of the polymer is important. In addition, both polymers
exhibit high capacitive currents beyond the reversible redox
process over a broad potential range (>1.5 V), which is a
desirable attribute when considering these polymers for charge
storage applications. This broad redox response is not typically
seen in soluble ProDOT-based polymers, as they typically tend
to exhibit both a much higher onset of oxidation and a more
deﬁned, Faradaic redox behavior. Interestingly, even though the
ProDOT moieties with their solubilizing groups (i.e., that are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from unfunctionalized EDOT) make up a
third of the polymer chain, the electrochemical properties and
the color in the charge neutral state bare little resemblance to
the ProDOT homopolymer and many similarities to
unfunctionalized PEDOT.
From these results, we focused on understanding how the
PxEy copolymers diﬀered from the parent PProDOT and
PEDOT homopolymers as well as elucidate how changing the
heterocycle ring ratios aﬀected the optical and electrochemical
properties. Surprisingly, the addition of just one EDOT unit for
every three heterocycles drastically altered the band gap and
oxidation onset compared to the homopolymer PProDOT, as
shown in Figure 2. P2E has an optical band gap (Eg,opt) of 1.81
eV, which is signiﬁcantly narrower than the PProDOT
homopolymer with an Eg,opt of 1.97 eV. Similarly, the onset
of oxidation is lowered by 0.43 V when exchanging every third
ProDOT unit for an EDOT. Increasing the amount of EDOT
further from 33% to 50% and ﬁnally to 67% results in a
progressive decrease in both the band gap (Figure 2a) and the
onset of oxidation (Figure 2b), albeit at a more gradual rate.
PE2, with an EDOT content of 67%, has an Eg,opt that is 0.26 eV
smaller than PProDOT but only 0.05 eV larger than
electrochemically polymerized PEDOT. Compared to PPro-
DOT, the oxidation potential is almost 0.8 V lower for PE2.
The lower oxidation potential and narrower Eg,opt is the result
of reduced steric interactions between adjacent rings as the
amount of solubilizing groups decrease, which leads to a
planarization of the polymer backbone.28
As demonstrated in Figure 3a, adding just one EDOT unit to
the ProDOT system (P2E) not only lowers the onset of
oxidation but also results in a signiﬁcant, almost 5-fold, increase
in the current density compared to the ProDOT homopolymer.
The high current density is also maintained for the other
EDOT containing copolymers. Another interesting observation
is found when comparing PE and P2E2; even if the overall
EDOT content in one repeat unit is the same (50%), the
incorporation of a biEDOT unit results in a signiﬁcant, almost
0.3 V decrease in the onset of oxidation. This is likely due to
the planar, electron-rich nature of the biEDOT unit, which, in

comparison to a single EDOT unit, is able to more eﬃciently
stabilize the positive charge carriers formed during oxidation.
The narrowing of the Eg,opt and a red-shift of the λmax (Figure
S2) that is observed as the EDOT content is increased translate
into a color change that progresses from the distinct purple−
magenta color of alkoxy-functionalized PProDOT to the
vibrant deep blue color of PEDOT. To accurately quantify
and compare the colors, the absorbance spectra were converted
to CIELAB L*a*b* coordinates. The a*b* representation in
Figure 3b allows us to quantify both the hue and saturation of
the color where a* represents the red−green balance and b*
the yellow−blue balance of a given color. Further, the L*
coordinate represents the white−black balance (i.e., the
lightness or darkness). All the copolymers fall in the +a* and
−b* (red−magenta−purple−blue) quadrant of the color space,
as shown in Figure 3b and Figure S3. The red-shift observed in
the λmax translates into the color of the polymer becoming more
blue as indicated by the high negative b* and the progressive
lowering of the a* (red) component with increasing EDOT
content and increased chain relaxation. The color coordinates
for all the copolymers are summarized in Table 1. From the
L*a*b* values we can determine the degree of color saturation
(see eq S1 in Supporting Information), which deﬁnes the ratio
of chromatic color to the total color sensation on a scale of 0−
100, where 0 is gray and 100 a pure color.29 All the soluble
copolymers, as well as PProDOT, exhibit a color saturation
between 86 and 91 (see Table 1); these values represent
exceptional degrees of color saturation and color purity for a
material. As seen graphically in Figure 3b and Figure S3 and
numerically in Table 1, the color coordinates of the charge
neutral states of PE2 and PEDOT are very similar. The
diﬀerence in color can be quantitatively compared using eq 1 to
calculate the color diﬀerence (ΔE*ab).29−31 As shown in Table
1, the value of ΔEab* for PE2 and PEDOT is 2.2 in the colored
state. A ΔEab* lower than 2.3 means that two colors (in this case
of PE2 and PEDOT) are indistinguishable to a standard
observer.29,30,32

In addition to a high color saturation and vibrancy, the
copolymers all switch to a highly transmissive and color neutral

and in the color tracks in Figure 3b. In comparison to PEDOT,
all copolymers are more color neutral in their oxidized states as
indicated by the lower a*b* values and the higher L*.33,34 The
slightly negative a*b* values recorded for the oxidized states
are due to tailing of charge carrier bands into the visible as will
be discussed in more detail below.
As shown in Table 2 and demonstrated for PE2 in Figure 3c,
all the copolymers exhibit high electrochromic contrasts (Δ%T,
deﬁned as the change in transmittance between the neutral and
oxidized states measured at λmax) exceeding 70% with switching
times on the order of 0.5−1 s (the chronoabsorptiometry data
for PE and PE2 are shown in Figure S4 and in ref 28 for P2E
and P2E2). Even though comparable electrochromic contrasts
could not be obtained here for PEDOT using our electrolyte
system and polymerization method, a contrast of 71 Δ%T at
635 nm has been reported for electrochemically deposited
PEDOT by Bendikov and co-workers using highly optimized
ﬁlm thicknesses and polymerization conditions.12 The main
diﬀerence in the electrochromic switching performance of this
family of copolymers we observed was that with increasing
EDOT content the potential at which the π−π* absorption
band is completely bleached out decreases following a similar
trend as observed for the Eg,opt, with PE2 essentially reaching its
fully bleached state at just 0.0 V, as shown in the spectra in
Figure 3c. Interestingly, even if little electrochromic change is
observed at higher potentials, PE2 and P2E2 are still able to
maintain a high redox current up to potentials exceeding 1 V vs
Ag/Ag+.
A more careful comparison of the spectroelectrochemistry of
PE2 and PEDOT (Figures 3c and 3d) shows that the
absorption spectra are nearly identical in the charge neutral
states including the same vibronic features, and this accounts
for the similarity in the color of the two polymers as discussed
above. The noticeable diﬀerence in the electrochromic contrast
and in the chromaticity of the oxidized states (with a ΔEab* of
6.2 for PE2 vs PEDOT in their oxidized states) is due to the
charge carrier bands in PEDOT tailing into the visible, leaving
more residual color and reducing contrast. In PE2, the higher
energy charge carrier band originating from polaronic charge
carriers is red-shifted by 100 nm from 923 nm to approximately
1038 nm. Also, the bipolaron absorption (λmax outside the
recorded wavelength range) is shifted to a lower energy in PE2,
which signiﬁcantly reduces the tailing into the visible and
accounts for a more color neutral oxidized state. The positions
of the charge carrier bands in PE2 are more similar to those
found in alkoxy-functionalized PProDOT than those in
PEDOT. This red-shift of charge carrier bands is an interesting
observation as it diﬀers from the trends observed for the Eg,opt,
the color, and the oxidation potential where the copolymers
exhibit properties more closely resembling those of PEDOT
than those of PProDOT.
4. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
In summary, we have developed a highly soluble dioxythio-
phene-based polymer using direct arylation copolymerization
that mimics the electrochemical and optical properties of
PEDOT, and we have been able to accomplish this without
additional surfactants or dispersants. Using this copolymeriza-
tion method, we have prepared a family of polymers that
combines the attractive properties of PEDOT (low oxidation
potential, broad electrochemical window) with those of alkoxy-
functionalized PProDOTs (high solubility and exceptional
electrochromic contrast) with a range of accessible colors. The
polymer with the highest EDOT content (PE2) possesses a
neutral state color that is optically indistinguishable from
electrochemically prepared PEDOT while achieving a higher
contrast and a more color neutral oxidized state. This polymer
also possesses the lowest oxidation potential we have observed
for a soluble thiophene-based polymer and a stable electro-
chemical window of over 2 V. Having these polymers in hand
provides numerous possibilities in various applications
presently being investigated in our laboratory that extend
beyond electrochromism, including highly electrically conduct-
ing (>100 S/cm), hole-transporting and charge dissipating
ﬁlms, along with charge storing supercapacitors, and active
bioelectronic circuit elements.
