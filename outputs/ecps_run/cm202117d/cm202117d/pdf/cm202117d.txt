ABSTRACT: The continuing search for relevant structure−property
relationships in the area of organic electronics is expected to impact
both intrinsic material performance capability and the viability of their
implementation in a broad range of device applications. Cathodically
coloring π-conjugated polymer electrochromes represent a class of
materials potentially attractive for low-cost and nonemissive flexible
display devices including e-paper. Nonetheless, both the synthetic
access to a full range of visible colors and the ability to produce
solution-processable systems that switch rapidly and durably from a
colored neutral state to a highly transmissive doped state upon electro-
chemical oxidation require that material structure−property relation-
ships be carefully examined. In this report, we correlate molecular
structure effects, redox properties, and electrochromic performance for
a series of rationally designed neutral-state green polymers composed of electron-rich 3,4-dioxythiophene (DOT) units and the
electron-deficient core 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD). While homopolymers synthesized from 3,4-alkylenedioxy-bridged mono-
mers including 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and 3,4-propylenedioxythiophenes (ProDOT) have shown particularly
desirable redox-switching properties in the early years of electrochromic polymer development, their “unbridged”
dialkoxythiophene counterparts (DalkOTs) have not raised the same initial interest. Herein, it is shown that low band gap
systems relying on DalkOT units and electron-deficient BTD cores could represent viable alternatives to their ProDOT-based
counterparts in electrochemical devices involving green-to-transmissive switching electrochromes. Interestingly, provided the set
of materials examined in this study, the long-term switching stability of the ProDOT-co-BTD system remains superior to that of its
polymeric analog relying on DalkOTs −exhibiting less than 15% loss of contrast over 20,000 switching cycles (atmospheric
conditions). Long-term cycle life is further demonstrated in a window-type device integrating the ProDOT-co-BTD system. DFT
calculations performed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level suggest subtle variations in the energy-band structure of the polymer repeat-
units and predict the existence of the dual band of optical absorption exhibited by the low-band gap polymers.

■INTRODUCTION
In the area of organic electronics, the identification of relevant
structure−property relationships has become a cornerstone of
material design, accounting for continuous device performance
improvements. This is especially true in the field of organic
photovoltaics where the ability to produce semiconducting
polymers exhibiting tailored molecular structures, along with
excellent charge transport and light-harvesting properties, is
now yielding device power conversion efficiencies approaching
that of a-silicon.1 Likewise, recent work shows that specific
synthetic principles govern the performance of polymeric
semiconductors affording state-of-the-art field-effect mobilities
in thin-film transistors, such as molecular weight and nature of
the solubilizing side-chains.2 In parallel, solution-processable
cathodically coloring electrochromic polymers (ECPs), switch-
ing from a colored neutral state to a highly transmissive doped
state upon electrochemical oxidation, could be rapidly implemented
into display devices by developing synthetic ways to access
a broad palette of neutral state colors, while maintaining fast
and stable switching properties.3 In this area, the ability to
produce colored-to-transmissive switching systems exhibiting
yellow, orange, and red neutral states has been hindered by

the requirement for a highly transmissive doped state,3a,d,4 as
the neutral state optical absorption must be fully transferred
into the near-IR. Typically, radical-cations (i.e., polarons) and
dications (i.e., bipolarons) possessing longer-wavelength
absorption bands than those of the neutral polymer electro-
chrome will form upon electrochemical doping. Ideally, this
phenomenon is accompanied by the bleaching of the π−π*
transition of the polymer in the visible, without residual
absorption detectable by the human eye when fully doped.
While this has been effectively achieved with purple-, magenta-,
and blue-colored polymer electrochromes, for which the neutral
state optical transition approaches the near-IR region of the
spectrum,3a,5 highly transmissive states become substantially
more challenging to access with neutral state absorption spectra
shifted toward shorter wavelengths.
Green is another color state which has been historically
difficult to achieve with π-conjugated polymers, and continuous
research effort has been invested over the past few years to
identify the molecular design principles affording green-to-
transmissive switching electrochromes.3a,b Early developments
by Wudl et al. have shown that green polymer electrochromes
can be achieved following synthetic principles relying on the
incorporation of two distinct chromophores inducing a dual
band of optical absorption in the visible spectrum.6 In this case,
the concomitant presence of short- and long-wavelength optical
transitions centered around the 500−550 nm region fulfills
coverage of both the blue and the red regions of the spectrum,
respectively, and affords the desired color. Nevertheless, it is
only recently that the substantial lack of transmissivity in
the doped state of the polymers originally introduced was
overcome.7 In particular, it was found that polymer repeat unit
structures alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient
substituents, hence following donor−acceptor principles,8 are
prone to induce a dual band of absorption in the visible region
of the spectrum, in absence of a second chromophore in-
corporated along the polymer backbone.7a While the
fundamentals behind this empirical finding remain a matter
of discussion,3b this design principle has produced dual bands
of absorption capable of bleaching extensively upon doping,
whereas secondary chromophores with short-wavelength
absorptions hinder this mechanism.6 Nevertheless, at this
stage of electrochromic polymer development, little is known
about the factors influencing redox switching, and the
structure−property relationships impacting the electrochromic
performance of polymeric systems relying on the donor−
acceptor approach remain to be identified.
In this contribution, we report on molecular structure effects
and electrochromic performance correlations for a series of
rationally designed neutral-state green polymers composed
of electron-rich 3,4-dioxythiophene (DOT) units and the
electron-deficient core 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTD). While
the outstanding redox-cycling and color-switching capabilities
of homopolymers of DOTs, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxthio-
phene) (PEDOT), were established early on in the develop-
ment of π-conjugated polymers for electrochromic applica-
tions,9 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene (ProDOT) building units
yield polymer electrochromes with superior color-contrasts and
long-term redox cyclability, in agreement with their deeper
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).3a In comparison,
their “unbridged” dialkoxythiophene analogs (DalkOTs) have
received limited attention, and, as recently demonstrated, their
corresponding homopolymers have met with limited electro-
chromic performance so far.4a
Nevertheless, both ProDOT and DalkOT units have recently
been successfully incorporated in donor−acceptor backbones
with BTD to achieve stable colored-to-transmissive switching
electrochromes with neutral color states commonly difficult to
achieve, such as cyan blue, blue-green, and varying ranges of
green.7,10 The ability to produce ECPs that rely on DalkOT
electron-rich building units and are stable to electrochemical
processes would substantially simplify the synthetic access to
blue and green solution-processable systems, thus impacting
the commercial viability of polymers for electrochromic device
applications. In this study, a set of solution-processable green
polymer electrochromes with repeat units exhibiting distinct
DOT sequences are introduced with the goal of providing

further insight into the influence of molecular structure −such
as the nature of the DOT units and the extent of aliphatic
substituents imparting solubilizing power −on redox properties
and long-term switching stability. In particular, electrochromic
performance, including long-term stability, is shown to depend
on a subtle combination of these two structural parameters.
■RESULTS
Synthetic Approach and Polymer Characterization. The
repeat unit structures of the polymers examined in this
contribution are shown in Chart 1. Following synthetic
principles recently introduced by our group for the synthesis
of spray-processable green-to-transmissive switching polymer
electrochromes,7a these repeat units were constructed by
flanking two electron-rich moieties −DalkOT or ProDOT −
to the electron-deficient core BTD, yielding symmetrical
macromonomers that could be subsequently polymerized
using the oxidizing agent FeCl3 (see Figure S1). In addition,
the solution-processability of the polymers was probed and
tuned by incorporating DalkOT units possessing simple
methoxy substituents, as in P2 and P3, as opposed to the
branched 2-ethylhexyl substituents systematically appended to
ProDOT, as in P6. While P1, P2, and P3 were intentionally
designed to be exclusively composed of DalkOT units with the
goal to establish direct comparisons with P6, itself exclusively
composed of ProDOT units, mixed ProDOT and DalkOT
units were used to produce P5 and P4 and to look for
intermediate properties. The search for alternate neutral state
green hues has motivated the incorporation of single ring
thiophene units, as in P7a, P7b, and P8, intrinsically less
electron-rich than their DOT counterparts. General procedures
for the synthesis of the macromonomers and polymers
considered in this study are described in the Supporting
Information (SI). As can be seen in the MALDI mass spectrum
of P6 in Figure 1, there is a series of peaks that correspond to
an oligomer series. The separation of these peaks is 1990 amu,

which matches the calculated value of the repeat unit structure of
P6. Inspection of the region of the dimer peak reveals a dimer
with two chlorine end groups, as well as a cluster of dimers at
higher mass with a variety of other end groups. A number of other
representative polymer repeat unit structures were confirmed by
MALDI-MS, which data are shown in the SI (Figure S2).
As shown in Table 1, polymers with number average
molecular weight (Mn) on the order of 10 kDa and above were
achieved, thus reaching a π-conjugated sequence commonly
accepted to impart saturated optical absorption spectra. In
general, the molecular weights attained for the polymers were
such that further increases would yield substantial fractions of
insoluble material to be separated at the purification stage.
Therefore, the lowest molecular weights obtained are some-
times indicative of solubility limitations, as is the case with P4,
P5, and P7b. In contrast, some repeat unit structures −that of
P1 and P3 in particular −afforded molecular weights in excess
of 20 kDa that retained excellent solution-processability
properties. Interestingly, swapping the DOT units, as in P2
and P3, was found to impact polymer processability and
achievable molecular weight. In general, polymer processability
increased when the DOT units bearing branched solubilizing
side-chains were directly flanked to the electron-deficient core
BTD, as in P3, while a sequence of three “unsubstituted”
heterocycles, as in P2, limited the molecular weight attainable
following the oxidative polymerization strategy used in this
study. In addition, the incorporation of branched 2-ethylhexyl
DalkOT units along the backbone was found to impart substan-
tially higher polymer solubility than when branched 2-ethylhexyl
ProDOT units were used. Thus, P1 dissolved readily in common
organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene,
while the dissolution of P6 necessitated warming up the
polymer in solution. Similarly, the solubility of P3 was found to
be superior to that of P8, in spite of the higher molecular
weight attained in the case of P3 (ca. 43 kDa vs 11 kDa).
As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2, all the polymers described
in this study possess a dual band of absorption with trans-
mission windows centered around the 450−500 nm region in
solution and around the 500−550 nm region as thin films, thus
reflecting/transmitting various tones of green. The hue of green
observed depended largely on the nature of the DOT units
incorporated along the polymer backbone, with ProDOT units
inducing the most significant red-shifts to the spectra. As
illustrated in Figure 2a, the insertion of methoxy-substituted
DalkOT units also induced subtle red-shifts in optical absorption,
thus suggesting a diminution of the sterics that govern torsion
angles along the backbone. Thus, the two local maxima of absorp-
tion of P3 were more red-shifted than those of P1. In addition,
swapping the DOT units so as to create a sequence of three
“unsubstituted” heterocycles, as in P2, further red-shifted both the
onset of absorption and the longer-wavelength local absorption
maximum. Figure 2b emphasizes that distinct combinations and
sequences of DOT heterocycles can lead to near-identical optical
patterns, albeit with subtle variations in absorption onset
suggesting slight differences in energy band structure.

ground state geometry (Figure 3) and electronic structure
(Figure 4) of the repeat units anticipated to achieve two-band

counterpart,11 no symmetry restrictions were imposed on the
propylenedioxy bridge of ProDOT. The vertical energy transition
data and oscillator strengths were produced by time-dependent
density functional theory (TD-DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level.
As illustrated in Figure 3, and confirmed by the near-identical
torsion angles (sulfur to sulfur) reported in Table 2, the
optimized ground state geometries obtained with repeat units
consisting of four DalkOTs or ProDOTs symmetrically
substituted around a BTD electron-deficient core are not
significantly different. In particular, Figure 3b confirms that the
presence of the noncoplanar 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene bridge
in ProDOT does not significantly impact backbone planarity and
conjugation. Therefore, the subtle differences seen in the solu-
tion optical spectra of P3 and P6 (Figure 2), onset of absorption
in particular, could be the result of (i) intrinsic differences in the
energetics of the repeat units (itself related to the degree of
orbital overlap between alkoxy substituents and aromatic ring)
and (ii) the difference in substitution patterns of solubilizing side
groups. In fact, the differences seen in the solution optical spectra
of P1, P3, and P2 (Figure 2), which are exclusively composed of
DalkOT building units, suggest that the nature of the
substitution pattern along the conjugated backbone does play a
role, yielding subtle shifts of both short- and long-wavelength
optical transitions. Nevertheless, in comparing P3 and P6, it is
worth noting that the DalkOT units bearing the solubilizing
groups in P3 are effectively spaced by simple 3,4-dimethoxy-
substituted DOT units, thus clearly minimizing the possible
side-chain interactions along the polymer backbones. In
parallel, as shown in Figure S3 and further supported by the
dihedral angle values reported in Table 2, the insertion of un-
substituted thiophene substituents, as in the repeat units of
P7a and P7b, can significantly planarize the backbone. As shown
in Table 1, this in turn impacts polymer optical absorption by
red-shifting both short- and long-wavelength optical transitions.
Figure 4 highlights the differences in molecular orbital energy
levels for the same repeat units (BTD-DalkOT4 and BTD-
ProDOT4). In spite of the near-identical pattern of electronic
delocalization, significant energetic differences exist between
highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied frontier orbital
energies (on the order of 0.1 eV) and between their peripheral
energy levels (HOMO-1 and LUMO+1 are represented here).
It is therefore expected that the polymer energy-band structures
differ to some extent. While the presence of the 3,4-propyl-
enedioxy bridge in ProDOT may not significantly impact back-
bone planarity, these results further reinforce the argument that
intrinsic differences in the energetics of the repeat units −most
likely connected to the varying degree of orbital overlap between
the oxygen lone-pairs of the alkoxy substituents and the π-electron
system of the thiophene ring −can exist. Along these lines, and as
illustrated by the slight differences in predicted HOMOs
emphasized in Figure 4, ProDOT units appear somewhat more
electron-rich than their DalkOT unit counterparts.
Overall, the DFT-predicted energy gaps for the polymer
repeat units fall in the range 2.15−2.25 eV as shown in Table 2,
while the same energy gaps fall in the range 1.85−1.95 eV by
TD-DFT as shown in Table 3. These results are relatively close

in value to the empirical optically estimated gaps (EgOPT) found
in the range 1.5−1.6 eV for the polymers (see Table 1, P2-P8),
albeit not identical as expected considering (i) the finite size of
the representative fragments used for the calculations and (ii)
the approximations inherent to the level of theory employed in
this study (e.g., solid state packing effects brought in on film
formation). In all cases, a narrow window of ca. 0.1 eV defines
the range estimated for the energy gaps, which supports the
minimal optical changes undergone upon varying the DOT
substituents incorporated along the polymer backbones. It is
likely that the solubilizing substituents present on every
adjacent DalkOT unit along the backbone of P1 impart
this polymer its wider band gap by introducing steric
hindrances difficult to account for by DFT. In addition, the
results presented in Table 3 support the existence of two
main optical transitions for the polymers: a high-energy
transition with mixed valence and charge-transfer excitation
characteristics and involving HOMO and LUMO+1 and a
low-energy transition mostly HOMO→LUMO in character
and with substantial charge-transfer characteristics as illus-
trated for the BTD-DalkOT4 and BTD-ProDOT4 fragments
in Figure 4.
Polymer Electrochemistry. The redox properties of P1-
P8 were investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in order to correlate
polymer redox potentials, electrochemically derived HOMO
and LUMO energy levels, and corresponding electrochemical
bandgaps, with the successive structural modifications induced
in the repeat unit and the theoretical trends predicted at the
DFT level (vide supra). It is worth noting that, while CV
measurements still represent the most commonly reported
values throughout the π-conjugated polymer literature, DPV is
now more clearly established to account for a higher sensitivity,
hence yielding sharper redox onsets along the electrochemical
process as a result of a reduction of the charging background
currents.10b,12 This, in turn, increases the accuracy of the energy
gaps estimated electrochemically and explains why DPV values
will be the primary values referred to throughout this
manuscript over CV values which are only reported as a
comparison tool. Thin films of the polymers were drop-cast
onto platinum disk electrodes from toluene solutions (1−2 mg
mL−1) for characterization in an argon-filled drybox. A
platinum flag was used as the counter electrode in combination
with a Ag/Ag+ reference electrode, and all results were sub-
sequently calibrated to Fc/Fc+ (for consistency with the rest of
this manuscript). The estimated polymer energy levels
(HOMO and LUMO) are presented in Table 4 and provided
relative to the vacuum level, considering that the SCE is 4.7 eV
vs vacuum13 and Fc/Fc+ is 0.38 eV vs SCE,14 i.e. ∼5.1 eV
relative to vacuum. (Note: a number of inconsistencies in the
use of i) the Fc/Fc+ redox couple and ii) the values used for the
absolute potentials of standard electrodes have recently been
highlighted15).
Prior to characterization, the polymer films were cycled at a
scan rate of 50 mV s−1 between −0.35 and 0.65 V until they
reached a stable and reproducible electrochemical response.
The polymer films were found to be stable to p-type doping
within this potential range in 0.1 M TBAP/propylene carbonate
(PC) electrolyte solutions, retaining 85−98% (depending on
the polymer structure) of their peak current after 100 switches.
Upon careful examination of the data presented in Table 4,
Figure 5, and Figure S4 a number of observations can be made

P3, and P2 presented in Figure 5, markedly different oxidation
potentials can be measured as a function of the extent of
aliphatic solubilizing side-chain material appended along the
backbone, while the π-conjugated main-chain remains the same.
Here, P1 which has the largest extent of aliphatic substituents
shows an onset of oxidation at 0.32 V, whereas P3 and P2
exhibit substantially lower oxidation potentials of −0.1 V and
−0.17 V, respectively. In attempting to rationalize this apparent
interdependence between electrochemically estimated oxida-
tion and aliphatic substitution pattern, a number of con-
tributing factors can be referred to such as (i) the variable
insulating character of the side-chain material affecting applied
potential, (ii) the variations of backbone planarity and extended
conjugation with the length and bulkiness of the side groups,
and (iii) ion transport limitations introduced by the low
dielectric aliphatic media. At the same time, it is worth noting
that the reduction potentials (onsets in the range 1.45−1.55 V
for the first reduction) are not affected as critically by the
substitution pattern, which could be attributed to an effect of
“pinning” of the anions created along the backbones.
Interestingly, two reductions were directly observable, with
the first one attributed to the formation of anion radicals
localized on the electron-accepting BTD units, and the second
one attributed to the formation of dianions.
Similarly, the same empirical observation can be made in
comparing P4, P5, and P6, as emphasized in Figure S4a. In this
case, the polymer analog possessing the largest extent of
solubilizing side-chains is P6, which also possesses the highest
oxidation potential across this series. In addition, it is
interesting to note that the positioning of the donor units
relative to the acceptor BTD also impacts the polymer
oxidation potential. In this case, keeping the most electron-
rich moieties (ProDOTs) away from the electron-deficient
core, as in P4, allows for the lowest oxidation potential to be
attained (−0.3 V). Here again, two reductions can be observed
with comparable onsets across the polymer series (in the range
1.5−1.65 V for the first reduction). While low band gap
polymer reductions are expected to be governed by the
accepting core, it is plausible that the electron-deficient
character of BTD undergoes minor variations as a function of
the energetics of the electron-donating units directly appended
to it. This could explain the minor fluctuations observed on
going from one system to another.
In comparing the DPVs of P7a and P7b presented in
Figure S4b, neither the oxidation potentials (ca. −0.2 V) nor
the reduction potentials (ca. −1.5 V) are significantly affected
by the structure of the solubilizing side-chains appended to the
backbone (i.e., linear vs branched) in this configuration for
which the same number of aliphatic carbons are involved.
However, the higher oxidation potential measured for P8 (ca.
0 V vs Fc/Fc+) supports the idea that the positioning of the
donor units relative to the acceptor core impacts the polymer
oxidation potential. Keeping the most electron-rich moieties
(ProDOTs) away from the electron-deficient core, as in P7a
and P7b, yields the lowest oxidation potentials.
The lower oxidation potential of P4 (−0.3 V) vs that of P7b
(−0.21 V), and of P5 (−0.175 V) vs that of P8 (ca. 0 V),
suggests a confirmation that the electron-rich character of the
3,4-dimethoxy-substituted DOT units incorporated along P4
and P5 prevails in the control of the oxidation of the resulting
polymer over the effect of extended backbone planarity and
conjugation (as expected with P7b and P8 by DFT, see Table 2).
Furthermore, the lower oxidation potential of P4 (−0.3 V) vs
that of P2 (−0.17 V), and of P5 (−0.175 V) vs that of P3
(−0.1 V), indicates that the polymer HOMO can be more
effectively raised by incorporating ProDOT units bearing the
solubilizing substituents. It is essential to note that this
conclusion alone cannot imply that ProDOT is intrinsically
more electron-rich than a DalkOT since a number of critical
parameters are to be taken into consideration such as (i) back-
bone planarity and conjugation and (ii) the number of aliphatic
carbons appended to the DOT units and accounting for the
solubility (vide supra). As empirically shown when comparing
P1 and P3/P2 in this same section, these parameters impact
the polymer oxidation and cannot reasonably be factored out.
Importantly, DFT calculations may not account for these
variations. These experimental results are in good agreement
with results obtained earlier by examining DalkOT- and
ProDOT-based polymer electrochromes yielding cyan-blue
and blue-green neutral states, respectively.10b In the latter
case, lower onsets of oxidation and, in turn, higher electro-
chemically estimated HOMO levels had been identified.
Many of these low band gap polymers exhibit oxidation
potentials that are significantly lower than that of the control
homopolymer of ProDOT, namely PC (−0.1 V), such as P2,
P4, P5, and P7b, which strongly reinforces the argument that
the electron-rich character of the donor units involved is
certainly not the only parameter influencing polymer oxidation.
Overall, this direct comparative study highlights a number
of structural parameters that largely influence the oxidation
potential of low band gap polymers and raises a number of
fundamental questions concerning the determination of polymer
energy band edges. In particular, it will be of interest to correlate
these electrochemically estimated results with values collected by
spectroscopic methods which may not necessarily reflect this
strong dependence on backbone substitution pattern.
Polymer Spectroelectrochemical Analysis. The results
of the spectroelectrochemical analyses carried out with P3, P6,
P2, P5, P7a, and P8 are presented in Figure 6. These results
illustrate the propensity of each low band gap polymer to pro-
duce positively charged carriers upon electrochemical oxidation
and provide initial insight into polymer electrochromicity.
Typically, radical-cations (polarons) and dications (bipolar-
ons) possessing longer-wavelength optical absorption bands
than those of the neutral polymer will form upon doping. At
the same time, the extent of depletion of the neutral state
interband transition(s) depends on the degree of stability
attained by the charge carriers and on the ability of the
polymeric backbone to achieve an extended quinoidal geometry
(configuration arising from the formation of the bipolaronic
states). As a result, it is expected that even minimal structural
changes along the polymer backbone can induce substantial
variations in electrochromic performance, including neutral
state color and switching ability. In the specific case where the
neutral state visible absorption of the polymer is fully
transferred into the near-infrared (near-IR) upon doping, the
material is said to be “cathodically-coloring” and can yield a
highly transmissive doped state.
The polymers were spray-cast from toluene or dichloro-
methane (ca. 2 mg mL−1) onto indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated
glass slides at room temperature. Electrochemical redox switching
of the films was carried out in 0.1 M TBAP/PC supporting
electrolyte using Ag/Ag+ as a quasi-reference electrode and a
platinum wire as the counter electrode. Note that all results were
subsequently calibrated to Fc/Fc+ for consistency throughout the
manuscript.

The first striking result is observed in comparing P3 and P5.
The two polymer analogs differ by the nature of the DOT units
bearing the solubilizing groups and allowing spray-process-
ability. While the use of ProDOT to achieve electrochromic
polymers exhibiting high-contrasts, fast and particularly stable
switches, has been clearly established in recent years,3a it is

oxidation of the films was carried out in 0.1 M TBAP/PC supporting electrolyte using Ag/Ag+ as a quasi-reference electrode (all results were

interesting to note that DalkOTs have not attracted the same
level of attention. In fact, homopolymers of DalkOTs have last
been reported to possess only moderate electrochromic
performance, including modest contrast ratios at high switching
rates and limited long-term stability on repeated electro-
chemical switching.4a Figure 6a and b shows the normalized
spectral changes occurring in the 300−1600 nm range upon
electrochemical oxidation of these two polymers which both
exhibit a two-band absorption in the visible spectrum with a
major contribution from the lower energy transition. With an
open gap in light absorption centered in the range 500−520 nm,
a substantial absorption between 350 and 450 nm, and a broad
coverage of the red portion of the visible, these polymers
exhibit hues of green. The low energy transition of P5 being
significantly shifted toward longer wavelengths in comparison
to that of P3 (λabs2 = 663 nm vs 635 nm), the resulting hues
differ by a subtle yellow hue detectable by the human eye in the
case of P5. Noticeably, the two polymers show near-identical
bleaching propensities upon electrochemical doping, reaching a
state of low residual visible absorption. Taking the two local
absorption maxima as references, P3 shows a transmittance
change (Δ%T) of 44.0% (λabs1) and 30.8% (λabs2), comparable
to 47.4% (λabs1) and 38.9% (λabs2) for P5, and suggesting that
excellent contrast ratios could be attained upon electrochemical
switching. When fully oxidized, bipolaronic states peaking
beyond 1600 nm in the infrared with almost no visible
absorption govern their optical spectra, and, as a result, both
polymers show a remarkably high level of transparency to the
human eye. This initial result with P3 suggests that low band
gap systems relying on DalkOT units could represent viable
alternatives to their ProDOT-based counterparts.
In comparison with P3, the spectroelectrochemical footprint
of P2 shown as Figure 6c supports the idea that swapping
DOTs along the polymer backbone induces subtle variations in
optical absorption. In particular, it should be noted that the
ability of P2 to switch to a highly transmissive doped state upon
electrochemical oxidation is not equivalent to that of P3. Here,
P2 shows relative transmittance changes of 28.2% (λabs1) and
17.1% (λabs2), that are significantly inferior to those of P3. This
result could suggest that the position of the solubilizing side-
chains along the backbone further impacts the redox switching
of the polymer. In contrast, P6 (Figure 6d) composed of
ProDOT units all appended with solubilizing side-chains
exhibits transmittance changes comparable to those of P3,
and at this stage these two polymers appear relatively
equivalent.
Similarly, as illustrated by P7a and P8 in Figure 6e and f,
swapping the electron-rich heterocycles along the polymer
backbone induces observable variations in optical absorption.
However, in this case, both polymers possess comparable
transmittance changes on the order of 41.0% (λabs1) and 26.0%
(λabs2) for P7a and 38.0% and 26.0% respectively for P8.
Switching Studies. Fresh films of P2 and P6 were spray-
coated onto ITO and their deposition simultaneously
monitored by transmittance measurements at their long
wavelength absorption maximum (λabs2), so as to ensure
equivalent neutral state absorption between films. Of all
polymers, these two systems were chosen to demonstrate the
potential of all-DalkOT-based low band gap polymers for
electrochromic applications, relative to the redox switching
performance of an all-ProDOT-based electrochrome. Here
again, it is worth mentioning that homopolymers of ProDOT
have historically yielded especially high contrast ratios and fast
redox switches,3a whereas homopolymers of DalkOTs have
shown only moderate electrochromic performance, including
limited contrast ratios on rapid EC switching.4a
Considering the optical density as representative of the
thickness of active layer deposited, neutral polymer thin-films of
near-identical consistencies were obtained (%T(λabs2) = 9−
12%), allowing reliable comparison of their electrochromic
performance. Each film was redox-cycled until a stable and
reproducible switch was reached prior to data collection and
comparison.
Figure 7 shows the transmittance change (or EC contrast,
Δ%T) attained as a function of time and at the longer
wavelength absorption maximum of each material, applying
square-wave potential steps in the range 10 to 1.5 s (v). For this
analysis, the lower energy transition was monitored due to its
more intense absorption in the visible region, and it is, in turn,
expected that its contrast ratio and rate of depletion will be
representative of the polymer’s overall EC switching ability. In
general, square-wave potential stepping experiments are
preferred over potential cycling when characterizing the

following: 10 s step for 40 s (2 cycles), 3 s step for 20 s (7 cycles), 2 s
step for 20 s (5 cycles), and 1.5 s step for 20 s (13 cycles).

response time of a thin-film electrochrome as significant optical
change occurs in less than 0.1 s.
As illustrated in Figure 7, P2 and P6 exhibit strikingly
comparable switching patterns with less than 10% of EC
contrast variation as the stepping time is decreased down to 1.5
s in both cases. At this stepping time, EC contrasts of 33.3%
and 36.3% are maintained for P2 and P6, respectively. In
particular, this result strongly supports the use of all-DalkOT-
based low band gap systems as electrochromes for switchable
device applications. Given the difference in oxidation potentials
of ca. 0.3 V between the two polymers, with P2 being easier to
oxidize (vide supra), the near-identical switching performance
of P6 suggests that a particularly favorable and reversible planar
quinoidal geometry is attained upon doping. It is likely that the
‘spiro-like’ centers of ProDOT maintaining the branched
solubilizing side-chains out of the plane of the conjugated
main-chain increase the interchain spacing allowing ions to
penetrate into and out of the film more freely. This would in
turn be expected to enhance the reversible formation of
polarons coupling into stable bipolarons upon doping.
Colorimetric Measurements. Another set of fresh films
of P3, P5, P6, P2, P7a, and P8 were spray-cast at thicknesses
representative of their optimal colorimetric performance onto
ITO-coated glass, and the color changes resulting from the
redox switching of the films were characterized based on the
‘Commission Internationale de l′Eclairage’ 1976 L*a*b* color
standards.17 Each film was redox-cycled prior to data collection,
and the colorimetric measures were taken under constant
illumination of the polymer thin-films. Figure 8 illustrates the
colorimetrically determined relative luminance changes,
estimating the brightness of the transmitted light as a
percentage of the brightness of the light source calibrated to
the sensitivity of the human eye and monitored as a function of
the doping level induced by electrochemical oxidation (the
corresponding absorbance of the films at λabs2 is reported in the
legends). Figure 9 locates neutral and fully doped color states
for each polymer on a two-dimensional a*b* diagram
generated from the plots of relative luminance as a function
of applied potential and film thickness presented in Figure 8. In
Figure 9, photographs of the polymer films provide a visual
insight into how the structural modifications induced along the
polymer backbones influence their neutral and oxidized color
states.
Figure 8a compares films of near-equivalent neutral state
luminance values of polymer P3 and P5, respectively.
Noticeably, while the monochromatic transmittance ratios
calculated from the spectroelectrochemical analysis at the local
absorption maxima of P3 and P5 predicted slightly higher
contrasts in the case of P5, here the colorimetric patterns of the
two polymers relying on the perception of the broad visible
region are nearly equivalent, demonstrating luminance-change
values as high as ca. 38%. Nevertheless, the steeper slope of
the curve of relative luminance vs voltage in the case of P3 is
indicative of a switch taking place in a narrower potential
window. Thus, P3 switches in a potential window of ca. 0.6 V,
whereas P5 completes its full switch in a potential window of
ca. 0.7 V.
In contrast, Figure 8b emphasizes the higher luminance-
change values achievable with P2 (ca. 39%) in comparison with
P6 (ca. 33%). Here, it is worth noting that luminance
measurements are not linear functions of film thickness,
which justifies in this particular case a result that would
otherwise be somewhat surprising in light of the excellent
monochromatic transmittance ratios demonstrated by P6
throughout the spectroelectrochemical experiments. Interest-

of fully neutral and oxidized states are reported for the films.

neutral state, reaches the same level of transmissivity upon
electrochemical doping, with an L* coordinate of 82 (noting
that L* is 100 at the “white point” of color space), while a* and
b* are approaching the white coordinates (0,0).
As anticipated based on the spectroelectrochemical experiments,
and in spite of the structural changes brought to the polymer repeat
unit (i.e., swapping of the electron-rich heterocycles), P7a and P8
are shown in Figure 8c to possess near-identical colorimetric
responses at the film thickness considered for this analysis. In
particular, both polymers demonstrate excellent luminance-change
values on the order of 36% upon electrochemical oxidation.
In Figure 9a, the various neutral state greens obtained upon
changing the structural composition of the electron-rich
sequences along the backbone are related to their a*b*
coordinates. While, the large negative a* account for the deep
green saturation achieved, clear distinctions in hue can be identified
from the positioning of each system on this two-dimensional
diagram; positive b* values indicating a yellow hue, and
negative b* values indicating blue tones in the green color state.
Thus, of all polymers, P8 (b*= −6) possesses the largest extent
of blue component, while P5 (b*= +4) possesses the largest
extent of yellow component in its neutral state. As illustrated in
Figure 9b, highly transmissive doped states are attained upon
electrochemical oxidation. Interestingly, these transmissive states
systematically show residual components of green and blue, as
indicated by the low values of a* and b* coordinates retained by
the films when fully doped. These residual components of green
and blue are easily explained from the spectroelectrochemical
analyses, whereby polaronic and bipolaronic optical transitions of
the fully doped thin-film electrochromes have a tendency to tail
into the red region of the visible (vide supra). Overall, it is worth
noting that these residual color states are hardly perceptible by
the human eye. In particular, these transmissive states are
certainly adequate for application in window devices.
Stability Studies. Considering all the green-to-transmissive
switching polymer electrochromes synthesized in this study
and characterized throughout the previous sections, P2 and
P6 have shown excellent color contrasts, switching times,
and short-term redox reversibility. Importantly, the two poly-
mers possess (i) distinct repeat units involving either DalkOT
(P2) or ProDOT units (P6) as the electron-rich substituents
and (ii) distinct patterns of solubilizing side-chains imparting
adequate solubilizing power to each π-conjugated backbone.
While the switching experiments discussed so far have not
revealed substantial performance differences between P2 and P6,
their individual resistance to long-term electrochemical switching
remains a critical parameter to be examined as these systems are
being considered for commercial display applications.
Long-term redox reversibility was inspected using thin-films
spray-deposited on ITO-coated glass and subjected to square-
wave potential steps of 2 s (a duration adapted to the individual
response-time of the polymers as illustrated in Figure 7). Figure 10
demonstrates the performance of spray-deposited thin-films of
P2 and P6 subjected to 20,000 redox cycles in 0.1 M LiBTI/PC
solution and under atmospheric conditions.
As shown in Figure 10a, the initial transmittance change (Δ%
T, as defined by %T(DS)-%T(NS)) of ca. 37% for P2, as
measured at the longer wavelength absorption maximum
(λabs2= 642 nm), levels off to ca. 30% following an initial
break-in period of several hundreds of cycle. While the initial
Δ%T is in excellent agreement with the value estimated under
short-term redox switching conditions for a film of near-
identical neutral state optical density (see Figure 7b), the long-
term stability analysis reveals that this initial contrast is not
necessarily maintained over multiple switching cycles. The
variation of Δ%T is then more progressive in the range 2,500−
20,000 cycles, slowly decreasing from ca. 30% to ca. 15%. In
spite of the continuous diminution of Δ%T observed in this
range, the respectable Δ%T value of ca. 25% retained at cycle
10,000 −a threshold of commercial viability −is worth noting
and reinforces the relevance of DalkOT building units in the
design of donor−acceptor ECPs with unconventional color
states. Importantly, it should not be excluded that the long-term
switching properties of P2 might improve substantially upon
carefully redefining the pattern of solubilizing substituents
appended along the polymer backbone, so as to optimize
the processability-solubility couple impacting the stability of
the polymer thin-films relative to the electrode material.
In particular, the solubilizing side groups of a solution-processable
ECP should be chosen such that subsequent thin-films be
sufficiently ‘insoluble’ and compact to remain strongly adhered
to the working electrode material while being able to maintain
effective swelling properties and allow rapid diffusion of the
charge balancing counterions throughout the polymeric
network. Alternatively, defunctionalizable side-chains could be
introduced following a strategy demonstrated earlier with
homopolymers of ProDOT.18 Nonetheless, it should be noted

and b) fully oxidized states are reported for the films.

that the extent of polymer delamination or dissolution is generally
reduced in devices employing gel electrolytes in comparison with
that seen in a conventional solution electrochemical cell.
In contrast to the DalkOT-based derivative and as shown in
Figure 10b, the long-term switching profile of the ProDOT-
based derivative P6 does not involve a break-in within the first
few hundred redox cycles. The initial transmittance change
(Δ%T) of 37%, as measured at the longer wavelength absor-
ption maximum (λabs2= 648 nm), is also in excellent agreement
with the value estimated under short-term redox switching
conditions for a film of near-identical neutral state optical
density (see Figure 7a) and remains nearly constant over the
first 5,000 switching cycles. The diminution of Δ%T with redox
switching is then remarkably slow and progressive in the range
5,000−20,000 cycles, varying from ca. 35% to ca. 30%. This
represents less than 15% of electrochromic loss and cor-
responds to one of the best ECP performance to date.3a In
particular, it is worth noting that in spite of the presence of
branched 2-ethylhexyl solubilizing substituents on every DOT
unit, the thin-films of ECP do not delaminate from the electrode
material, which confirms the inherent propensity of ProDOT to
reduce solubility in π-conjugated polymer backbones.
In light of the excellent long-term switching stability of P6 in
conventional three-electrode electrochemical cells, and in order
to demonstrate the potential of this ECP for actual “smart”
windows and display device applications, its switching perform-
ance was investigated in an electrochromic device (ECD) com-
posed of the ECP at the ITO-coated glass working electrode
and a “minimally color-changing polymer” (MCCP), namely N-
alkyl substituted poly(3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole), balancing charges
at the counter-electrode. A highly transparent and conducting
(6.5 mS cm−1) gel electrolyte composed of 7.2% of 1-ethyl-3-
methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide (EMI-BTI,
electrochemical grade >99.5%, Covalent Associates, Inc.), 7.0% of
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Mw = 996,000 g mol−1),
48.1% of propylene carbonate (PC), 37.7% of ethylenecarbonate
(Ec) (wt%), and 5 mg of glass beads (100 μm, BioSpec Products,
Inc.) per 12 mL of solvent was employed for the device fabrica-
tion, which was achieved under ambient atmosphere. Ultrafast
curable epoxy (Hardman, double-bubble red #4001) was used to
seal the device, which was further tested under ambient
atmosphere. As shown in Figure 11a, the relative luminance
changes of the ECD were monitored as a function of the
doping level induced by electrochemical oxidation. The absor-
bance of the counter-electrode material MCCP being only
minimal in the visible, the luminance change value of 34.1%
measured in the device is in excellent agreement with that of
Figure 10. Long-term switching of spray-cast a) P2 (monitored at 642

the individual polymer P6 obtained in the conventional
electrochemical cell (33.1%, Figure 8b). Importantly, with L*
coordinates of 60 in the neutral state, and 83 upon
electrochemical oxidation, this device reaches the same levels
of contrast and transmissivity as those described earlier in
Figure 8b. Similarly, a* (−3) and b* (−7) are approaching the
white coordinates (0,0) in the doped state, with negative values
indicative of light hues of green and blue, respectively. The
window device demonstrated a fast and efficient optical modul-
ation with (i) 31.3% of transmittance contrast, as calculated for
95% of the full charge/discharge cycle and achieved within a
0.38 s switching speed, and (ii) a high coloration efficiency
(CE) of 443 mC cm−2. The long-term switching profile of the
polymer ECD shown in Figure 11b accounts for an initial
transmittance change (Δ%T) of 34%, as measured at the longer
wavelength absorption maximum (λabs2 = 648 nm) of the
polymer. The device undergoes only minor contrast variations
over 55,000 cycles, maintaining a transmittance contrast value
of 29% at the end of the experiment and demonstrating an
impressive cycle life with over ca. 85% of contrast retained.
■CONCLUSIONS
Following donor−acceptor principles, a series of low band gap
polymer electrochromes composed of electron-rich 3,4-dioxy-
thiophene (DOT) units and the electron-deficient core 2,1,3-
benzothiadiazole (BTD) were rationally designed to establish
molecular structure effects, redox properties, and electrochromic
performance correlations relevant to this class of materials. In
particular, “unbridged” dialkoxythiophenes (DalkOTs), so far
only marginally utilized in the field of organic electronics, were
incorporated in a number of repeat units as an alternative to 3,4-
propylenedioxy-bridged thiophenes (ProDOTs), a class of
increasingly attractive building blocks in the design of high-
performing polymer electrochromes. Interestingly, DalkOT-,
ProDOT-, and mixed DOT-based systems were found to exhibit
comparable short-term redox switching properties and electro-
chromic contrasts. Nonetheless, the long-term switching stability
of the ProDOT-co-BTD system was found to be superior to that
of its polymeric analog relying on DalkOTs −exhibiting less
than 15% of electrochromic loss over 20,000 switching cycles. In
a window-type ECD, the same ProDOT-co-BTD system showed
remarkable long-term switching properties, with over ca. 85% of
contrast retained over 55,000 cycles. Considering that the sub-
stitution pattern of solubilizing side groups may critically impact
the outcome of long-term stability experiments, it should not be
excluded that, upon further optimization, low band gap electro-
chromes relying on DalkOTs can be used as alternatives to their
ProDOT-based counterparts in electrochemical device applica-
tions. To date, ProDOT remains a keystone of electrochromic
polymer development.
