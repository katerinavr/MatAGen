Identiﬁcation of relevant structure–property relationships on solution-processable conjugated polymers
have been shown to improve the performance of various redox active devices. While most research
eﬀorts have focused on the conjugated backbone, less focus has been given to the relative impact of side
chain structure. Here, we report a side chain variation study tuning the optoelectronic properties on a
series of 3,4-dioxythiophene-based polymers with a common conjugated backbone and diﬀering alkyl
side chains. Using a range of analysis methods, it was determined that changing from linear to branched
alkyl side chains aﬀects ionization potential, optical bandgap, perceived color, electrochromic contrast,
switching speed, and switching stability. Speciﬁcally, the polymers with branched side chains have higher
onsets of oxidation and optical bandgaps, and demonstrate sudden coloration change compared to poly-
mers bearing linear side chains. This work provides a foundation for establishing structure–property
relationships on the eﬀects of alkyl side chains on the next generation of electrochromic conjugated
polymers.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers have developed rapidly due to their
promising applications in low-cost, lightweight, and flexible
electronics, such as organic field-eﬀect transistors (OFETs),1,2
light-emitting
diodes
(OLEDs),3,4
organic
photovoltaics
(OPVs),5,6 and electrochromic devices (ECDs).7–9 Numerous
systems have been developed and the performance of conju-
gated polymers has steadily improved and commercial appli-
cations are seemingly imminent. This is especially true in the
field of organic photovoltaics, where power conversion eﬃcien-
cies exceeding 15% have been achieved,10,11 in part due to an
improved understanding of how polymer backbones and side
chains can be engineered for better device performance.12,13
In parallel, solution-processable dioxythiophene (XDOT) based
polymers have been extensively researched for ECDs14,15 due to
their wide color range (optical band gap), low oxidation
potentials, and high optical contrast between their vibrantly
colored charge neutral states and their transmissive oxidized
states.16,17 Through backbone engineering, a series of poly-
mers representing the complete color palette with fast switch-
ing times, low switching voltage, and long-term switching
stability have been achieved.16,18–24 However, beyond proces-
sing considerations, the eﬀects of side chains on the pro-
perties of electrochromic polymers has only been minimally
investigated.25–28
An early attempt to understand the influence of side chains
on the optoelectronic properties of XDOT polymers was per-
formed in 1998.29 This study focused on alkyl-substituted and
unsubstituted poly(3,4-alklenedioxythiophene)s, where the size
of the alkylenedioxy ring or the side chains were varied. It was
shown that increasing the ring size, or the size of the side
chains, influenced the electrochromic contrast and the electro-
chromic switching time. However, it was diﬃcult to diﬀeren-
tiate which eﬀects could be attributed to the size of the brid-
ging ring, and which were purely the result of side chain diﬀer-
ences. In 2004, four new ProDOT-based polymers, synthesized
by Grignard metathesis, were reported.30 In this study, the size
of the alkylenedioxy ring was consistent across all polymers,
while the side chains were either linear or branched. The
polymer films were able to switch reversibly from purple/
magenta charge neutral state to a transmissive sky-blue state
upon oxidation with sub-second switching times and electro-
chromic contrasts at the absorption maximum (λmax) ranging

from 40–70%. The study revealed that polymers in this system
with branched side chains had faster switching times when
compared to the polymers with linear side chains. In 2011, a
similar study was conducted by the Sotzing group31 who
reported four polymers with the same 3,4-propylenedioxy ring,
but varied side chain structures. The polymers with tert-butyl,
hexyl, isopropyl, and methyl groups as the side chains dis-
torted the backbone planarity to varying degrees, resulting in
polymers films with colors ranging from yellow to purple.
The first study to focus on side chains eﬀects in acyclic
dioxythiophenes (AcDOTs) was reported in 2010.32 The homo-
polymer of 3,4-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-thiophene, P(BAcDOT), and
a random copolymer of 3,4-bis(2-ethylhexyloxy)-thiophene and
3,4-dimethoxythiophene (DMT), P(BAcDOT-DMT), were syn-
thesized by oxidative polymerization. The branched alkoxy side
chains on the P(BAcDOT) were reported to distort the back-
bone planarity, resulting in an orange colored neutral polymer
with an optical band gap of 2.04 eV and a λmax at 483 nm. On
the other hand, the random incorporation of DMT units into
the backbone relaxed the steric interactions, red-shifting the
λmax significantly to 525 nm, resulting in a red-colored
polymer. A bit surprisingly, the red-colored polymer had a
more rapid switching speed of 2.3 seconds (measured at 95%
of the full switch, t95), while the orange-colored polymer had a
slower switching speed of 5.3 seconds. Regarding ProDOT-
based polymers, larger substituents at the 2-position of the
propylene bridge have been shown to enhance electrochromic
contrast by minimizing charge carrier (polaron and bipolaron)
band tailing into the visible region from the NIR and improves
switching speeds by promoting more eﬀective counter ion
diﬀusion through the film.30,33 With this logic, the orange
polymer was expected to have a faster switching time and
higher electrochromic contrast. It is conundrums such as this
that we set out to address in the present study.
To further our understanding of how side chains aﬀect the
redox and electronic properties in polymeric XDOTs, a series
of AcDOT homopolymers and copolymers with linear and/or
branched side chains were designed and synthesized. Within
this family, three of the materials were designed to have (i) an
AcDOT conjugated backbone, (ii) the same number of carbon
atoms (eight) in the alkoxy side chains, and (iii) diﬀerent ratios
of linear and branched side chains. To gain insight into the
eﬀect of the side chain steric interactions on the redox and
associated optoelectronic properties, the linear and branched
AcDOT monomers were copolymerized with 3,3-dimethyl-
3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine (DMP). DMP was
chosen because polymers based on this repeat unit have
shown an especially high color contrast, long term redox
cyclability, and the possibility of a coplanar backbone as seen
in the dimer biDMP.27,34,35
As illustrated in Scheme 1, it was hypothesized that:
(i) branched side chains would induce torsional strain
between aromatic rings due to the large van der Waals radii
in the branching position,22 (ii) this strain would lead to a
decrease in the eﬀective conjugation length, giving rise to
higher energy (lower wavelength) absorption transitions, and
(iii) in DMP copolymers of branched AcDOT systems, steric
interactions would be reduced, resulting in an increased
eﬀective conjugation length and a bathochromic shift of the
optical transition. This principle has been demonstrated for
discreate
chromophore
materials
containing
branched
ProDOTs and AcDOT via DFT calculations, demonstrating the
larger degree of backbone torsion as a result of the BAcDOT
unit relative to a ProDOT.36 In this work a linear AcDOT unit
(LAcDOT) was investigated and compared to its branched
counterpart.
Results and discussion
Polymerization
The monomers were synthesized through a transetherification
route reacting 3,4-dimethoxythiophene with the appropriate
alcohol in the presence of a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic
acid (p-TSA), as detailed in the ESI.† The polymers having the
repeat unit structures shown in Scheme 1, were synthesized via
direct (hetero)arylation polymerization (DHAP) or oxidative
polymerization; detailed synthetic routes are outlined in the
Scheme 1
Chemical structures of the XDOT polymers synthesized via either direct (hetero)arylation polymerization or oxidative polymerization,
with varying steric interactions between adjacent units.

ESI,† where the 1H NMR (Fig. S1†) and elemental analyses
correspond to the expected repeat unit structure. The mole-
cular weights of the polymers were estimated by gel per-
meation chromatography (GPC) in either tetrahydrofuran
(THF) or chloroform (CHCl3) (Fig. S2†). The results, summar-
ized in Table 1, indicated that the polymers are of suﬃcient
molecular weight (Mn ranging from 5 kDa to 44 kDa) where
optical properties are expected to become independent of
molecular weight.37 The range in molecular weights of the
polymers synthesized in this work can be attributed to
diﬀerences in their solubility, as dictated by the side chain
and backbone structure. The lower molecular weight of
P(LAcDOT-DMP), relative to the other polymers, is due to the
decreased conformational entropy of the LAcDOT and DMP
units, resulting in a lower overall solubility of the copolymer
and gelation in the reaction medium, thus limiting the propa-
gation of the polymer chains. The high molecular weight of
P(BAcDOT), on the other hand, is attributed to the branched
side chains which allows higher molecular weight chains to
form without gelation.
Redox and optical properties
To investigate the electrochemical properties of the series, the
polymers were dissolved in toluene at 1.0 mg mL−1, except for
P(LAcDOT) which was dissolved in toluene at 0.5 mg mL−1.
From these solutions, 4.0 μL (8 μL for P(LAcDOT)) of each solu-
tion was drop-cast on glassy carbon electrodes, allowed to dry,
and electrochemically cycled between −0.5 V and 0.8 V (vs. Ag/
Ag+) twenty-five times to condition the films to the influx of
electrolyte (referred to as electrochemical annealing, or break-
in).38 After repeated electrochemical cycling, the polymers are
thought to assume their lowest energy conformation in their
charge neutral states. Following the electrochemical break-in,
the films were used to determine the onset of oxidation by
diﬀerential pulse voltammetry (DPV), with the results pre-
sented in Table 2 and Fig. S3a, b.†
From the results in Table 2, it is apparent that the onset of
oxidation can be readily controlled by increasing the steric
interaction through branched side chains. To understand the
results, first focus on the P(LAcDOT), P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT), and
P(BAcDOT) series, which are expected to show progressively
more steric interactions by the incorporation of a higher com-
position of branched side chains. In this series, the Eox
increases from +0.05 V to +0.25 V, then to +0.33 V. The increase
in oxidation potential is primarily attributed to the steric hin-
drance from the branched side chains, which cause the thio-
phene rings to partly twist out of the plane, even in their elec-
trochemically annealed state. This results in a greater ioniza-
tion potential, thus requiring a higher voltage to oxidize the
material.21–23 The same trend is preserved when the BAcDOT
and LAcDOT monomers are copolymerized with DMP, as seen
in Fig. S3b.† P(LAcDOT-DMP) has an oxidation potential at
−0.30 V, while the oxidation onset for P(BAcDOT-DMP) is
+0.01 V. Looking more closely, it is apparent that the polymers
with DMP have an overall lower onset of oxidation when com-
pared to polymers comprised exclusively of AcDOT units. The
diﬀerence in oxidation potential can be explained as an intri-
cate, yet subtle, interplay of steric and electronic factors in the
π-system. Broadly speaking, the DMP unit is more electron-
rich, and less sterically hindered, when compared to the
AcDOT unit due to the propylene bridge in the DMP, hence the
overall
lower
onsets
of
oxidation
in
the
DMP-based
materials.39–41 This trend can also be seen in the cyclic voltam-
mograms (CVs) shown in Fig. S3c and d.† The P(BAcDOT) and
P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT) demonstrate unusually well-defined oxi-
dation and reduction peaks in their CVs. It is hypothesized
that this is due to the higher electrochemical potentials
required to overcome the steric interactions induced by the
branched chains. The P(LAcDOT) shows a somewhat broader
and less defined CV, as is typical of conjugated polymers.
Introduction of the DMP unit not only lowers the onsets of oxi-
dation for both copolymers, but also increases the breadth of
the electroactive response of the film.27
To allow for direct comparison of the optical switching pro-
perties between several films, measurements of optical density
rather than film thickness was used.32,42 Once the polymer
was spray cast to a thickness corresponding to an approximate
absorbance of ∼1.0, the films were electrochemically con-
ditioned for 25 CV cycles. After conditioning, some of the
absorbance profiles were red-shifted relative to the pristine, as
shown through photography in Fig. 1a and Fig. S4.† After
break-in, the normalized spectra of each film in its charge
neutral state, shown in Fig. 1b, were compared for more
insight into the structural diﬀerences imparted by the specific
side chain structure. It should be noted that, while the all
AcDOT polymers show optical changes upon breaking-in, the

DMP copolymers show minimal change, as seen in Fig. 1a and
S4.† The optical band gaps follow the expected trend based on
steric interactions resulting from branched side chain content.
From this trend, P(BAcDOT), an orange polymer with a λmax at
466
nm
is
the
most
blue-shifted.
This
is
followed
by
P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT), a pink-colored polymer with 50% linear
side chains and a λmax at 535 nm, and P(LAcDOT), a purple-
colored polymer with 100% linear side chains and a λmax at
551 nm. Copolymerization of the AcDOT monomers with DMP
resulted in polymers that absorb at lower energies (longer
wavelength of light) than the homopolymers, which is consist-
ent with the electrochemical results. All of the polymers
studied exhibit desirable electrochromic contrast, between
54% and 73% at λmax, as shown in Fig. 1c and Table 3, switch-
ing from a vibrant colored state to a highly transmissive state.
Examining Fig. 1c it is evident that all of the polymers are
able to transition to NIR-absorbing states with minimal
absorption in the visible spectrum when oxidized as desired
for eﬀective electrochromic properties. It is important to note
that P(BAcDOT), the polymer with the most blue-shifted absor-
bance spectrum, has the strongest tailing of the NIR bipolaron
absorption into the visible region of the spectrum, resulting in
a perceptible pale blue color in the fully oxidized state. This
tailing of the bipolaron into the visible region is decreased as
more linear side chains are incorporated for the all AcDOT
polymers, with P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT) and P(LAcDOT) showing
progressively less tailing. However, when the AcDOT mono-
mers are copolymerized with DMP, the results do not follow
the same trend. In the oxidized state, the long wavelength
absorption
from
the
more
sterically
hindered
polymer
P(BAcDOT-DMP) exhibits less tailing than P(LAcDOT-DMP).
The reason for this inconsistency in the amount of tailing is
currently not understood as the bipolaron peak is not directly
observed, only the higher energy side of the absorbance, and
tuning polaron and bipolaron absorbance profiles has not
been studied.
A full spectroelectrochemical analysis was carried out on all
of the polymers in order to probe the applicability of the
materials as electrochromic polymers (ECPs). During the spec-
troelectrochemical measurement, the desired potential was
applied to the film and held at that potential to reach a steady
state prior to taking a spectrum, then increased in 0.1 V incre-
ments from −0.5 V to +1.1 V, the highest stable potential as
determined by CV. Comparing the spectroelectrochemical
results in Fig. 2 and S5,† all of the polymers with the
branched side chains (Fig. 2b, c, and S5a†) exhibit a large
optical change in both the visible and NIR over a narrow
potential step window of ∼0.1 V. These sudden changes for
P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT), P(BAcDOT), and P(BAcDOT-DMP) occur
between +0.3 and +0.4 V, +0.4 and +0.5 V, and 0.0 and 0.1 V,

respectively, indicating this eﬀect is not due to the ease or
diﬃculty of polymer oxidation. This “jump” in optical density
diﬀers from the polymers with linear side chains, P(LAcDOT)
and P(LAcDOT-DMP), where the oxidation proceeds more
gradually as a function of potential, as seen in Fig. 2a and
S5b.† This sudden optical change in absorbance has been
observed in other polymer systems.32,43,44 and may be due to a
cooperative intramolecular domino eﬀect similar to the “twis-
tons” eﬀect, which can be considered delocalized confor-
mation defects.22,32,45,46 In the neutral state, the polymer exists
in a nonplanar (less conjugated) form. When a small positive
potential is initially applied, the polymer chain resists planari-
zation. However, as the applied potential is increased, loca-
lized planarization begins to occur, which has a cooperative
domino eﬀect on neighboring repeat units, resulting in a
sudden change in color.47,48
A careful comparison of the spectroelectrochemical data for
the polymers reveals that steric interactions from the side
chains influence the presence of aggregation features in the
solid state. P(LAcDOT) has three distinct aggregation peaks at
513 nm, 551 nm, and 598 nm while P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT) has
two aggregation peaks at 535 nm and 583 nm. When the
branched
side
chain
content
is
increased
to
100%
in
P(BAcDOT), the resulting absorbance spectra do not show any
aggregation
features.
The
same
trend
is
seen
in
P(LAcDOT-DMP) and P(BAcDOT-DMP), where P(BAcDOT-DMP)
shows a decrease in aggregation as well as a decrease in the
intensity of the peaks. This result supports the postulation
that the presence of aggregated structures occurs in more
ordered films and that steric interactions can be used to tune
order/disorder in conjugated polymers. Furthermore, spectro-
electrochemical
data
suggested
preferential
doping
of
H-aggregated species when the ratio of the 0–0, and 0–1 tran-
sitions is compared during oxidation.49,50
One of the most important parameters used to characterize
and consider the applicability of an ECP is color, however,
color is subjective to interpretation since the perception of
color varies between individuals. For valid comparisons, the
CIE L*a*b system was used to track the changes in color
during the oxidation process. Fig. 2d shows the change in the
a*b* hue and saturation as the ECPs are sequentially oxidized.
High values of a* and b*, initially in the as-sprayed state of the
neutral polymers, is indicative of a vibrantly colored material.
Upon electrochemical conditioning, the polymer chains reor-
ganize as they dope and dedope, leading to color changes for
the neutral states as shown by the second point of a* and b*.

This eﬀect is most drastic in P(BAcDOT-DMP), where the as-
sprayed polymer has b* = +10 and a* = +60; after electro-
chemical switching, the color coordinates change to b* = −20
and a* = +50 resulting in a color change from magenta to
purple. This change is also reflected in shifts in λmax and
Eg,opt. After electrochemical conditioning, the potential is
increased by 0.1 V and the color at each potential is recorded.
Increasing the potential leads to the (a*,b*) values approaching
the origin, which indicates that the polymers are becoming
progressively more transmissive. Also evident in these results
is the jump in the polymer’s transmissivity in the cases where
the material converted from the colored to transmissive form
over a narrow potential range.
To determine how the side chains aﬀect the switching kine-
tics in spray-cast films, the Δ%T was monitored as a function
of time during the application of a square wave potential.51
The potential square waves were executed between −0.5 V
(neutral state) and +0.8 V (fully oxidized state) with various
potential residence times of 60 s, 30 s,10 s, 2 s, 1 s, followed by
another 30 s, as shown in Fig. S6a–e.† The switching speeds
for the polymers were reported as the time required for the
polymer to reach 95% of full contrast upon bleaching and
coloring during the 60 s switching period, as shown in
Fig. S6f.† Comparing these results in Table 3, the polymers
switched from colored to bleached in 1.8 s to 3.6 s, and
bleached to colored in 1.8 s to 10.6 s. With the exception of
P(LAcDOT-DMP), the polymers have faster bleaching than
coloration. It is hypothesized that coloration of the polymer is
slower due to the injection of electrons during reduction to
charge balance the polymer at the polymer electrode interface,
making it insulating and slowing dedoping of the rest of the
film. Taking a closer look at the switching speeds, P(LAcDOT)
has the fastest coloring time of 2.5 s. Increasing the steric
interaction by incorporating 50% of the branched side chains
increases the coloring time to 4.3 s. When the polymer has
100% branched side chain, the coloring time is even slower at
10.6 s. The reason for this slow coloration is currently not
understood, however, we hypothesize it is a result of poor elec-
tronic/ionic transport through the P(BAcDOT) film close to the
electrode as charges are being removed from the polymer
chains, eﬀectively acting as a contact resistance. Branched side
chains have been shown to result in larger charge transfer
resistances compared to linear side chains.27 When the AcDOT
monomers are copolymerized with DMP, the overall coloring
time is faster as compared to the other three AcDOT polymers,
but the material with the branched side chains still has a
slower coloring time. While the structure–property relation-
ships aﬀecting switching speed are not fully understood, there
are several consistent trends among the AcDOT and ProDOT
family. Polymers containing branched AcDOTs display slow
redox switching between the reduced and oxidized states,
while polymers containing ProDOTs are typically faster.23
As
stated
earlier,
previous
studies
involving
AcDOTs
have reported poor performance regarding redox stability,
sometimes
observed
through
film
delamination
upon
switching.22,32,41,44 It is unclear if this instability stems from
the fact that the structure lacks a protective bridge, as in
ProDOT and EDOT, or if it originates from the branched side
chains. To answer this question, the long-term switching stabi-
lity of P(LAcDOT) was tested. A spray-cast film of P(LAcDOT)
was prepared and placed in a three-electrode cell using the
same setup as the spectroelectrochemical studies. The electro-
lyte solution (0.5 M TBAPF6/PC) was degassed via argon bub-
bling for ten minutes before the working electrode, reference
electrode, and counter electrode were added. The absorption
spectra of P(LAcDOT) in the neutral state was taken at −0.5 V
and then at its fully transmissive state 0.8 V, as shown in Fig. 3
as black lines. The film was then switched between 0.5 to 0.8 V
as shown in Fig. S7† for 1000 cycles with a residence time of
10 s at each applied potential. Spectra of the neutral and oxi-
dized states were recorded again after the 1000 cycles and are
shown in Fig. 3 as red lines. Extracting the Δ%T values from
the chronoabsorptiometry plot shows no change in contrast.
This result demonstrates that AcDOT polymers with linear side
chains can have stability above 1000 cycles, comparable to
ProDOT and PheDOT systems,44 and proves that the short
switching lifetime of AcDOTs shown in the past was more
likely due to the branched side polymers requiring a high oxi-
dation potential and not due the lack of a “protective bridge”.
Aggregation eﬀects and thermal properties
The optical spectra of conjugated polymers are complicated by
absorbances from inter-chain aggregated and unaggregated
species. Evaluating P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT) as an example in
Fig. S8b,† the polymer is fully dissolved in dilute solution.
There, the absorbance arises solely from intra-chain and non-
aggregated excitations giving rise to a broad single peak. In the
solid state, where the P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT) is densely packed,
absorbances arise from aggregation of the polymer. This is
evident by the two distinct absorption peaks and a red-shift in
absorbance with respect to the solution spectra. On the other
hand, the absorption profile of P(LAcDOT) shown in Fig. S8a,†

Absorbance spectra of P(LAcDOT) recorded before and after
1000 cycles in the charge neutral (−0.5 V) and oxidized state (+0.8 V) in
0.5 M TBAPF6/PC.

even in a dilute solution, is nearly identical to that observed in
a solid film indicating ordered aggregates. In essence, this
result indicates that linear side chains in P(LAcDOT) allows
the polymer to form strong π–π stacks in solution at 25 °C,
resembling the molecular geometry of the highly ordered
polymer chains found in solid films. This result was surprising
since most XDOT polymers have featureless absorption pro-
files in dilute solutions.
To answer the question of what causes the formation of
ordered
structures
in
P(LAcDOT)
solutions,
temperature-
dependent UV-Vis measurements in toluene were performed.
Even though the polymers dissolve more readily in chloroform
than in toluene, toluene was chosen because it has a higher
boiling point than chloroform, which allows the study of solu-
tions over a wider temperature range. The polymer solutions
were first heated to 105 °C, the temperature at which each
polymer is truly molecularly dissolved. This is evident by the
featureless and broad spectra shown in Fig. S8,† which is
attributed to disordered chain conformations in non-interact-
ing states. The polymers were then cooled to room temperature
in increments of 10 °C allowing the solutions to thermally
equilibrate at each temperature for ten minutes before each
absorption spectrum was recorded. For P(LAcDOT) at the start-
ing temperature of 105 °C, the spectrum has one broad peak
with a λmax = 510 nm. Upon cooling from 105 °C to 75 °C the
broad absorption red-shifted and concurrently gained intensity
(dashed lines in Fig. S5a†). The red shifts and increase in
intensity are attributed to the planarization of the disordered
chains that leads to an increase in conjugation length.52
Decreasing the temperature to 55 °C, the absorption in the
higher energy region of the spectrum decreases, while three
distinct aggregation peaks appear at lower energy. These aggre-
gation peaks have been attributed to ordered chains in an
aggregated phase.52 Below 55 °C, the absorption spectrum
undergoes the most significant changes. The three distinct
aggregation peaks gain intensity and red-shift; this is indicated
by peaks with λmax = 610 nm and λmax = 540 nm with a
shoulder peak at 510 nm. This red-shift in the absorption is
associated with a further planarization of the aggregated
chains.52 The P(BAcDOT) and P(LAcDOT-BAcDOT) also red-
shift as the temperature is cooled to room temperature,
however the polymers do not form aggregates as the feature
progression is not observed, as shown in Fig. S8b and c.† Both
DMP containing polymers show aggregation features between
560 and 580 nm, as seen in Fig. S8d and e,† albeit less pro-
nounced than those seen in P(LAcDOT) and these aggregates
are fully broken up by ∼75 °C.
The distinct diﬀerence between P(LAcDOT) and the other
polymers
observed
in
the
temperature-dependent
UV-vis
studies prompted us to carry out the thermal studies on all
five polymers in the solid state. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed to determine their decomposition temp-
eratures, and diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used
to probe for thermal transitions. TGA was carried out using a
heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 50 °C to 600 °C while main-
taining the chamber under nitrogen. All of the polymers
exhibited a high degree of thermal stability to 250 °C with a
5% weight loss in the range of 300 °C to 325 °C, as shown
in Fig. S9.† DSC was measured three times at a rate
of 10 °C min−1 from −50 °C to temperatures below their
decomposition. The first cycle was used to erase the thermal
history and remove inconsistencies in the results, while the
second and third cycles were used to establish reproducibly
and stability. As evident in Fig. 4, the third cycle thermograms
for P(LAcDOT) show a distinct melting peak temperature at
169 °C and a crystallization peak temperature at 149 °C, while
the thermograms of the other polymers are featureless. These
peaks are a further indication of the strong intermolecular
ordering of P(LAcDOT).
Conclusion and discussion
Understanding the eﬀects of side chains of electrochromic
polymers is critical to the development of high-performance
devices. Prior to this work, the structural impact of acyclic
dioxythiophenes has only been marginally studied in terms of
electrochromism, especially when compared to their more
popular ProDOT-based counterparts. Here, it is demonstrated
that varying side chain structure significantly aﬀected solubi-
lity, the onset of oxidation, perceived color, switching speed,
electrochromic contrast, and long-term switching stability.
Furthermore, varying the side chains from linear to branched
decreased interchain interactions in the conjugated polymers
and reduced their propensity for aggregation in solution, as
shown by temperature dependent UV-vis spectroscopy, which
extended to DSC observable crystallinity in P(LAcDOT). This
property combination ultimately led to a high degree of switch-
ing stability, important to consider for possible applications
in electrochromic applications. Overall, these results illustrate
that side chains can and do dramatically influence the redox
