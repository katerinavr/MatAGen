ABSTRACT: We report on the synthesis and morphology of
a block copolymer, poly(3-(2′-ethylhexyl)thiophene)-b-poly-
(ethylene oxide) (P3EHT-b-PEO), that conducts both
electrons and ions. We show that in the melt state the
P3EHT-b-PEO chains self-assemble to produce traditional
nanoscale morphologies such as lamellae and gyroid. This is in
contrast to a majority of previous studies on copolymers with
electronically conducting blocks wherein a nanoﬁbrillar
morphology is obtained. Our approach enables estimation of
the Flory−Huggins interaction parameter, χ. The segregation
strength between the two blocks is controlled through the
addition of lithium bis(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTF-
SI). For the salt-free sample, the gyroid morphology, obtained in the melt state, is transformed into lamellae below the melting
temperature of the P3EHT block. This is due to the “breaking out” of the crystalline phase. For the salt-containing sample,
P3EHT-b-PEO has a lamellar morphology in both melt and crystalline states (conﬁned crystallization).

anostructuring of electronically conducting domains is
important for a wide range of applications related to
clean energy. Organic solar cells require nanoscale electron-
and hole-conducting domains to promote charge separation
and extraction.1 Battery and fuel cell electrodes based on active
materials that are either electronic or ionic insulators (e.g.,
lithium iron phosphate or platinum) require nanoscale
electron- and ion-conducting domains.2,3 Copolymers with
electronically conducting block such as poly(3-alkylthiophenes)
(P3AT) appear to be perfectly suited for such applications.4 It
is thus not surprising that many research groups have focused
on the synthesis and characterization of block copolymers
containing P3AT.5−8 The formation of nanoscale domains such
as alternating lamellae and the cubic gyroid phase in block
copolymers9 is well established, and such morphologies are
ideally suited for the applications listed above. Unfortunately,
the crystallization of most electronically conducting polymers
disrupts these morphologies; a vast majority of publications on
P3AT report the formation of crystalline nanoﬁbrils with no
evidence of conventional domain morphologies seen in block
copolymers.5−8 Notable exceptions are the reports from Ho et
al.10 and Moon et al.,11 who report the formation of
conventional morphologies in a P3AT-containing block
copolymers that have reduced melting temperatures. The
common feature in these studies is that the nonconducting
blocks have a high glass transition temperature, and the inability
of glassy polymers to conduct either electrons or ions is well
established.
This paper demonstrates the formation of lamellae and
gyroid morphologies in a poly(3-(2′-ethylhexyl)thiophene)-b-
poly(ethylene oxide) (P3EHT-b-PEO) copolymer. The
P3EHT block has a molecular weight of 5 kg/mol, and the
PEO block has a molecular weight of 2 kg/mol (we see no
evidence of PEO crystals in our experimental window). We also
show that the morphology is aﬀected by the addition of lithium
bis(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), a salt that is
commonly used in the ﬁeld of polymer electrolytes. We provide
thermodynamic data that represent the starting point for
predicting the morphologies of these systems. The distinguish-

ing feature of our study is the rubbery nature of PEO-rich
microphases which enables ion transport, thus allowing for
simultaneous conduction of electronic and ionic charges.
A framework has been established to predict the self-
assembly of copolymers with one nonconducting crystallizable
block and one amorphous block.12−21 The morphology
obtained in these systems is dictated by the chemical
incompatibility of the two blocks (χ, Flory−Huggins interaction
parameter), the free energy of crystallization, and the glass
transition temperature of the amorphous block.12−21 When the
amorphous block is glassy, the morphology of the melt state is
retained and the crystallization of the second block is conﬁned
within the nanoscale domains.14,16,19,22 When the amorphous
block is rubbery, the morphology in the crystalline state
depends on both segregation strength (χN, where N is the
number of monomers per chain) between the blocks and the
free energy of crystallization.12,14,16,18 The melt-state morphol-
ogy is retained only in strongly segregated systems.16−18 In
weakly segregated systems, the crystalline phase “breaks out” of
the conﬁning block copolymer domain.12−14,18,20,21 The
breakout morphology of the crystalline phase is often lamellar
as this geometry is commensurate with that of chain folded
crystals.12,14,21,23,24 This was ﬁrst anticipated by theorists23,24
and subsequently observed experimentally.12−14,21 The ther-
modynamic properties of our P3EHT-b-PEO block copolymer
are consistent with this general framework.
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is a highly studied semi-
crystalline polymer system due to its high electronic charge
carrier mobility.25,26 P3HT has a high melting temperature
(<230 °C) and is dominated by crystallization through strong
π−π interactions. As a result, the morphology of P3HT-
containing block copolymers have nanoﬁbrillar superstruc-
ture.5−8 Variations in the alkyl side chain of the thiophene
block can have a large eﬀect on the crystalline and liquid
crystalline properties of P3ATs. For example, poly(3-
dodecylthiophene) (P3DDT) has a lower melting point (160
°C) and reduced rod−rod interactions relative to P3HT.27
Moon et al. show that one can obtain traditional block
copolymer morphologies with P3DDT-b-poly(methyl meth-
acrylate) (P3DDT-b-PMMA) by varying the molecular weight
of P3DDT and PMMA, thus controlling the segregation
strength.11 The nanoﬁbril morphology is only obtained when
the total molecular weight is reduced and P3DDT is the
majority block. Importantly, the crystalline nature of P3DDT is
retained in the nanoscale domains for the whole composition
window.
In addition to P3HT and P3DDT, the introduction of a
branched alkyl side chain, such as in poly(3-(2′-ethylhexyl)-
thiophene) (P3EHT), causes the polymer to have an even
lower melting temperature (80 °C) and reduced rod−rod
interactions.27 The P3EHT homopolymers and P3EHT-
containing block copolymers10 have been shown to crystallize
similarly to P3HT by forming the π−π stacked polymer
chains27 and also has comparable optical and charge transport
properties to those of P3HT.10,27,28 The use of a P3AT
derivative with a lowered crystallization temperature can aﬀect
the self-assembly of P3EHT rod−coil block copolymers. Ho et
al. have observed traditional block copolymer morphologies
with a P3EHT-b-polylactide (P3EHT-b-PLA) system.10 This
result is consistent with the framework described above;
conﬁned crystallization can be attributed to the low
crystallization temperature of P3EHT, the glassy nature of
the noncrystalline block, and the strong segregation strength
between the two blocks.
We present a facile approach for synthesizing P3EHT-b-PEO
copolymers that combines Grignard metathesis (GRIM)
polymerization and click chemistry (Figure 1a).29 An ethynyl-
terminated P3EHT homopolymer was ﬁrst synthesized

followed by coupling with an azide-terminated PEO homopol-
ymer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-ﬂight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was employed to
determine the end-group composition of the end-capped
P3EHT, and a representative spectrum is shown in the
Supporting Information. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
time that the end-capping methodology with the GRIM
mechanism has been used for P3EHT block copolymer
synthesis. Figure 1b shows the size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) traces of the two homopolymers and the block
copolymer. The formation of the block copolymer is evidenced
by the diﬀerence in elution volume between the P3EHT
homopolymer and the P3EHT-b-PEO copolymer traces (see
Supporting Information for more details). This is further
conﬁrmed by
1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)
spectroscopy, which shows the disappearance of the ethynyl
proton peak (see Supporting Information).
Figure 2a shows diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data
for neat P3EHT-b-PEO (r = 0, where r is the molar ratio of Li+
to ethylene oxide monomer). The neat sample was held at 30
°C for 90 min prior to heating to allow for the complete
crystallization of the P3EHT block. Melting peaks at 64 and 77
°C are observed, consistent with previous reports.28 PEO
chains in the P3EHT-b-PEO do not crystallize in the
temperature window of interest, 25−160 °C. Consequently,
no melting peak for PEO is observed in Figure 2a (refer to
Supporting Information for additional DSC data related to
PEO crystallization). Figure 2b shows the wide-angle X-ray
scattering (WAXS) for neat P3EHT-b-PEO, which was held at
28 °C for 90 min. The resulting scattering peaks are consistent
with previously published WAXS data on P3EHT, where the
sharp peak at 0.44 nm−1 corresponds to the (100) plane (side-
chain packing). The scattering peaks for crystalline PEO are not
observed, conﬁrming that the P3EHT block is the only
crystallized component. The introduction of the LiTFSI salt at
a concentration of r = 0.125 leads to much weaker melting
peaks in the DSC data (Figure 2c) at 65 and 81 °C. Increasing
the isothermal crystallization time from 3 to 8 h results in an
increase in intensity of the melting peaks and a small decrease
in the melting temperatures to 62 and 76 °C. The longer
crystallization time required for the salt-containing sample was
further conﬁrmed through WAXS, where the scattering peaks
could only be seen after annealing at 28 °C for 12 h (Figure
2d). Both the DSC and WAXS data suggest that the
crystallization kinetics of the P3EHT block is aﬀected by the
addition of salt. Previous studies on P3HT containing block
copolymers indicate some LiTFSI partitions into the P3HT
domain.30 Therefore, it is possible some LiTFSI is partitioning
into the P3EHT domain, which could explain diﬀerent
crystallization properties, particularly the slightly lower melting
temperature.
Figure 3a shows the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
intensity, I, vs the magnitude of the scattering vector, q, of
P3EHT-b-PEO for r = 0. At 28 and 50 °C, the scattering
proﬁles indicate two broad shoulders that index to q* and 2q*,
where q* is the magnitude of the scattering vector associated
with {100} family of reﬂection planes of a given morphology.
The characteristic domain spacing, d = 2π/qmax, is 15.9 nm,
where qmax is the magnitude of q at the most intense peak (or
the peak that occurs at the lowest value of q). The TEM image
(Figure 3c) of the neat sample indicates a lamellar morphology
with a domain spacing of 15.5 nm. Surprisingly, well-deﬁned
lamellae are observed in the TEM image, which is in contrast
with the broad peaks seen in the SAXS data. At temperatures
above the melting point of P3EHT (90 and 120 °C), the SAXS
scattering proﬁles show two distinct Bragg peaks at √6q* and
√8q*, consistent with the gyroid morphology. The character-
istic domain spacing, d, is 12.3 nm. Further increase of the
temperature to 125 °C leads to a disordered structure at a qmax
of 0.51 nm−1. In the inset of Figure 3a, a plot of the full width at
half-maximum of qmax (fwhm) vs temperature shows a clear
jump in fwhm, which is typical for an order-to-disorder phase
transition (ODT). The ODT is reversible, as evidenced by the
return of the gyroid morphology after the sample was cooled
back down to 90 °C (Figure 3b). This is the ﬁrst evidence of
the existence of an ODT for a P3EHT-containing block
copolymer.
We use the ODT to estimate the value of χ between P3EHT
and PEO. There are currently no literature reports of statistical
segment length of P3EHT chains in the melt state, lEHT. We
apply the random phase approximation to the SAXS data in the
disordered state to obtain lEHT as outlined by Lin et al. (refer to
Supporting Infornmation).31 In the mean-ﬁeld theory the value
of qmax depends on statistical segment lengths only and not on
χ. Thus, knowing the literature value for the statistical segment
length of PEO chains, lEO, 0.72 nm,32 and the value of qmax in
the disordered state, 0.51 nm−1, we obtain lEHT = 1.1 nm. The
statistical segment lengths and χ parameters in this work are

P3EHT block for both r = 0 and r = 0.125 remain semicrystalline as
indicated by the melting peaks in the DSC scans and the (100)
reﬂection in the WAXS proﬁles. PEO block does not crystallize within
our experimental window as indicated by the lack of WAXS peaks
corresponding to PEO crystallites (inset of part b). The P3EHT block
for the r = 0 sample crystallized in 1.5 h, while the r = 0.125 showed a
very weak melting peak in 1.5 h. However, a more pronounced
P3EHT melting peak was observed after 8 h.

based on reference volume of 0.1 nm3. Thus, the conforma-
tional asymmetry factor for our system is lEHT/lEO = 1.5. The
mean-ﬁeld phase diagram for block copolymer with lEHT/lEO =
1.5 and ϕEHT = 0.71 contains a transition from gyroid to
cylinder at χN = 20, a transition to cylinders to spheres at χN =
14.5, and a transition from spheres to disordered at χN = 14.33
However, only a gyroid to disorder transition was observed in
our P3EHT-b-PEO (r = 0) at 125 °C. We thus conclude the
value of χN for our system at 125 °C is between 14 and 20.
Since N = 108, we conclude that 0.13 < χ < 0.19 at 125 °C. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative measurement of χ
between conventional polymers such as PEO and poly(3-
alkylthiophene) chains. This is the ﬁrst step toward prediction
of the morphology of block copolymers containing poly(3-
alkylthiophene) chains.
The above method for determining χ only applies to
conventional block copolymers with Gaussian chains. P3EHT
is, however, a semiﬂexible polymer.10,34 Theoretical work on
the phase behavior of semiﬂexible block copolymers shows that
the value of χN at the ODT for these systems depends on
magnitude of the Maier−Saupé parameter, μ, relative to χ.35−38
The Maier−Saupé parameter quantiﬁes interactions between
rodlike molecules in the mean-ﬁeld limit. The μ value for
P3EHT is 0.01 at 125 °C;34 thus, μ/χ is estimated to be
between 0.052 and 0.076 for our system. The predictions in ref
35 indicate that such a small value of μ/χ has a negligible eﬀect
on the value of χN at the ODT. We note in passing that our
estimate is based entirely on the mean-ﬁeld theory of block
copolymers; i.e., ﬂuctuation corrections39 are ignored.
In Figure 3b, we show the SAXS data for r = 0 during the
cooling run after heating the P3EHT-b-PEO to 150 °C. Unlike
the heating step to 50 °C where lamellar morphology was
observed (Figure 3a), the cooling step to 50 °C shows
retention of the gyroid morphology (Figure 3b). DSC data and
WAXS experiments during cooling runs indicate that P3EHT
does not recrystallize at 50 °C (data not shown). It is not clear
if this observed suppression of crystallization at 50 °C is due to
kinetic factors. Further cooling to 28 °C shows the gyroid
morphology at early times and a lamellar morphology at long
times (Figure 3b). This observation indicates that the
crystallization of P3EHT block destroys the melt-state
morphology. In other words, the P3EHT crystals “break out”
of the conﬁned domains dictated by thermodynamic
segregation of the blocks (χN and ϕEHT). This is due to the
nonglassy nature of the PEO block and the fact that χN is
between 14 and 20; i.e., the system is weakly segregated. The
fact that the breakout structure is lamellar is not completely
unexpected as previous theories23,24 and experiments12−14,21 on
weakly segregated semicrystalline block copolymers show the
crystalline-state morphology is often lamellar regardless of the
melt-state morphology.
Segregation between the blocks can be increased by the
addition of LiTFSI salt to P3EHT-b-PEO. In Figure 4a, the
SAXS proﬁle of the P3EHT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixture with r =
0.125 in the melt state (150 °C) shows the presence of the
lamellar morphology indicated by the Bragg peaks at q*, 2q*,
3q*, and 4q* corresponding to a d of 15.4 nm. The sample was
quenched to 28 °C to allow for the crystallization of P3EHT
block. We see that the lamellar morphology is retained even
after 12 h. However, the Bragg peaks broaden slightly and the
lamellar spacing increases; d increases from 15.4 to 18.3 nm
during the 12 h annealing step. The DSC and WAXS data
shown in Figure 2 indicate that the P3EHT block in the
P3EHT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixture with r = 0.125 crystallizes on
this time scale. We thus attribute the broadening the Bragg
peaks to P3EHT crystallization. A lamellar morphology is also
observed in the TEM image of the P3EHT-b-PEO/LiTFSI
mixture with r = 0.125 shown in Figure 4b, where the
characteristic domain spacing is 17.5 nm. It is evident that the
P3EHT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixture with r = 0.125 exhibits
conﬁned crystallization at room temperature. This is attributed
to an increase in segregation, χN, and the fact that the melt-
state morphology is lamellar. Extrapolation of the data for
polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO)/LiTFSI mix-
tures41 shows that χ increases by a factor of about 7 when r is
increased from 0 to 0.125. Assuming that the thermodynamics
of PS-b-PEO/LiTFSI and P3EHT-b-PEO/LiTFSI systems are
similar, we anticipate that χN is about 100 for P3EHT-b-PEO/
LiTFSI mixture with r = 0.125. The DSC data in Figure 2
indicate that the P3EHT crystals melt in both r = 0 and r =
0.125 samples around 80 °C. In spite of this, the r = 0 sample
crystallizes in 90 min while there is virtually no evidence of
crystallization in the r = 0.125 sample after 90 min of annealing.
The diﬀerence in crystallization kinetics can be attributed to
conﬁnement. The r = 0 sample exhibits breakout crystallization,

P3EHT-b-PEO (r = 0). The inset in (a) is the full width half-maximum
(fwhm) of the primary scattering peak vs T (temperature) curve,
indicating an order-to-disorder phase (ODT) transition. The melt-
state gyroid morphology (90 °C) is destroyed (“breakout”) upon
crystallization of the P3EHT block at 28 °C. The ﬁlled triangles
denote peaks corresponding to the gyroid morphology, and the
unﬁlled triangles denote peaks corresponding to the lamellar
morphology. (c) Bright-ﬁeld transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image of P3EHT-b-PEO (r = 0) shows that the “breakout”
morphology is lamellar at room temperature. Contrast arises from the
higher electron density in the semicrystalline P3EHT (dark phase).

while r = 0.125 sample exhibits conﬁned crystallization.
Previous studies on semicrystalline block copolymers have
shown that breakout crystallization follows sigmoidal kinetics,
while conﬁned crystallization follows ﬁrst-order kinetics.16,42,43
In particular, the crystallization half-time is more highly
dependent on crystallization temperature during conﬁned
crystallization. As a result, varying the temperature for
isothermal crystallization of the r = 0.125 sample could greatly
aﬀect the time needed to fully crystallize the P3EHT block. The
magnitude in time diﬀerence for crystallization (hours)
between r = 0 and r = 0.125 is far greater than previously
reported conﬁned/breakout crystallization behavior in block
copolymers. This could be attributed to the inherent slower
crystallization kinetics of P3EHT. Further work is needed to
fully understand the crystallization kinetics in P3EHT-b-PEO
during conﬁnement and breakout.
In summary, a P3EHT-b-PEO copolymer was synthesized by
producing ethynyl-terminated P3EHT in one step using GRIM
polymerization followed by coupling to an azide-terminated
PEO block through click chemistry. This facile approach may
be used for synthesizing a variety of poly(3-alkylthiophene)-
containing block copolymers. We have demonstrated that the
morphology of this copolymer can be controlled by
thermodynamic parameters such as temperature and segrega-
tion strength (χN). The segregation strength was adjusted by
the addition of LiTFSI salt. In the melt state, the salt-free
sample (r = 0) exhibits a gyroid morphology while the salt-
containing sample (r = 0.125) exhibits a lamellar morphology.
Quenching the salt-free sample to room temperature results in
a lamellar morphology due to the breakout of the P3EHT
crystals. In contrast, there is little change in the morphology of
the salt-containing sample upon quenching to room temper-
ature; i.e., we observed conﬁned crystallization. This qualitative
change is attributed to increase in χN from about 17 to 100.
Finally, this work provides the ﬁrst estimate for the value of χ
between P3AT chains and conventional polymers such as PEO.
