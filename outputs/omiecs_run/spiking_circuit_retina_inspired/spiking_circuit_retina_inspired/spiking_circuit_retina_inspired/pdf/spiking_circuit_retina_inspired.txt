Signal communication mechanisms within the human body rely on the
transmission and modulation of action potentials. Replicating the inter-
dependent functions of receptors, neurons and synapses with organic artiﬁcial
neurons and biohybrid synapses is an essential ﬁrst step towards merging
neuromorphic circuits and biological systems, crucial for computing at the
biological interface. However, most organic neuromorphic systems are based
on simple circuits which exhibit limited adaptability to both external and
internal biological cues, and are restricted to emulate only speciﬁc the func-
tions of an individual neuron/synapse. Here, we present a modular neuro-
morphic system which combines organic spiking neurons and biohybrid
synapses to replicate a neural pathway. The spiking neuron mimics the sensory
coding function of afferent neurons from light stimuli, while the neuromo-
dulatory activity of interneurons is emulated by neurotransmitters-mediated
biohybrid synapses. Combining these functions, we create a modular con-
nection between multiple neurons to establish a pre-processing retinal path-
way primitive.
Neuromorphic computing is currently experiencing a tremendous
increase in research activity. Inspired by neuroscience, it aims to mimic
the functions and architecture of the brain to enable parallel com-
puting with high energy efﬁciency1,2 and local processing3, which
advances edge-computing4, smart robotics5,6 and intelligent systems
interfacing with the human body7,8. However, establishing an active
interaction with biological tissues, especially with the central nervous
system, requires computing systems that are not only able to receive
biologically encoded inputs but also to process and communicate
these, by adapting their processing functions to cues such as neuro-
transmitters and light. The complex sensory systems in the human
body share a coding mechanism based on the frequencymodulation of
action potentials9. The physical perception starts with millions of
highly speciﬁc sensory receptor cells which respond to deﬁnite stimuli
at distinct locations on the body. The intensity of an external stimu-
lation is ﬁrst converted into a receptor potential and then encoded in

the ﬁring frequency of afferent neurons. The direct dependence of the
spike frequency on the magnitude of the stimulus is generally referred
to as sensory coding. The sensory information is then transmitted to
the central nervous system where it is processed through a complex
network of inhibitory/excitatory interneurons that work as computing
units by modulating the spike frequency in parallel10,11.
The circuital design of current spiking circuits is predominantly
based on inorganic materials, particularly on silicon-based devices12,13
(Supplementary Discussion 1, Supplementary Table 1). However, neu-
romorphic applications operating at the biointerface clearly favour
organic materials2,14. Next to their relatively soft and ﬂexible proper-
ties, high tunability and low operational voltage, organic mixed ion-
electron conductors conduct both electrons and ions15. Although
organic non-electrolyte conductors have been previously employed to
build spiking circuits based on organic ﬁeld effect transistors (OFETs),
their lack of ionic conduction (interaction with aqueous electrolytes)
severely limit their applicability towards adaptive neuromorphic
circuits16. Standard OFETs operate in dry conditions and do not require
an electrolyte medium, which in the context of neuromorphic and
smart bioelectronic applications represents the bio-interfaced envir-
onment interacting with the platform17. Moreover, to act as biosensors
these devices usually require surface functionalisation and suffer from
limitations related to low sensitivity and selectivity.
Mixed ionic-electronic conductors allow to build organic elec-
trochemical transistors (OECTs) where ion injection from an electro-
lyte modulates the bulk conductivity of the channel terminal. This
mechanism allows to design neuronal circuits that closely match the
operating timescales of their biological counterparts18, reduce inter-
face impedance19, and mimic ion-based biological functions such as
neuronal ion-ﬂux communication and neurotransmitter-receptor
binding2 (synaptic function), which are required to interact with bio-
logical tissues and to design adaptive biointerfaces20. Recently, organic
materials have been employed to build electronic circuits that mimic
the spiking behaviour of neurons16,21,22. In this context, mixed ionic-
electronic conductors-based neuromorphic devices are emerging due
to their intrinsic ion tunability which elicit a change of their electrical
characteristics23. The distinctive interdependence of these conduction
mechanisms (ionic to electronic) is essential to replicate the chemical
(neurotransmitters) to electrical (action potential) signal transduction
processes in-sensor and is performed by the two key biological ele-
ments considered in this work: synapses and neurons22,24,25. On the
contrary, to perform similar biological functions inorganic and OFETs-
based circuits devices require a large number of circuital elements with
limited tissue adaptation and complex external sensing units. These
require

(ampliﬁcation, reduction, noise control), signiﬁcantly limiting the
reconﬁgurability of the overall circuit26–28.
Despite their ability to process complex sensorial input29,30, the
most recent organic systems operate as stand-alone neurons, trans-
ducing external signals such as light, pressure, temperature, ionic
concentrations etc. into spike patterns, but they lack mechanisms to
transmit the encoded signal to different processing units in the neural
network (Supplementary Discussion 1, Supplementary Table 1). This
signal transmission and modulation is the fundamental property of
interneurons31 and is essential to perform pre-processing functions
and overcome the limit of conventional electronic spiking circuits32,33.
Organic materials can be used to recreate a neuronal network that
relies on the cooperation of spiking elements (afferent neurons and
interneurons) and non-spiking elements such as mechano-chemical
sensors (receptors), as well as neuromodulator junctions (chemical
synapses). In this work, we demonstrate this concept by designing and
fabricating monolithically integrated neuromorphic spiking circuits
(neurons) that are connected through biohybrid (chemical) synapses
to develop a modular system that emulates the biological functions of
a retinal pathway.
Results
A neuromorphic system for sensory coding and
neuromodulation
The organic neuromorphic system is able to replicate the spiking
activity of both afferent neurons (sensory coding through external
stimuli such as light), as well as interneurons (neuromodulation with
neurotransmitters on a biohybrid synapse24), see Fig. 1a. The spiking
neurons are fabricated on a 16 × 16 mm glass slide (see Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Discussion 1). They consist of a pair of ambipolar
inverters (p(C4-T2-C0-EG)34), comprising four OECTs and a resetting
electrochemical transistor (P-3O35). The receptor which includes a light
sensor converts the external stimulus to an input potential that acti-
vates the neuromorphic spiking circuit. The input potential charges
the spiking circuit (through the intrinsic capacitance of the OECTs)
until the transition voltage of the inverter pair is reached. The voltage
inversion triggers the resetting OECT which allows the circuit to dis-
charge and start the next cycle. The fabrication details as well as the
characterisation of both the spiking neuron and the individual devices
can be found in Supplementary Discussion 1.
Figure 1c demonstrates the sensory coding of light stimuli for low
and high ambient light intensity (see Supplementary Discussion 2 for
sensory coding of intermediate intensity light stimuli). We connect a
commercial light sensor that replicates the function of the cones in the
retina (the main physical receptor in bright light conditions), trans-
ducing different light intensities to speciﬁc receptor potentials that
serve as the input to the spiking neuron, which thus emulates the main
mechanism of afferent neurons (sensory coding). Each input generates
a train of voltage spikes with a characteristic frequency ranging from
0.09 Hz to 0.25 Hz depending on the light intensity, corresponding to
a maximum 137% modulation (Supplementary Discussion 1 and 2).
Although afferent neurons are fundamental for sensory coding,
they represent only a small proportion of neurons in the human body,
while interneurons represent 99% of the total9. Besides being respon-
sible for transmitting the signal between different areas of the brain,
their crucial task is to locally modulate the spiking pattern (spike-rate
coding) through different neuromodulators at chemical synapses, in a
process called neuromodulation which enables the essential functions
of learning and decision-making36. Our neuromorphic system is
designed to mimic the neuromodulation process of an interneuron
using the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) as
biological cues. Dopamine (DA) is a well-known neuromodulator
essential for motor regulation functions, rewards, and addiction37
while serotonin is involved in controlling mood, perception, memory
and attention38. In addition, recent studies have addressed the invol-
vement of dopamine in information processing, neurogenesis and
diurnal patterns showing how this neurotransmitter inﬂuences sensory
coding systems39. We replicate the connection between an interneuron
and a neighbouring neuron using an organic neuromorphic device
within a synaptic modulator circuit (biohybrid synapse, see Fig. 1b, d).
This device adopts a conﬁguration similar to an organic electro-
chemical transistor (OECT), as previously reported (see Supplemen-
tary Discussion 3), and its conductance can be modulated in a volatile
way upon ion injection by voltage spikes at the gate. When an electro-
active neurotransmitter, such as dopamine or serotonin, is present in
the electrolyte, the oxidation of these species leads to a non-volatile
conductance modulation (synaptic weight modulation)24,40. This
mechanism and the use of a ﬂuidic module (Supplementary Discus-
sion 3) replicate the phasic release of neurotransmitters (in the mid-
brain and retina), which is assumed to be associated to the biological
functions of signal processing leading to learning and memory41. Signal
computing at the synaptic level depends on the ﬂuctuation of neuro-
transmitters concentration in the mM range at the synaptic cleft (the
pre- to post-synaptic 4 μm space), as these are released upon pre-
synaptic ﬁring (Supplementary Discussion 3 and 5). Hence, as an input
to the synaptic modulator, we connected a spiking neuron which

(VoxDA = 0.3 V), a non-volatile conductance change is induced which
causes the output of the synaptic modulator to increase (Fig. 1d).
Hence, the synaptic modulator represents the weight of the biohybrid
synaptic connection. The next spiking neuron in our hybrid pathway,
the DA-interneuron, receives this variable output voltage which
directly affects the spike frequency (Fig. 1d). Note that the output of
the synaptic modulator shows spikes (dotted lines Fig. 1d) which are
the result of the spiking input signal. However, only the baseline vol-
tage (solid lines in Fig. 1d) represents the synaptic weight and has an
impact on the spike frequency (output) of the connected DA neuron
(Fig. 1d and Supplementary Discussion 4). Figure 1d shows the

modulation of the interneuron spike frequency for two different
concentrations of dopamine, 0.025 mM (light red) and 0.1 mM (dark
red), which simulate the instantaneous concentrations of neuro-
transmitters at the synapse during ﬁring, while the afferent neuron is
spiking during illumination. The introduction of dopamine to the
system (black arrow) leads to a gradual increase of the synaptic
modulator output from 0.32 to 0.38 V, and consequently an increase in
the spike frequency of the neuron (+26% and +28% for 0.025 mM and
0.1 mM DA, respectively). These modulations depend on the con-
centration of the neurotransmitter in the interneuron biohybrid
synapse, similar to the to the biological mechanism of synaptic
plasticity42 as well as on the level of illumination (afferent neuron spike
frequency) (see Supplementary Discussion 4). Due to its modular
elements, speciﬁcally the spiking circuit and synaptic modulator, our
neuromorphic system is able to replicate the main functions of both
afferent neurons and interneurons, which are responsible for sensory
coding and spike-rate coding through neuromodulation, respectively.
However, in biological systems the processing of signals requires a
large collective set of computing elements (neurons and synapses).
Neural pathway between dopaminergic and serotonergic
neurons
In the brain, every single neuron computes the spikes received from
many interneuron connections and ﬁres a spiking output if the sum of
the input stimuli has reached a speciﬁc threshold9. Neural pathways,
the connections formed by an axon and its synapse, link neurons from
different locations and enable the transmission of signals from one
region of the nervous system to another43. The modularity of our
neuromorphic system allows to mimic the circuitry of the nervous
system and design cascading circuits which closely resemble the bio-
logical connections within a neural pathway.
We replicate an interdependent neural connection between two
interneurons, where a spiking signal is transferred or inhibited by the
sending neuron whose spiking activity, in turn, triggers the spiking of
the next interneuron (receiving neuron) in the biological circuit44. The
ﬁrst interneuron is regulated by a synapse expressing DA and com-
putes and transmit the signal through a 5-HT synapse to the second
neuron (see Fig. 2a). Dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons are often
interwoven through interneuron connections even if located in dif-
ferent brain areas44,45.
In this demonstration, the input signal to the neural pathway (pre-
synaptic signal) consists of periodic voltage spikes generated by cus-
tomized software to represent the spikes generated by a generic
(afferent) neuron. Here we prove that the connected organic neurons
and their synapses are able to replicate the biological dependency
where the spiking activity of the receiving (serotonergic) neuron
depends on the activity of sending (dopaminergic) neurons46.
Essentially, the neurotransmitters act as a trigger to overcome the
threshold that activates the ﬁring characteristics of neurons, thus
forming an artiﬁcial neural pathway with the connected spiking neu-
rons and synapses.
The DA and 5-HT regulated spiking neurons are connected
through their synapse with the synaptic modulators (Supplementary
Discussion 3, 4 and 5) (Fig. 1b). Both synapse-spiking circuits (DA-
neuron and 5-HT-neuron) follow the same dynamics which allows the
exchange of the sending and receiving neuron position in the cascade
circuit, further highlighting the modularity and reconﬁgurability of the
system. In the experiments of Fig. 2, the DA-neuron receives the pre-
synaptic input voltage and the signal propagation along the neural
pathway(visualized in Fig. 2a) ismonitored in Fig. 2b. The output of the
synaptic modulator and the output of the spiking circuit are shown in
in Fig. 2b, of both DA (red) and 5-HT (blue) neurons.
At the start of the experiment (0–40 s), the DA-neuron does not
generate any spikes and behaves as a silent neuron since the output of
the synaptic modulator (VSynmod = 0.1 V) is below the threshold voltage
(Vthreshold = 0.2 V, Supplementary Discussion 1, Supplementary Dis-
cussion 1, Supplementary Figs. 7 and 15). After 40 s DA is introduced to
the system and the output of the synaptic modulator increases from
0.12 V to 0.2 V (see red line Fig. 2b). In this case, the neural pathway
excitatory functions are enabled due to the oxidation of DA (see
Supplementary Discussion 3). As a result, the synaptic modulator
output increases exceeding the threshold voltage of the neuron and
activates its ﬁring (see red line of the neuron output Fig. 2b). At this
point, 5-HT is absent, and the last (serotonergic) neuron of the pathway
shifts from the silent to the failed activation state where only transient
spikes are recorded (neuron output grey lines Fig. 2b). However, when
5-HT is introduced (blue lines Fig. 2b), the output of the synaptic
modulator of this last neuron increases from 0.15 to 0.2 V (blue line
Fig. 2b) and, similar to the dopaminergic neuron, the spiking threshold
is overcome (blue line Fig. 2b). On the other hand, when there is no DA
present in the system (and thus the ﬁrst neuron is silent), the second
serotonergic neuron remains silent too even when 5-HT is present
(black line Fig. 2b). These mechanisms emulate the biological scenario
where a DA neuron inhibits the activity of the 5-HT synapse. The
experiment shows that the conductance modulation of the second
synapse, mediated by 5-HT, is strictly controlled by the modulation of
the DA-mediated synapse and so by the spiking behaviour of its neu-
ron. Hence, the biology inspired transition from signal inhibition to
transmission (non-spiking to spiking) of interdependent dopamine
and serotonin interneurons is fully regulated by the presence of neu-
rotransmitters. Using our modular neuromorphic system, we thus
demonstrate a neurotransmitter-mediated pathway primitive for che-
mically activated and modulated spiking neural networks.
Retina inspired sensory coding and neuromodulation
When considering the retina as a model for a biological system, light
and neurotransmitters represent the external and internal stimuli that
not only (Fig. 2) trigger and control signal transmission along a (cas-
cading) neural pathway (activating speciﬁc brain regions), but also
modulate the spike frequency of persistently active neurons. In the
central nervous, the modulation of active neurons represents the
biological mechanisms of external signal processing involving a cas-
cade interaction of sensory coding and spike-rate encoding that
enables learning and memory. To demonstrate this concept, we fur-
ther combine both neuronal functionalities (sensory coding and neu-
romodulation) in our organic neuromorphic pathway, demonstrating

synapse using PEDOT:PSS, is employed. c Sensory coding of light using an ambient

light condition. d Neuromodulation regulated by dopamine using the synaptic

spiking input. The solid lines emphasise the synaptic weight modulation. The spike
frequency modulations are 28% and 26% for 0.1 mM DA (dark red) and 0.025 mM
DA (light red), respectively, with respect to the spike frequency of PBS
(black; 0.10 Hz).

an
intimate
interaction
between
light
spike-coding
and
neurotransmitter-mediated spike frequency modulations. As shown in
Fig. 1c, the light intensity can be encoded in the neuron spike fre-
quency so it can be sent to higher order computing units (e.g., through
the optic nerve to the central nervous system). The power of the retina
resides in its in-sensor functions, performed by the close-interaction of
bipolar cells and amacrine cells. This allows the signal reaching the
inner retina to be highly pre-processed, reducing the power con-
sumption and increasing computing performance47. Some crucial
steps in the pre-processing of visual information such as shape
recognition and light adjustment mechanisms, only occur through the
local action of neuromodulators, including dopamine9. The synthesis
and activity of this neurotransmitter in dopaminergic amacrine cells
(acting as interneurons), is controlled by the level of retina
illumination48. Hence, this interneuron modulates the signal coming
from the afferent neurons. This signal can then be transmitted further
to interneurons that are mediated by other neurotransmitters such as
serotonin. To mimic this biological circuitry in our artiﬁcial retina
prototype, we connected multiple neurons (spiking circuits) and their
synapses (synaptic modulators) in cascade (Fig. 3a). The light-induced
spike pattern of an afferent neuron is sent to the DA regulated synapse
that modulates the synaptic plasticity and controls the activity of its
neuron. Thereafter the signal travels further to the next serotonergic
neuron, connected through its synapse, whose spike frequency is
modulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin.
In Fig. 3b, we expose the light sensor to two light conditions (low
and high intensity) that each result in a speciﬁc receptor potential that
triggers a spike train with a certain frequency (Fig. 1c, see also

Supplementary Discussion 5). We use both these spike patterns as an
input to the ﬁrst dopaminergic neuron (see Fig. 3b), inducing a per-
manent modulation of the chemical synapse through the neuromo-
dulation mechanism (Fig. 1d) in the case that the neurotransmitter was
present (see Fig. 3b). These different spikes patterns affect the max-
imum synaptic modulator output variations (Supplementary Discus-
sion 5). In the condition with high light intensity, the expression of DA
at the ﬁrst synapse leads to a 0.08 mV synaptic modulation (Fig. 3b),
which results in a 29% increase of the spike frequency of the DA neuron
(Fig. 3b). On the other hand, the low light intensity condition causes a
0.04 mV synaptic modulation and a corresponding spike frequency
increase of 12%. Note that, similar to Fig. 1d, the output of the synaptic
modulator shows spikes resulting from its input signal but only the
baseline voltage determines the spike frequency of the output signal of
the corresponding neuron. The signal from the spiking neuron when
DA is present, is transmitted to the next serotonergic neuron. Here, the
release of 5-HT causes a synaptic modulation of 0.05 mV (Fig. 3b)
corresponding to a spike frequency increase of 20% (Fig. 3b) for a high
light intensity while the low ambient light intensity leads to a 5-HT-
mediated modulation of 0.035 mV and a spike frequency increase
of 11%.
This neuromorphic cascading pathway enables the transduction
of ambient light intensities to a voltage potential and subsequently to a
precise spike pattern which translates to speciﬁc neurotransmitter-
mediated synaptic modulations. As such, the biohybrid synapse of the
DA synaptic modulator stores the information, received in the form of
spikes, as a synaptic weight change (conductance modulation) and
generates a corresponding spike pattern that elicits a cascade
mechanism on the 5-HT neuron: a key to replicate the biological sco-
topic regulation mediated by retinal neurotransmitters.
More sophisticated, optical sensors including light wavelength
selectivity49 and multiplexing capabilities50 can be implemented to
further improve the performance of our system by integrating addi-
tional biology-inspired functions such as light-wavelength sensitivity
(colour -photopic vision of cones) and the summation of stimuli from
sensors working at different light intensities (rods and cones mesopic
vision), respectively.
Discussion
The modular chemically-adaptive neuromorphic system presented in
this work demonstrates an integrated approach to build tailored bio-
hybrid pre-processing units for programmable and cascadable neural
pathways. We illustrate a strategy which leverages the Hebbian learn-
ing functions of neuromorphic devices to develop a modular and
reconﬁgurable circuit displaying synaptic conditioning based on bio-
chemical signalling activity (dopamine and serotonin) and light sti-
muli, by integrating light sensors, spiking circuits and synaptic
modulators. This modularity allows for straightforward design of sys-
tems that can selectively trigger spike-encoded signal transmission,
while locally transducing and computing both physical as well as
physiological environment information: an essential step towards
realizing complex neuromorphic hardware at the biohybrid interface.
As such, this neuromorphic platform replicates the interrelated bio-
logical functions that are not only exploited to demonstrate loose and
decoupled biomimetic concepts but to establish a primitive version of
an artiﬁcial neuromorphic computing circuit.
We highlight that the modular elements enable an unprecedent
interdependency of biological functions (sensory coding and neuro-
modulation) thus resembling the performance of biological pathways.
Our circuit represents a prototype for more complex systems that can
be designed to introduce Hebbian learning functions (based on the
neuromodulatory activity of the biohybrid synapses), and, depending
on frequency-selective rules, multi-sensory stimuli processing and
integration based on the afferent neurons functions. We envision
integrating algorithms for retina-speciﬁc computational functions to
realise adaptive biohybrid computing pathways.
These neuromorphic pathways aim to replace damaged biological
ﬁrst order processing units (such as the one constituted by photo-
receptors, bipolar and amacrine cells), thereby restoring the signal
transmission to higher order units within the central nervous system.

Methods
Integrated neuromorphic circuit fabrication
Ti (5 nm)/Au(100 nm) electrodes were patterned on glass slide sub-
strates by a bottom down approach. First the metals were deposited on
glass via thermal evaporation, then the surface was cleaned through
plasma cleaning and covered with the positive photoresist S1805. The
electrode patterning was performed with the use of the Maskless
Aligner - Heidelberg MLA150. After development the metals were
etched via chemical etching using ﬁrst gold etchant (30 s) and then HCl
(5 h) for removing Ti. After a surface treatment with the adhesion
promoter Silane A-174, a 2.3 μm -thick parylene C was deposited on the
substrate serving as an encapsulation layer. Then, a diluted micro-90
(2% v/v in DI water) was spin-coated as an anti-adhesive layer, and
subsequently, a sacriﬁcial second parylene layer of 2.3 μm was
deposited.
The
electrode
areas
were
opened
through
photo-
lithography (SU-8 3005). The overall circuit design is illustrated in
Supplementary Discussion 1, while the fabrication steps are depicted in
Supplementary Discussion Fig. 2. The electrodes were covered by spin
coating with the different materials avoiding cross-contamination by
placing on the substrate a PDMS well to conﬁne the desired solutions.
The interdigitated microelectrodes used for the four OECTs of the
inverter pair and one for the switch have an electrode width of 10 m
and distance 5 m, and comprises 22 ﬁnger pairs with length 2.2 mm.
The circuit design includes also a capacitor which was disconnected
during the measurements since it did not contribute to the response
time of the circuit, as the capacitances of the other elements (switch
and inverter OECTs) were dominant. The capacitor is constituted by
two areas with dimension 250 × 500 m where PEDOT:PSS solution was
spin-coated.
See
Supplementary Discussion
1 for a
schematic
description of the fabrications steps.
p(C4-T2-C0-EG) devices spin coating
The polymer p(C4-T2-C0-EG) was synthetised by McCulloch group (see
Supplementary Discussion 1)51. The material solutions were prepared
in chloroform at the concentration of 20 mg mL−1. The interdigitated
microelectrodes, and so the whole circuit substrate, were pre-treated
with UV ozone over 15 min. The polymer solutions were spin-coated at
500 rpm for 60 s to fabricate the OECT comprising the inverters of the
spiking circuit.
P-3O devices fabrication
The polymer P-3O was synthetised by Gang Ye following a previously
reported protocol and the material solutions were prepared in
chloroform at the concentration of 5 mg mL−1 35. The interdigitated
microelectrodes were pre-treated with UV ozone over 15 min. The
polymer solutions were spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 30 s.
Biohybrid synapse
The biohybrid synapses were fabricated on glass-ITO patterned sub-
strates purchased from Xin Yan Technology Ltd. The size of the glass
square substrates is 25 mm with patterned squares of ITO (20 ohm
sq−1) of 10 mm covering each corner. Substrates were cleaned through
sonication in IPA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 20 min. Employing Kapton
tape and using a PMMA master mask, 2 stripes connecting opposed
ITO squares (with ﬁxed width 5 mm) were traced for the deposition of
the polymer mixture. PEDOT:PSS (Hereaus, Clevios PH 1000) aqueous
solution was prepared by adding 6 vol.% ethylene glycol (Sigma-
Aldrich, USA) to increase the PEDOT:PSS conductivity, 0.1 vol.%
dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as a surfactant,
and 1 vol.% (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) as a crosslinking agent to improve mechanical stability. PED-
OT:PSS solution was spun on the selected areas of the substrate at
1000 rpm for 2 min and baked at 120 °C for 20 min. Before operation
the devices were conditioned at least 20 min in PBS solution, in order
to avoid swelling effects during electrical measurements.
Neurotransmitters solutions preparation
Neurotransmitter solutions were freshly prepared by dissolving
dopamine hydrochloride (98%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and serotonin
hydrochloride (98%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) into Dulbecco’s Phosphate
Buffered Saline (Modiﬁed, without calcium chloride and magnesium
chloride, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at multiple concentrations ranging from
0.01 mM to 0.1 mM.
Connected Spiking circuits and electrical measurements
Each integrated spiking circuit was connected to AKEO multichannel
using
pogo-pin
clamps as depicted
in
Supplementary
Discus-
sion 4 and 5. For each circuit VDD1 and VDD2 and VIN were applied
through ARKEO channels while simultaneously recording the VOUT. For
the experiment in Fig. 2, the trace of the afferent neuron VOUT was
recorded in a preliminary measurement. After connecting two neurons
operating with DA and 5-HT, the recorded trace was used as VIN to the
hybrid synapse of the DA-neuron using ARKEO multichannel as a vol-
tage source. All the different conﬁguration of the neurons connections
and schematic, including the microﬂuidic setup are described in
Supporting Discussion 4 and 5.
