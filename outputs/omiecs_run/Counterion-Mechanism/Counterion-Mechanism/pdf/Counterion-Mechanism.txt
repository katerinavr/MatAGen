Organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs) have varied
performance requirements across a diverse application space. Chemically
doping the OMIEC can be a simple, low-cost approach for adapting
performance metrics. However, complex challenges, such as identifying new
dopant materials and elucidating design rules, inhibit its realization. Here,
these challenges are approached by introducing a new n-dopant,
tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBA-OH), and identifying a new design
consideration underpinning its success. TBA-OH behaves as both a chemical
n-dopant and morphology additive in donor acceptor co-polymer
naphthodithiophene diimide-based polymer, which serves as an electron
transporting material in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). The
combined eﬀects enhance OECT transconductance, charge carrier mobility,
and volumetric capacitance, representative of the key metrics underpinning
all OMIEC applications. Additionally, when the TBA+ counterion adopts an
“edge-on” location relative to the polymer backbone, Coulombic interaction
between the counterion and polaron is reduced, and polaron delocalization
increases. This is the ﬁrst time such mechanisms are identiﬁed in
doped-OECTs and doped-OMIECs. The work herein therefore takes the ﬁrst
steps toward developing the design guidelines needed to realize chemical
doping as a generic strategy for tailoring performance metrics in OECTs and
OMIECs.

1. Introduction
Organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors
(OMIECs) are a novel and emergent, yet
complex class of organic electronic mate-
rials. OMIECs have unique electronic and
dynamic structural properties, arising from
their ability to couple and simultaneously
transport ionic and electronic charges.
These intrinsic properties are attracting in-
terest for technologies spanning bioelec-
tronics and medical devices,[1,2] neuromor-
phic applications and computing,[3–10,11] as
well as energy storage, biological and chem-
ical sensing,[12] displays, light emission,
and printed circuits.[13] This diverse appli-
cation space is well-suited to organic elec-
tronics: Along with low-cost, large area,
and solution-processible qualities, a key
beneﬁt of organic electronic materials is
their range of chemical structures. In
stark contrast to inorganic semiconductors
and solid conductors, organic electronic
materials oﬀer “make-to-order” electronics
with the electronic and mechanical prop-
erties needed to realize the impressively
broad OMIEC application space. However,
despite this important advantage, to-date

OMIEC research has predominantly focused on a single ma-
terial,
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate
(PEDOT:PSS),[14,15] which is infamous for its unalterable struc-
ture and poor control of ionic and electronic components.[16]
To move beyond PEDOT:PSS and fulﬁll the aforementioned
application space, OMIECs with versatile performance metrics
are needed. By using the organic electrochemical transistor
(OECT) as a tool to benchmark OMIEC parameters,[17] chem-
ical synthesis has been shown to be one successful approach
for modifying OMIEC performance metrics.[18] For example,
single-component, homogenous donor–acceptor copolymers are
making excellent progress,[19–21] including working in operat-
ing regimes beyond PEDOT:PSS depletion mode, such as accu-
mulation mode operation for low power applications, and with
both electron transporting and ambipolar characteristics for logic
circuits.[21–23] Another approach is to use materials or device engi-
neering strategies.[24] For example, the following have been iden-
tiﬁed for altering OMIEC operation/performance as measured
in OECTs: blending materials,[25,26] solvent engineering,[27] in-
terface modiﬁcation,[28–30] and more recently, doping of the bulk
active layer during the fabrication steps.[31] The latter chemical
or molecular doping is of interest for a number of reasons: i)
Doping has been critical to the success of silicon electronics and
is widely used for traditional organic semiconductors and their
devices.[32,33] ii) The simplicity of the technique, i.e., admixing
a dopant solution with a host polymer solution, is scalable and
ﬁts within the low-cost, solution-processed framework of organic
electronics. iii) Preliminary ﬁndings show molecular doping im-
proves OECT transconductance (gm), charge carrier mobility (μ)
and volumetric capacitance (C*),[31] suggesting chemical doping
has the potential to inﬂuence key ﬁgures of merit underpinning
a variety of OMIEC applications.[13]
If doping has the potential to impact OMIEC-based electronics
in the same way doping revolutionized silicon technologies, how
can it be realized as a generic strategy for OECTs and OMIECs?
Key reasons that doping is unexploited in OMIECs include a lack
of identiﬁed dopants that operate in air and water, and lack of
design guidelines. Here, we use electron transporting OECTs
to approach these challenges. We ﬁnd the Brønsted-base, tetra-
butylammonium hydroxide (TBA-OH), successfully operates as
both a morphology-changing additive and a chemical n-dopant,
to enhance key performance metrics in donor–acceptor copoly-
mer naphthodithiophene diimide (pNDTI-TT) OECTs. In terms
of morphology-changing additive, we ﬁnd the presence of TBA-
OH may contribute to preserving structural integrity in organic
layers that have been exposed to electrolyte. In terms of a chem-
ical n-doping, the OH−behaves as an anion transfer/exchange
n-dopant and improves gm, C*, and μ. Finally, we identify a pre-
ferred “edge-on” location for the TBA+ counterion that reduces its
Coulombic interaction with the polaron, to enhance the polaron
delocalization. Overall, a new chemical dopant and new design
rule are identiﬁed for doped-OECTs and doped-OMIECs.

2.1. A New Chemical n-dopant for Organic Electrochemical
Transistors and Organic Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors
We opted to identify a new chemical n-dopant, because n-
type OMIECs typically have lower performance than p-type
OMIECs,[21] and balanced performance is important for comple-
mentary technologies.[34] Direct charge transfer n-dopants have
high lying highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), i.e., low
ionization energies, to donate electrons to the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) of the host.[32–35] This makes direct
charge transfer n-dopants reactive in oxygen and air and, in gen-
eral, makes it extremely challenging to identify stable n-dopants
for organic semiconductors. For OECTs, it is more challenging
because OECTs should demonstrate operation in aqueous elec-
trolytes, for their intended use in bioelectronic systems. Addi-
tionally, OMIEC LUMOs are often shallow (≈−4 eV), to avoid
reduction reactions in water.[36] One option to bypass this in-
stability is to use a charge-transfer salt/dopant salt.[37–40] Anion-
induced doping mechanisms have successfully demonstrated
stable n-doping in polymers operating in ambient, aqueous envi-
ronments; speciﬁcally, tetra-n-butylammonium ﬂuoride (TBAF)
was found to behave as an n-dopant in naphthalene diimide
(NDI)-based OMIECs.[31] We therefore identiﬁed a material that
was likely to undergo similar anion mechanisms. We selected
the OH-anion in the Brønsted-base TBA-OH (Figure 1a), because
Kim et al. showed that it will undergo/initiate anion-induced n-
doping mechanisms in NDI-based organic thin-ﬁlm transistors
(OTFTs).[40] TBA-OH is also an attractive option because it is
low-cost and commercially available. Next, we chose a compati-
ble host for the TBA-OH. The host organic layer is an important
consideration for doped-organic semiconductors (OSCs) because
the diverse chemical structures have made doping harder to real-
ize generally, compared to inorganics, in addition to poor organic
doping eﬃciencies, doping technique variation, and morphology
changes.[41–44] Based on the aforementioned success of TBA-OH
in NDI-based OTFTs,[40] we chose a recently developed, n-type
donor–acceptor copolymer, with a thiophene-annulated deriva-
tive of NDI as the acceptor unit, naphthodithiophene diimide
(pNDTI-TT) (Figure 1b),[45] as the host OMIEC. We note that both
materials are highly soluble, and therefore suited to the simple,
cost-eﬀective solution-doping technique that will be used in this
work.[40]
OECTs were then used to explore the systematic impact
of TBA-OH in pNDTI-TT at diﬀerent doping concentrations
(Figure 1c–g). The importance of this experiment is several
fold: i) Transistors are exceptional tools for exploring funda-
mental eﬀects of doping on charge transport, as well as iden-
tifying new dopant materials;[43] ii) OECTs are used to bench-
mark OMIEC performance metrics,[17] iii) OECTs are popu-
lar, practical devices, identiﬁed as fundamental building blocks
for advanced electronics, body–machine interfaces, drug deliv-
ery, smart textiles, bioelectronics, adaptive healthcare, and neu-
romorphic computing;[16,46–49] iv) doping beneﬁts transistors,
as is evident from traditional ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors, by ﬁlling
traps, enabling threshold voltage control, minimizing contact
resistance, increasing measured mobility, and improving bias
stress stability.[33,41,44] Two solutions containing TBA-OH and

transconductance (gm), with systematically varied quantities of TBA-OH, taken over six devices each. VT has been extracted from the relationship between
√ID and VG. The shift in VT and gradual improvement in gm and IOFF—that worsen again at very high dopant concentrations—indicate that TBA-OH
successfully n-dopes the pNDTI-TT. Although the key performance metrics are improved in the best-performing 400 mol% system, (e)–(g) show a large
deviation in the 400 mol% data set. The latter highlights an important point about device uniformity challenges with disordered, solution-processed
polymers, and more so for OECT active layers transporting ions and swelling when exposed to electrolyte. Figure S3 in the Supporting Information
conﬁrms the impact of the dopant at 400 mol%: we fabricated an additional six OECTs, on diﬀerent days and with pNDTI-TT synthesized in a diﬀerent
batch, to compare the pristine pNDTI-TT with the best-performing pNDTI-TT:TBA-OH (400 mol%).
pNDTI-TT, dissolved in methanol (as purchased) and chloro-
form, respectively, were admixed, at varying concentrations of
TBA-OH to the total molar mass of the pNDTI-TT: 0, 20, 40,
400 molar percentage (mol%). A further highly doped solution at
1:1 solution volume ratio was included to conﬁrm/explore dop-
ing trends on transistor performance.[50] The TBA-OH concen-
trations were chosen to give a broad overview of the impact TBA-
OH has on OECT device performance, as well as to identify the
optimum dopant concentration. To normalize any possible ag-
gregation eﬀects arising from the minor solvent blend, exactly
the same quantities of methanol and chloroform were used in
each solution, regardless of the TBA-OH concentration.[41,42,50–54]
The solutions were left overnight in a nitrogen-ﬁlled glovebox
and spin-coated into OECT structures with 600 and 30 μm chan-
nel lengths and widths, respectively. The ﬁlm thicknesses were
measured in the OECT channels using either atomic force mi-
croscopy (AFM) or a Dektak proﬁlometer. 1 m NaCl(aq.) was used
as an electrolyte with Ag/AgCl gate electrodes. For each system,
at least six OECTs were fabricated and tested, to give statisti-
cal trends that account for the natural variation in OECT de-
vice uniformity. Figure 1c–g and Figures S1 and S2 in the Sup-
porting Information show the systematic trend TBA-OH has on
pNDTI-TT OECTs. The trends shown are a textbook represen-
tation of doped transistors: The threshold voltage (VT) shifts to-
ward zero at the best-performing concentration (400 mol%) and
increases again at 1:1; the oﬀ-current (IOFF) gradually increases
and is highly pronounced at 1:1; and the on-current (ION) grad-
ually increases before decreasing again at 1:1. Above the best-
performing 400 mol%, there are likely adverse scattering eﬀects
between charge carriers and dopant molecules, as well as disrup-
tion to the morphological structure that explains the reduction
in performance at 1:1. Importantly, we ﬁnd that TBA-OH indeed
impacts gm (Figure 1g and Figure S1a, Supporting Information),
μ (Figure S1b, Supporting Information), and C* (Figure S1d,e,
Supporting Information).
Although key performance metrics are improved in the best-
performing 400 mol% system, there is a large deviation in the 400
mol% data set (Figure 1e–g). The latter highlights the importance
of device uniformity in disordered, solution-processed polymers,
and even more so for OECT active layers transporting ions and
swelling in electrolyte. To verify the impact of the TBA-OH at 400
mol%, we fabricated an additional six OECTs, with a newly syn-
thesized batch of pNDTI-TT, comparing pristine pNDTI-TT with
the best-performing pNDTI-TT:TBA-OH (400 mol%). Figure S3

in the Supporting Information and Table 1 show the addition
of TBA-OH improves OECT gm by up to 9×, from 4.8 μS to a
maximum 43.1 μS, when compared to the pristine system. Fur-
thermore, μ increases from 9.8 ×10−4 to 3.4 ×10−3, C* increases
from 151.3 to 589.8 F cm−3, and the μC* product extracted from
the OECTs increases by >13×, from 0.15 to 2.0 F cm−1 V−1 s−1.
The increase in μ may occur because the TBA-OH donates addi-
tional charge carriers to the pNDTI-TT. On the one hand, these
additional carriers act to ﬁll trap states (evidence for this is that
VT shifts with the addition of dopant). On the other hand, addi-
tional carriers impact bulk charges on the polymer ﬁlm, which
in turn draws in additional ions.[31] C* may be improved be-
cause the TBA-OH increases charge carrier density and hence
capacitance; additionally, we see a gradual reduction in the thin-
ﬁlm thickness with increasing TBA-OH concentrations,[42,54]
from 65.5 nm in the pristine system to 30.1 nm in pNDTI-
TT:TBA-OH (400 mol%) (Table S1, Supporting Information).
C* is therefore likely increased because of these combined ef-
fects. Table 2 compares normalized gm for the best-performing
pNDTI-TT:TBA-OH (400 mol%) to other n-type systems in the
literature. We ﬁnd that the best-performing pNDTI-TT:TBA-OH
(400 mol%) OECTs have the third highest transconductance for
all n-type OECTs reported to-date. Overall, this highlights the
remarkable eﬀectiveness of the TBA-OH for signiﬁcantly en-
hancing key performance metrics,[13] via a simple processing
technique.
To conﬁrm that n-doping is indeed occurring with the addi-
tion of TBA-OH, we used ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy
(UPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.
UPS was used to identify TBA-OH as an n-dopant for OTFTs
by Kim et al., who measured a Fermi level shift toward the
conduction band,[40] while EPR has been used to detect Lewis
acid doping in semiconductors.[31,42,54,61–64] The UPS results are
shown in Figure 2a and Figure S4a in the Supporting Informa-
tion. The work function decreases from 4.4 eV in the pristine (0
mol%) system to 4.1 eV for the best-performing (400 mol%) TBA-
OH:NDTI system (Figure 2a), which is a characteristic behavior
of n-type doping.[65] Considering that the band gap of pNDTI-TT
is 1.30 eV,[45] a 0.3 eV shift in the work function and a 0.1 eV shift
in the HOMO onset away from the Fermi energy (Figure S4a,
Supporting Information) provide strong evidence that pNDTI-TT
is n-doped by TBA-OH. The EPR results provide further evidence
that pNDTI-TT is n-doped by TBA-OH. Here, Figure 2b shows a
pronounced increase in the EPR signal indicating that TBA-OH
generates unpaired electrons in pNDTI-TT.[42] We attribute this
phenomena to the OH−anion, as supported by studies showing
how anion/cations can transfer from Lewis acids, Lewis bases,
and Brønsted-bases to behave as p- or n-dopants in various or-
ganic semiconductor families.[40,66–69] Indeed, n-doping can in-
crease the measured μ closer to that of the intrinsic material
μ, and increase the number of charge carriers for charge stor-
age/C*, which in turn improve the μC* product and therefore
gm. In the case of TBA-OH:NDTI, the OH−anion transfers from
the TBA-OH and produces a hydroxide-polymer segment, which
in turn releases an electron to a hydroxide-free polymer seg-
ment, and by doing so acts as an n-dopant.[31,40,66–69] We therefore

(6)
and the pNDTI-TT-hydroxide is assumed to be decomposed.[70]
2.2. Chemical Dopants Behave as Morphology Directing
Additives
Another potentially lucrative, yet complex, feature of doped or-
ganic systems is that the dopant may simultaneously behave as
a morphology directing additive. Dopant-directed morphology
modiﬁcations in other chemically doped organic systems have
been found to be beneﬁcial for charge transport.[42,54] In the case
of OECTs, the performance may also be enhanced if the dopant-
directed morphology modiﬁcation enables more balanced ionic
and electronic charge transport.[71] Therefore, to explore the im-
pact of TBA-OH on morphology in the pNDTI-TT thin ﬁlms, we
used grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS)
and AFM, to compare pristine pNDTI-TT to the best-performing
pNDTI-TT:TBA-OH (400 mol%). To account for any subsequent
changes in morphology that occur because of swelling, we also
compared the pristine and 400 mol% systems after they had been
exposed to the 0.1 m NaCl electrolyte. The exposed ﬁlms may be
better representative of the morphology during OECT operation,
when compared to the dry ﬁlms. Figure 3 and Figures S5 and S6
in the Supporting Information show the GIWAXS results. We
ﬁnd both pristine and best-performing doped microstructures
are similar before they are exposed to electrolyte, with 𝜋–𝜋stack-
ing of pNDTI-TT (d = 0.35 nm) occurring primarily in the out-of-
plane direction, and lamellar stacking (d = 2.8 nm) of pNDTI-TT
in the in-plane direction. After the ﬁlms are exposed to electrolyte,
the pristine system has structure features and in-plane peaks at
d = 0.82 and 0.41 nm (ﬁrst and second ordering, respectively)
perpendicular to the lamellar backbones (Figure S6c, Support-
ing Information). The presence of these subtle features suggest
there is higher crystallinity in the pristine system after exposure
to electrolyte, when compared to the best-performing pNDTI-
TT:TBA-OH (400 mol%). In both pristine and pNDTI-TT:TBA-
OH (400 mol%), the orientation becomes more isotropic after
exposure to electrolyte, and the dominant lamellar stacking di-
rection shifts from favoring in-plane stacking to slightly favoring
out-of-plane stacking. The d-spacing of the 𝜋–𝜋stacking remains
the same as the system that has not been exposed to electrolyte.
After electrolyte exposure, the pristine 0 mol% system out-of-
plane lamellar spacing increases from 2.6 to 4.6 nm, whereas
the pNDTI-TT:TBA-OH (400 mol%) maintains a d-spacing of
2.6 nm—about half the lattice of the pristine system. The pristine
system also shows higher crystallinity with more ordering in the
lamellar packing, and new in-plane structural features (d = 0.82
and 0.41 nm, in Figure S6c, Supporting Information), whereas
the pNDTI-TT:TBA-OH (400 mol%) has no in-plane features.
The lack of in-plane features for the latter has previously been
associated with high planarity and no preferential cofacial align-
ment, which enables strong intermolecular 𝜋–𝜋interactions with
tighter d-spacing.[45]
The GIWAXS indicates a major backbone orientation change
after exposure to electrolyte, in systems with and without TBA-
OH, with the lamellar spacing in the TBA-OH-doped polymer
half that of the pristine polymer. AFM imaging in Figure S7
(Supporting Information), along with respective root mean
square (RMS) data in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), fur-
ther supports TBA-OH changing the pNDTI-TT morphology,
and conﬁrming its role as a morphology additive. Figure S8 and
Table S1 in the Supporting Information show that the presence

of TBA-OH in pNDTI-TT results in a decrease in overall ﬁlm
thickness, and increase in surface roughness, indicating that dop-
ing has a strong impact on the OMIEC layer and may cause the
morphology to be denser and more aggregated. Dopant-directed
morphology modiﬁcations may be beneﬁcial because they enable
ions to infuse more easily into the polymer ﬁlm, resulting in eﬃ-
cient/eﬀective electrochemical doping.[66] However, we note that
disentangling the precise mechanism behind dopants as mor-
phology additives, i.e., convoluted dopant–structure–property re-
lationships, is extremely challenging. The complexity of this topic
is well-documented for organic semiconductors,[42,54,73–75] and
is more challenging in OMIECs, where electrolyte solvent and
ions are present during device operation.[76,77] Figure S9 in the
Supporting Information veriﬁes that the dopant-directed mor-
phology modiﬁcations do not have a signiﬁcant impact on the
pNDTI:TBA-OH (400 mol%) OECT operational stability. After
applying a constant voltage (VG = VD = 0.4 V) for 2650 s, the
pNDTI:TBA-OH (400 mol%) maintains a high current (≈2.4 μA)
as compared to the pristine system (≈0.48 μA). The overall re-
duction in ID is similar for both systems, with ID reducing by
7.0% for the pristine polymer, compared to 7.6% in pNDTI:TBA-
OH (400 mol%). We note that this system has excellent potential
for further optimization in terms of stability and performance.
The 400 mol% identiﬁed as the best-performing system here is
dependent on host polymer, processing parameters, and solvent,
where solvent choice can impact doping eﬃciency.[42,54] Addition-
ally, the relatively high, best-performing doping concentration is
attributed to the solution-doping technique used in this work that
was chosen for its simplicity.[73,78]
2.3. Identifying a New Counterion Mechanism for Doped
Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Doped Organic Mixed
Ionic-Electronic Conductors
So far, the GIWAXS and AFM data indicate TBA-OH preferen-
tially alters morphology, while the combined OECT, UPS, and
EPR data provides strong evidence that TBA-OH is an excellent
n-dopant for the pNDTI-TT OMIEC. However, the question aris-
ing from the aforementioned reaction mechanism is: what hap-
pens to the TBA+ counterion? Although unexplored in doped
OECTs or OMIECs, the counterion created after chemical dop-
ing in low dielectric constant organic semiconductors is known
to impact electronic properties.[38,39,79–83] We therefore used den-
sity functional theory (DFT) to further investigate the role of
the TBA+ counterion, with the aim of establishing whether this
should be considered as a design guideline/criterion for doped-
OECTs and doped-OMIECs going forward. Figure 4 summarizes
the results from the DFT calculations on single oligomers. We
ﬁnd that the polaron charge distribution in pNDTI-TT is sub-
stantially narrower with the TBA+ counterion, compared to with-
out, where the full-widths at half-maximum are 9 and 12 back-
bone double bonds, respectively. The polaron localization, in the
presence of the counterion, is caused by the Coulomb interaction

Figure 4. Characteristics of doped pNDTI-TT oligomer obtained by DFT calculations: a) chain geometry of neutral state P, reduced state without coun-
terion P−, and reduced state with counterion [TBA+-P−]; b) polaron charge distribution for P−and [TBA+-P−]; c) optical absorption spectrum for P,
P−, and [TBA+-P−], the position of the polaron peak shown by the arrow reﬂects how strongly bound the polaron is; d) “edge” and “face” locations of
TBA+ counterion relative to pNDTI-TT oligomer (chains truncated for clarity); the associated polaron charge distributions are shown in (e) and optical
absorption spectra in (f). We note that, although there is no substantial, visible diﬀerence in the polaron delocalization, the shape of the polaron charge
distribution is noticeably diﬀerent, as inﬂuenced by the position of the counterion relative to the pNDTI-TT unit where the polaron is centered, as shown
in (e).
between the polaron and the counterion, which yields a more
stable/bound polaron. This is shown by the large blue shift in
the main sub-gap polaron feature in the optical absorption spec-
trum, of a reduced chain with and without a counterion presence
(Figure 4c), where the polaron peak shifts by ≈1.2 eV when the
counterion is present. Indeed, more bound polarons are more
localized and their energy levels are more shifted compared to
the frontier orbitals.[84] Optical transitions involving the pola-
ronic states and the frontier orbitals can be observed by UV-vis-IR
spectroscopy,[85] and the excitation energies associated with these
transitions reﬂect the stability of the polaron. Interestingly, the
DFT analysis also shows the position of the TBA+ relative to the
polymer chain impacts the polaron characteristics: Polarons are
less bound if the TBA+ is located at the edge of the conjugated
backbone (“edge-on” location), compared to the face of the back-
bone (“face-on” location), as supported by the substantial red shift
(up to 0.25 eV) in the optical absorption spectrum (Figure 4f).
This is rationalized by the longer counterion–polaron distance as-
sociated with the edge-on location, which reduces the Coulomb
interaction responsible for stabilizing the polaron. Given that
lamellar spacing and 𝜋-stacking can keep the counterion fur-
ther away from the polymer backbone, where the polaron is lo-
cated, the Coulombic interactions between polarons and counte-
rions are reduced in systems with more pronounced crystalline
features.[81,86] The latter eﬀect is important for achieving high
mobilities.[82,81] In this case, the GIWAXS indicates that pNDTI-
TT containing TBA-OH has closer d-spacing as compared to pris-
tine pNDTI-TT. This may result from the TBA+ being interca-
lated between lamella stacks in the preferential edge-on location,
which in turn may reduce the polymer swelling when exposed
to electrolyte. Furthermore, TBA+ is a large counterion and may
preferentially adopt the edge-on position with its center of mass
further away, thereby reducing interactions with polarons. This
preferential edge-on counterion position has not been reported
before for chemical or molecular dopants in OECTs or OMIECs.
Finally, we tested the general applicability of TBA-OH as an
n-dopant by exploring its impact on OECTs in another host
polymer. We chose naphthalene diimide (pNDI-TT) as a host
(Figure S10a, Supporting Information), based on its likelihood to
undergo the aforementioned reaction mechanism,[40] and tested
OECTs with TBA-OH at 0, 40, 400 mol% and 1:1 volume ra-
tio, to compare with pNDTI-TT. We note that pNDI-TT has
lower intrinsic performance metrics than pristine pNDTI-TT in
OECTs,[45] and this experiment is designed to explore system-
atic changes in OECT or trends, not speciﬁc parameter values.
Figure S10 in the Supporting Information shows the OECTs ex-
hibit certain characteristic symbols of doped transistors: VT shift
toward 0 V with the addition of TBA-OH, ION/OFF improvement,
improvement in device uniformity. Additionally, thin-ﬁlm color
changes at 1:1 (Figure S10b, Supporting Information), indicat-
ing adducts/charge transfer complexes are formed between the
TBA-OH (i.e., the OH−) and pNDI-TT.[54,62] However, although
performance metrics (gm, C*, and μ) are changed, they are not
enhanced eﬀectively as they were in pNDTI-TT (Figure S1c–h,

Supporting Information). One interesting consideration for the
diﬀerences between these two systems is the rigid pNDTI-TT
framework compared to pNDI-TT. pNDTI-TT is designed to have
enhanced backbone coplanarity that makes it more eﬀective at
preserving crystallite interconnectivity in aqueous electrolytes.
Although the complexity of this is beyond the scope of this cur-
rent study, it is possible that the crystallization retention sup-
ports the counterions adopting the preferential edge-on location
in pNDTI-TT. Backbone structure and glycolated sidechains—
that provide space for the counterions to get too close to the
conjugated backbone—may be further explored as optimizable
variables, for producing successful, eﬀective doped-OECT and
doped-OMIEC systems.
3. Conclusions
Overall, a new chemical n-dopant and design rule are iden-
tiﬁed for n-type OECTs and OMIECs. We ﬁnd that TBA-OH
enhances transconductance, mobility, and volumetric capaci-
tance in pNDTI-TT OECTs, that are representative of key per-
formance metrics underpinning a broad variety of OMIEC
technologies/applications.[13] This is important because OMIECs
need controllable with diverse performance metrics to move be-
yond PEDOT:PSS and realize their broad application space. GI-
WAXS and AFM show TBA-OH behaves as a morphology di-
recting additive and the UPS and EPR show that TBA-OH be-
haves as an n-dopant, with the OH−acting as an anion trans-
fer n-dopant.[40] While the OECT data suggest a synergistic com-
bination of n-doping and morphology modiﬁcations improves
key performance metrics, we also show the dopant counterion
(TBA+) location impacts polaron delocalization. Namely, if TBA+
adopts an “edge-on” location relative to the conjugated backbone,
polarons are less bound, compared to when TBA+ cations adopt a
“face-on” location. This phenomenon is rationalized by increased
polaron binding energy arising from the Coulomb interaction
when the distance between the counterion and polaron is small,
which acts to localize the polaron. We suggest the latter is a new
design rule that should be considered as part of the development
of doped-OECT and doped-OMIEC systems. In addition to intro-
ducing a new dopant, this work is the ﬁrst elucidate design rules
for doped-OMIECs to take a step toward realizing doping as a
generic strategy for tailoring performance metrics in OECTs and
OMIECs.
4. Experimental Section
Organic Solution Preparation:
The pNDI-TT and pNDTI-TT polymer
solutions were each prepared at 5 mg mL−1 concentration in chloroform.
The TBA-OH solution was purchased from Sigma Aldrich in methanol at
1 m concentration. The TBA-OH was added to the polymer so that the TBA-
OH was present in the polymer solutions at molar percentage concentra-
tions of 20, 40, and 400 mol%. Exactly the same quantity of methanol was
present in each polymer solution (including the 0 mol% solution), regard-
less of dopant concentration, to account for any residual solvent-blending
eﬀects from using chloroform with a small quantity of methanol. Solvent-
blend eﬀects are beyond the scope of this study. Additionally, a high doping
concentration (1:1 volume ratio) was used to investigate trends in OECT
performance with dopant concentration. After mixing and prior to deposi-
tion, the solutions were left overnight in a nitrogen-ﬁlled glovebox.
Organic
Electrochemical
Transistor
Fabrication:
Top-gate
bottom-
contact transistors were fabricated by patterning 10 nm metal Cr
adhesion layer followed by 100 nm Au conduction layer on clean Boroﬂoat
glass slides, using thermal evaporation, to serve as the source and drain
electrodes with channel dimensions 600 μm width and 30 μm length. The
electrode patterned substrates were subsequently cleaned in an ultrasonic
bath with a Decon-90 soap and deionized water solution, then acetone,
followed by isopropanol alcohol. The top surfaces of the substrates were
activated by UV Ozone followed by O2 plasma to maximize the eﬀects
of the adhesion promotor (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate), prior
to depositing a 2 μm layer of Parylene C on the substrates, using an
SCS Labcoater 2. A 3 vol% microsoap solution was spin coated onto the
Parylene C at 1800 rpm to encourage easy peeling of a second, 4 μm
sacriﬁcial layer of Parylene C, which was used to pattern the polymer in
the channel. The 600 μm width, 30 μm length channels were patterned
by photolithography using SPR 220–7 photoresist, exposed to UV light
using a Suss MA6 contact aligner and developed using MF-26 developer.
The channel features for the devices were etched by O2 reactive ion
etching (RIE) using a MARCH RIE system. Finally, the polymer thin ﬁlms
were deposited by spin coating 70 μL of prepared doped-polymer or
pristine-polymer solution on clean UV ozone-activated OECT substrates
at 500 rpm for 15 s, followed by 700 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the sacriﬁcial
top layer of Parylene C was peeled oﬀto pattern the polymer within the
OECT channels.
Organic Electrochemical Transistor Electrical Measurement and Analysis:
The OECT current–voltage characteristics were measured in ambient con-
ditions using a KEYSIGHT B2912A Precision Source/Measure Unit. A
0.1 m aqueous NaCl solution was used as the electrolyte for the OECTs,
with an Ag/AgCl gate electrode. The operational stability tests were car-
ried out by ﬁxing VG and VD at 0.4 V, and applying both for 2650 s. The
comparative output and transfer characteristics were normalized for their
respective ﬁlm thicknesses to account for the eﬀects of channel thickness
on the OECT current.[27] The threshold voltage was extracted from the re-
lationship between √ID and gate voltage (i.e., √ID and VG), as measured
from the transfer curves.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Capacitance Voltage:
EIS was used to determine the thin-ﬁlm capacitance values. Impedance
spectra were taken from 50 μm × 50 μm Au electrodes coated with the
n-doped and pristine polymer thin ﬁlms, which functioned as the working
electrodes in 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte solution. An Autolab poten-
tiostat was used to take the measurements in ambient conditions, using
a Ag/AgCl pellet as the reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter
electrode, with a 10 mV sine wave at frequencies from 1 × 105 to 0.1 Hz
and a −0.5 V DC oﬀset potential. Cyclic voltammetry data were taken at a
rate of 0.05 V s−1 for three cycles. The data analysis was then performed
using Metrohm Autolab NOVA software. The capacitance was normalized
by the ﬁlm volume to give volumetric capacitance.
Thickness Measurements:
A Dektak Proﬁlometer was used to measure
ﬁlm thickness of the polymer thin ﬁlms in the OECT channels. The ﬁnal
thickness value was taken as the average from three thickness measure-
ments within the channel.
Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy:
UPS measurements were per-
formed using a PHI 5600 UHV system coupled with a hemispherical elec-
tron energy analyzer and a multichannel detector with a 5.85 eV pass en-
ergy. An Excitech H Lyman-𝛼lamp (E-lux 121, 10.2 eV emission) was used
as the photon source with a 90° mirror (E-lux EEM Optical Module) and a
dry oxygen purge through the beam path between 7 and 10 Torr. A negative
5 V bias was applied to the samples during the measurements.
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance:
EPR spectra were recorded using
a Bruker EMX PremiumX at room temperature, with 15 dB microwave
attenuation, 100 kHz modulation frequency, and a modulation amplitude
of 1.00 G. EPR polymer solution samples were prepared at a concen-
tration of 10 mg mL−1 of pNDTI-TT polymer in chloroform. TBA-OH in
methanol solution was added to the polymer to form a 400 mol% doped
pNDTI-TT:TBA-OH solution. The same amount of methanol was added
to the polymer solution to form the pristine sample. Both samples were
left to rest for 24 h before EPR testing. EPR measurements were carried
out at room temperature, with identical sample sizes and measurement

conditions, to ensure the observed signal increase was only attributed to
the addition of the TBA-OH (Figure S4b, Supporting Information).
Atomic Force Microscopy:
Topographical information and surface
roughness measurements were taken using a Cypher S atomic force mi-
croscope operating in tapping mode. Thickness measurements were also
taken using the AFM and measuring the polymer thin-ﬁlm in the channel.
Data analysis was carried out using Igor Pro.
Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS):
Pristine and
400 mol% TBA-OH-doped pNDTI-TT polymer solutions (5 mg mL−1 in
chloroform) were spin coated onto silicon wafer substrates at 700 rpm.
One set of pristine and doped polymer substrates was soaked in 0.1 m
NaCl aqueous electrolyte solution for an extended amount of time (92 h).
GIWAXS data were collected for doped and undoped polymer substrates
allowed to soak in electrolyte and left in the original state. GIWAXS mea-
surements were carried out at the 11-BM Complex Materials Scattering
(CMS) beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II),
Brookhaven National Laboratory. X-rays with wavelength 0.0918 nm were
shone onto the thin-ﬁlm samples at the incident angle of 0.10°. The scat-
tering data were collected by Pilatus 800k detector located 260 mm away
from the samples, which were calibrated by silver behenate. The measure-
ments were performed in vacuum with the exposure time of 10 s to min-
imize the air scattering. The data reduction and analysis were performed
by SciAnalysis.
Density Functional Theory Calculations:
DFT calculations were per-
formed for pNDTI-TT- and pNDI-TT-based oligomers of ﬁve repeat units
each, with a long range corrected hybrid functional LC-𝜔HPBE, optimally
tuned with respect to both the HOMO and LUMO, and 6-31G* basis set.
The geometry was optimized for the neutral P and ionized P−oligomers,
as well as the oligomer–counterion complex [TBA+-P−] to obtain the dis-
tribution of the excess charge on the oligomer (polaron delocalization).
Charge model 5 (CM5)[87] was used to derive the partial atomic charges.
The optimized geometries were subsequently employed as the basis for
time-dependent DFT calculations to obtain excitation energies and oscil-
lator strengths, and an artiﬁcial broadening of 𝜎= 0.3 was applied to each
peak to establish the optical absorption spectra. All calculations were per-
formed using the Gaussian 16 Revision A.03 quantum chemical calcula-
tion package.[88]
