ABSTRACT: This work represents a joint computational and
experimental study on a series of n-ethylene glycol (PEOn)-
terminated quaterthiophene (4T) oligomers for 1 < n < 10 to
elucidate their self-assembly behavior into a smectic-like lamellar
phase. This study builds on an earlier study for n = 4 that showed
that our model predictions were consistent with experimental data
on the melting behavior and structure of the lamellar phase, with
the latter consisting of crystal-like 4T domains and liquid-like
PEO4 domains. The present study aims to understand how the
length of the terminal PEOn chains modulates the disordering
temperature of the lamellar phase and hence the relative stability of
the ordered structure. A simpliﬁed bilayer model, where the 4T
domains are not explicitly described, is put forward to eﬃciently
estimate the disordering eﬀect of the PEO domains with increasing n; this method is ﬁrst validated by correctly predicting that layers
of alkyl (PE)-capped 4T oligomers (for 1 < n < 10) stay ordered at room temperature. Both 4T-domain implicit and explicit model
simulations reveal that the order−disorder temperature decreases with the length of the PEO capping chains, as the associated
increase in conformational entropy drives a tendency toward disorder that overtakes the cohesive energy, keeping the ordered
packing of the 4T domains.
M
ixed ionic/electronic conducting (MIEC) organic
materials have garnered signiﬁcant interest as ingre-
dients for next-generation energy storage and separation
devices. Their application ranges from membranes for pure
oxygen production to thin wearable electronics.1−5 Oligothio-
phene moieties, capable of electronic conduction, combined
with poly(ethylene oxide)s (PEOs), capable of ionic
conduction, have been identiﬁed as promising building blocks
for mixed ionic/electronic conducting materials. Both
components have been well studied individually and
recognized as state-of-the-art materials for their respective
conducting properties; however, the characterization of the
structure and properties of materials where both of these
components are chemically linked and co-assembled has only
been explored in the case of polymers but not oligomers.6−8 In
our recent work, we explored this question by extensively
analyzing linear 4T/PEO4 oligomers using experiments and
molecular simulations.9 These molecules have a central core of
quarterthiophene rings (4T) connected on each side to
butylene-ethylene oxide (PEO4) groups. We observed that
these 4T/PEO4 molecules self-assemble into a smectic
morphology where the 4T cores packed in a crystalline order
similar to pure 4T, while the PEO4 tails formed intercalating
layers with minimal interdigitation across layers. These results
suggest that in this class of block oligomers the core thiophene
rings determine molecular packing, while the capping linear
oligomers have thermally mobile, relaxed conformations.
Ashizawa et al.10 observed an analogous layered morphology
when studying similar linear block molecules consisting of a 4T
core capped by alkyl chain (PE) chains (4T/PEn) (Figure
1(b)). While all the 4T/PEn materials studied were found to
be well ordered at room conditions, it is conjectured that PEO
units (replacing PE) would have a more disruptive eﬀect on
the ordered packing of 4T due to the lower melting points and
less congruent packing of PEO chains relative to alkyl chains
(for comparable molecular weights).11,12 Here, we use
molecular simulations to examine the eﬀect of varying the
number of units of PE and PEO on 4T to understand whether
and how the capping chains may enhance or disrupt the
smectic order. Since experimental studies of the phase behavior

of the 4T/PEOn (Figure 1(a)) oligomer series are lacking,
selected experiments for two of the 4T/PEOn oligomers are
also described to validate the simulation ﬁndings.
To support our conjecture that the formation of
intercalating layers for 4T/PEOn is primarily due to the
packing of 4T crystals and not to a microphase separation
driven by energetic (chemical) incompatibility between blocks
as seen in amorphous block copolymers, we estimate the
Flory−Huggins parameter (χ) based on the solubility
parameter δ of individual components13,14 for 4T/PEO4
using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. All simulations
were performed using LAMMPS,15 with the modiﬁed force
ﬁeld used in our previous simulation for 4T/PEO4.9 The
calculated δ values for 4T and PEO4 are 20.84 MPa1/2 and
21.0 MPa1/2, respectively, which gives χ4T‑PEO4 ∼0.007, i.e., a 0
< χN ≪1 for the 4T/PEO4 oligomer, indicative of very weak
incompatibility. A diblock oligomer with this value of χN
would be predicted to form a mixed disordered phase16 at
room temperature if both blocks were in an amorphous state.
However, this is inconsistent with both experiments and
simulations where a lamellar phase is observed. It is then clear
that the ordering in 4T/PEO4 must be driven by the tendency
of the 4T cores to crystallize, a process aided by both the π−π
interactions between thiophene rings9,17,18 and the intrinsic
backbone rigidity of the 4T units.
To probe how the structure of the PE and PEO tails may
aﬀect the stability of the lamellar phase, we ﬁrst study their
conformational behavior when grafted on a ﬂat surface in the
absence of 4T. The ﬂat grafting surface is used as a
minimalistic, simpliﬁed representation of the lamellar interface
adjacent to the 4T domain. A key quantity aﬀecting the
conformational entropy of the grafted chain on a ﬂat surface is
chain-grafting density,9 GD, deﬁned as the number of chains
per unit area. When GD is larger than the inverse square of the
area projected by the radius of gyration of the oligomer chains
on the xy-plane, (

, individual chains start overlapping
with adjacent chains, inducing strong steric hindrance and
excluded-volume interactions, leading to more extended and
stretched conformations of the brushes in the direction normal
to the substrate. Hence, the chain stretching (as captured by
the thickness of the PEO layer in 4T/PEOn) of the grafted
chain is strongly aﬀected by GD. Here, we mimic the chain
lateral density of 4T/PEn by grafting CH3−(CH2−CH2)n
(PEn) or CH3−(CH2−CH2−O)n (PEOn), where n = 1 to 10,
to the α carbon of 4T, which gives a signiﬁcantly high grafting
density of 7.1 nm−2. Thus, by keeping constant this GD, the
ﬂat surface (xy-plane) represents an idealization of the
interface between 4T and PEOn in the 4T/PEOn system.
We ﬁrst create a single layer of 400 grafting sites at z = 0 in a
simulation box with 7.5 × 7.5 × 12 nm. Note that the box is
signiﬁcantly larger along the z-axis to avoid periodic
interactions in that direction and thus initially creates a large
interlayer vacuum. Subsequently, the PEOn chains are grown
along the positive z-axis direction from the grafting points. The
nonbonded, bond, and angle potential parameters between
grafting points and grafted carbon PEOn are the same as those
of the α carbon in 4T and the α carbon in PEO. To prevent
chains from going below the grafting points (negative z), we
add a reﬂective wall19 at z = 0. The single layer of grafted
PEOn is allowed to relax at constant volume and T = 300 K
(NVT ensemble) for 5 ns. Since the goal is to mimic smectic
order, as seen in 4T/PEO4,9 after stabilizing the single grafted
layer, we create a bilayer by replicating and inverting the single
layer in the z-axis, thus making it nonperiodic in that direction
and periodic in the x- and y-axis directions. This also results in
an initial empty region between the two layers in the z-
direction. On simulating the bilayer at 300 K for 500 ps under
NVT conditions, we observe the value of the z-component of
the pressure tensor, pzz, to be negative due to the presence of
interlayer vacuum. Since pzz should be minimal when internal
stresses are eliminated and approach zero (or 1 bar) when the
layer thickness attains a mechanically stable thickness, we ﬁnd
the minimum value of pzz
2 using the gradient descent method
for varying interlayer separation. The distance between the
layers (thickness) is changed by moving the grafting points and
the reﬂective wall closer to each other in the z-axis, resulting in
reduced volume due to the removal of the excess vacuum

(Figure 2). Note that the grafting points are not allowed to
move in the xy-plane to maintain the “crystal order” (of the
implicit 4T layer). The equilibrated bilayer thickness is seen to
increase linearly with n for the two systems (Figure S2 in the
SI). This linear correlation is characteristic of a strongly
stretched regime for linear chains grafted on a ﬂat surface, as
reﬂected by the end-to-end distance values of the grafted
chains in the z-direction (Figure S3 in the SI). In this regime,
conformational changes (and the entropy generation) are more
limited along the z-axis than along lateral (x−y) directions,
resulting in increased lateral ﬂuctuations of the chains around
the mean position with an increase in n.20−22
To indirectly probe the increase in conﬁgurational entropy
with chain length, we calculate the statistical average of the
projected end-to-end distance of each oligomer on the xy-plane
(Rxy) (Figure S4a in the SI). Rxy increases with n for both
oligomers; however, PEOn increases more rapidly than PEn.
To check if this disparity is related to the larger size of the PEO
unit, we scaled n by the maximum possible length of the units
in the all-trans state. Even after accounting for this size eﬀect,
we found that the trend persists (Figure S4b in the SI),
indicative of higher conﬁgurational entropy in PEOn than in
PEn chains for n > 2. Note that Rxy would be expected to scale
as n2 for self-avoiding chains grafted at a high GD on a ﬂat
surface;23 however, since the n is small and we are operating in
the highly stretched “rod-like” regime, we observe a linear
scaling between Rxy and n. Figure 1(d) shows the P21/a
packing (primitive lattice with a 2-fold screw axis along a) of
the thiophene rings with a nearest intermolecular distance
between two α carbons of p = 0.53 nm. Note that the distance
p is larger than the π−π interaction distances of 0.39 and 0.44
nm as seen in our previous work.9,18 Since p could be seen as a
distance characterizing the ideal packing of 4T, the diﬀerence
(2Rxy −p)/p can be seen as a dimensionless metric of packing
looseness “PL” at the given temperature. A positive and larger
PL would be indicative of looser packing and hence larger
lateral freedom and entropy. We hence hypothesize that for PL
> 0 or 2Rxy > p the 4T packing may become destabilized. Note
that PL > 0 need not guarantee instability of the smectic layer;
rather, it would be a minimum threshold for it to happen. As
seen in Figure 1(c), PL < 0 (2Rxy < p) for PE even with n = 10.
However, a PL > 0 for PEO with n = 5 implies a tendency for
instability of 4T/PEOn for n ≥5 at the simulated temperature
of 300 K (Figure 1a).
To test the hypothesis that the stability of the end-capped
4T systems can be estimated by calculating PL of grafted
chains, we performed an all-atom simulation for 4T/PEOn at n
= 3, 4, 5, and 6. Initial conﬁgurations are created using the ﬁnal
equilibrated PEO chains and reconstructing the 4T crystal
structure from the grafted positions (Figure S1 in the SI). To
map the thermal stability and morphological changes of 4T/
PEOn systems, we heated sequentially the system from 300 to

460 K in 10 K increments. At each temperature, the system
was annealed for 10 ns to try to achieve equilibrium before
taking the next step and calculating densities and other
material properties. On comparing the change of density with
temperature (Figure S5 in the SI), we observed no abrupt
changes that could be indicative of a ﬁrst-order phase
transition. However, visually we could observe an increase in
the ﬂuctuations of the molecular average positions, suggestive
of melting. Hence, to try to detect when melting occurs, we
calculated the Lindemann Parameter24 (δL) for the thiophene
rings, where δL is deﬁned as the ratio of the root-mean-square
ﬂuctuation in atomic positions about the equilibrium lattice
positions and the nearest-neighbor distance (p). Since in 4T/
PEOn we want to capture the disordering of the smectic layer
of thiophene rings, we measure δL for the center of mass of
thiophene rings only. The threshold value for melting is
generally considered as 15%, but it may vary between 5% and
20% depending on such factors as crystal structure, nature of
interparticle interactions, and magnitude of nonclassical
eﬀects.25 As shown in Figure 3(a), the critical value of δL for
4T/PEOn materials is around 5−10%, resulting in a melting
point of 400, 380, 350, and 310 K for n = 3, 4, 5, and 6,
respectively. Thus, the smectic order of 4T/PEO6 is found to
be unstable near room-temperature conditions, consistent with
the prediction of our earlier hypothesis based on the behavior
of Rxy (PL) of the model-grafted bilayer system. These
calculations are only intended to detect the onset of
disordering (when δL increases rapidly) as the behavior of
the curves for δL > 5−10% is largely uninformative. We also
performed the same analysis for 4T/PEn for n = 3, 4, 5, and 6
and found the melting points to be higher than 380 K in each
case (Figure S6 in the SI), consistent with available
experimental data.10 We further explored the eﬀect of n on
the potential energy between the components, and found
results consistent with those obtained using the δL (Figures
S7−9 in the SI).
To experimentally verify that the simulation results are
capturing the correct trend in melting behavior with n, we also
conducted the synthesis and characterization of 4T/PEO4 and
4T/PEO5 systems. We choose 4T/PEO5 for experimental
characterization in addition to 4T/PEO4 since simulation
predicted at 300 K 4T/PEOn undergoes order−disorder
transition from n = 4 to n = 5 (Figure 1). The synthetic
procedures of both compounds are shown in Figure S11 in the
SI. At room temperature (near 300 K), 4T/PEO4 appears as a
solid powder, whereas 4T/PEO5 appears as a sticky substance.
The TGA curves (Figure S12a) suggest that both compounds
remain thermally stable below 473 K, which is within the DSC
temperature range (183−473 K) as shown in the heating cycle
in Figure 4a. For 4T/PEO4, only a singular phase transition
between smectic and isotropic melt shows up at around 367
K,9 whereas for 4T/PEO5 a broader transition peak centered
near 340 K is observed (indicated by the shaded areas). Such
observations are consistent with the simulation trends of
Figure 3 in that longer PEO chains result in lower melting
point. The phases of both 4T/PEO4 and 4T/PEO5 were also
characterized by POM. As can be seen in Figure 4b and 4c,
fan-shaped textures, typical for smectic phases, are observed for
both 4T/PEO4 and 4T/PEO5 at below the melting temper-
ature, while black, featureless POM images are observed above
the melting point for both compounds. This observation
further supports that the transition temperature detected by
DSC and simulation is indeed an LC order−disorder
transition. To further verify that 4T crystallization controls
the self-assembly behavior of 4T/PEOn systems, we employed
T-dependent WAXS experiments to investigate both the π−π
interaction and smectic ordering of 4T/PEO4 and 4T/PEO5.
Consistent with simulation results and DSC scans, we observe
an order−disorder transition for 4T/PEO4 at 393 K and a
broad transition for 4T/PEO5 centered around 350 K (Figure
S14 in SI).
It has been a long-standing assumption that in this class of
oligothiophenes, with terminal thiophene rings containing
functionalized end-capping chains at their α-positions, the
molecules would behave either like liquid crystals or like block
copolymers depending on molecular weight.26−29 However,
our simulations paint a somewhat diﬀerent and more nuanced
picture. The smectic morphology observed here is primarily
driven by the crystal structure of thiophene packing, while the
functionalized groups at the end serve largely as space ﬁllers
between the ordered thiophene cores. This results in a
nanosegregated two-domain structure where one domain is
highly ordered and (nearly) crystalline (thiophene), while the
other is less ordered and liquid-like (PEO capping groups). As
the length of the capping chains increases, their associated
increase in conﬁgurational entropy drives a tendency toward
“liquidity” or disorder that eventually becomes comparable to
the energetic attractive forces, keeping the ordered packing of
the thiophene rings. This increased mobility of the capping
chains “jiggles” the thiophene rings toward states of higher
translational entropy and thus to the destabilization of their
ordered packing. Because the ordered morphology is primarily
governed by thiophene packing, to a ﬁrst approximation the
conformational behavior of the capping chains can be

computationally studied independently (as grafted chains in a
bilayer) to eﬃciently identify trends with chain length,
temperature, or other parameters. In the future, a similar
approach could be used to eﬃciently test diﬀerent chemical
compositions of capping groups, calculating readily accessible
properties as surrogates for the entropic forces driving the
destabilization of the ordered domains (formed by thiophene
or other units30). A rigorous approach to such tests would
involve very expensive free-energy calculations to determine
the melting behavior of each system of interest. The
approximate approaches advocated here could be further
extended to describe phases with diﬀerent noncrystalline
domain geometries27 (besides a slab) and are hence expected
to be a valuable addition to the toolbox used by simulators for
a faster discovery of useful mixed ionic−electronic conducting
materials.
