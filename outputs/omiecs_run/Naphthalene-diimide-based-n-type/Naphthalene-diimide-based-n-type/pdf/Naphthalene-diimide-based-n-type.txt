Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs), which transport both ionic and electronic charges,
development are important for progressing bioelectronic and energy storage devices. The p-type
OMIECs are extensively investigated and used in various applications, whereas the n-type ones lag far
behind due to their moisture and air instability. Here, we report the synthesis of the novel n-type
naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based small-molecule OMIECs for organic electrochemical transistors
(OECTs). The electro-active NDI molecule with the linear ethylene glycol side chains is a promising
candidate for n-type channel material to obtain accumulation mode OECTs. This NDI-based small-
molecule OMIEC, gNDI-Br2, demonstrates ion permeability due to the attachment of the glycol side
chains with optimized ionic-electronic conductions. OECT devices with gNDI-Br2 channel material
displays excellent performance in water and ambient stability. OECTs fabricated with two diﬀerent
concentrations, 50 mg mL−1 and 100 mg mL−1 of gNDI-Br2 demonstrate a transconductance value of
344 ± 19.7 mS and 814 ± 124.2 mS with the mobility capacitance product (mC*) of 0.13 ± 0.03 F cm−1 V−1
s−1 and 0.23 ± 0.04 F cm−1 V−1 s−1, respectively. These results demonstrate the n-type OMIEC
behaviour of the NDI-based small-molecule and its applicability as an OECT channel material.
Introduction
The organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) have
received quite a bit of attention in the past few decades due to
their unique conduction mechanism. OMIECs, mostly p-
conjugated polymers or small molecule organic conductors, are
capable of transporting both the ionic and electronic charges
throughout the bulk material.1 The charge transport properties
of the mixed conductors can be manipulated by their molecular
alignment, ion-penetration capability, material morphology,
and crystallinity.2 To date, many OMIECs have been reported
and applied to applications including neuromorphic, batteries,
and bioelectronics, thanks to their exibility, low fabrication
cost, and biocompatibility.3–5
OMIECs have been employed as the active channel material
for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) because of their
redox activity and ability to convert ionic charges to electronic
ones.6,7
Unlike
the
interfacial
doping
of
the
organic
semiconductors which is involved in the conduction for the
organic eld-eﬀect transistors, OMIECs can change their
doping status by the three-dimensional ion inux from the
electrolyte to the channel material.8 The bulk of the electro-
active OMIECs channels in the OECTs are doped and dedoped
during the measurement by the ionic and electronic mixed
conduction with electrolytes.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most common OMIEC material
for the OECT active channel.9 It is a hole-transporting p-type
material, and PEDOT:PSS-based OECT operates as a depletion
mode (normally ON) device.10 PEDOT:PSS based OECT are being
used
for
diverse
biosensing
applications,
including
ion,
enzyme,
and
immunosensors.11–13
PEDOT:PSS
is
a
two-
component system that blends polyelectrolyte and conjugated
polymer based on the OMIECs classication.1,14 Another type of
OMIECs material is the block system which is a single molecule
conglomerated with ionic and electronic conductors. Block
copolymers such as PFO-b-P3PyHY15 and P3EHT-b-PEO16 can be
classied as this type of OMIECs. The homogeneous system is
another class of OMIECs that has been reported recently. For
example, p(g2T-TT)17 and p(gNDI-gT2)18 have the form of the
copolymer and provide both ionic and electronic conductions
through the whole molecules.
Despite the numerous developments of the p-type OMIECs,
the research for an electron transporting n-type one has been far
less conducted due to its air and moisture instability and low

electron mobility. Only a few studies of n-type OMIECs have
been published compared to the p-type materials, including
p(gNDI-gT2),18 poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL),19
NDI-T2 copolymers,20 and 2-(2,3,4-tris(methoxtriglycol)phenyl)
[60]fulleropyrrolidine (C60-TEG).21 However, the properties of n-
type OMIECs, such as stability in ambient conditions, gure of
merit products or charge carrier mobility, are still not compa-
rable to their p-type OMIEC counterparts.22,23 Recently reported
NDI-T2 based n-type polymeric material, p(C6-T2), and fused
bithiophene imide (BTI) derivatives n-type OMIEC, f-BTI2TEG-
FT exhibit gure of merit products of 1.29 and 15.2 F cm−1
V−1 s−1, respectively.24,25
Naphthalenediimide (NDI), one of the rylene diimide deriv-
atives, is a promising n-type organic semiconductor for the
applications
such
as
batteries,
organic
solar
cells,
and
transistors.26–28 Thanks to advantages like material stability and
solubility, NDI has been used for numerous organic electronics
as a small molecule and applied as an acceptor monomer unit
for donor–acceptor (D–A) n-type copolymers.29,30 In 2016, Gio-
vannitti et al. reported the rst NDI-based ambipolar D–A
copolymer for accumulation mode OECT.18 They synthesized
p(gNDI-gT2) copolymer based on NDI acceptor and bithiophene
donor with a linear glycolated side chain. The material has
a narrow bandgap and is an ambipolar material due to its high
electron aﬃnity and low ionization potential value. The poly-
meric OMIEC is easily processable with an organic solvent such
as CHCl3 and has high stability with water and ambient
conditions.
In this work, we synthesized a small-molecule NDI-based
organic mixed conductor, gNDI-Br2.18 This glycolated NDI
small-molecule OMIEC acts as an n-type active channel material
for accumulation mode OECTs. NDI small molecule is a typical
organic semiconductor that has been used as the channel
material for organic eld-eﬀect transistors.31 However, the
mixed ionic-electronic conduction phenomenon of the NDI-
based small-molecule has not been reported for n-type accu-
mulation OECT yet. Here, we demonstrate the potential of the
NDI-based small-molecule organic mixed conductor as an active
channel material for OECTs with the material's explanation and
characterization. Our synthesized gNDI-Br2 thin lm exhibited
a high volumetric capacitance (C*) of 203.2 F cm−3. We fabri-
cated gNDI-Br2 OECT with two diﬀerent concentrations, 50 mg
mL−1 and 100 mg mL−1, respectively. We observe a trans-
conductance (gm) value of 344 ± 19.7 mS and 814 ± 124.2 mS for
50 mg mL−1 and 100 mg mL−1, respectively. This is the rst
report of demonstration of NDI small-molecule as an eﬃcient
OMIEC. Small molecules are easily solution processed and can
be printed and hence this will contribute to the progress of n-
type organic semiconductors.
Experimental section
gNDI-Br2 synthesis
2,6-Dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic
dianhydride
was purchased from TCI, and it was used to synthesize gNDI-Br2
with two linear glycol side chains under the N2 atmosphere
following the procedure developed by Giovannitti et al.18 The
detailed synthesis method is provided in the ESI.†
Thin-lm preparation
The substrates were cleaned with acetone, isopropanol (IPA),
and DI water sequentially for 2 minutes using the sonicator. For
each experiment, the gNDI-Br2 was dissolved in anhydrous
CHCl3 at diﬀerent concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and
100 mg mL−1). Each concentration of the gNDI-Br2 solution was
drop-casted onto a clean substrate, annealed at 40 °C on a hot-
plate for 24 hours, and kept in the desiccator to ensure the
solvent was entirely removed before characterization.
Material characterization
1H and 13C were carried out with Varian VNMRS 600. Puried
gNDI-Br2 was dissolved in CDCl3, and the spectra were gathered
for structural analysis. Attenuated total reection FT-IR spec-
trum was collected using Thermo-Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spec-
trometer. 50 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2 solution was drop-casted onto
the silicon (100) substrate and the transmission was acquired
over a spectral range of 4000 to 400 cm−1 with 4 cm−1 resolution
and 32 cycles. UV-vis spectroscopy was carried out with Perki-
nElmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer to gather the absor-
bance of the gNDI-Br2 thin lm. 50 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2 solution
was drop-casted onto a quartz substrate, and the spectrum was
collected over a wavelength range of 300 to 700 nm with a scan
speed of 266.75 nm min−1. UPS was performed with Kratos AXIS
UPS. The drop-casted thin lm of 50 mg mL−1 solution of gNDI-
Br2 onto the silicon (100) substrate was used for the experiment.
UPS was measured with an HeI source. A −10 V bias was applied
to the sample, and the power was 60 W (3 kV × 20 mA).
Morphology and crystallinity characterization
Thin lms of gNDI-Br2 were prepared by drop-casting the gNDI-
Br2 solution with diﬀerent concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
and 100 mg mL−1 in CHCl3) onto silicon (100) substrates and
imaged using a Zeiss EVO M10 SEM. 50 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2
solution was drop-casted onto a silicon (100) substrate and
annealed at 40 °C for 24 hours. Atomic force microscope was
performed in an ambient atmosphere using Bruker Dimension
Edge system. Tapping mode was used to image drop-casted
gNDI-Br2 thin lm (50 mg mL−1) on a silicon (100) substrate.
Sample roughness was calculated by Nanoscope Analysis so-
ware. GIWAXS was carried out at the Canadian Light Source at
Brockhouse diﬀraction sector-undulator beamline (BXDS-IVU).
50 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2 solution was drop-casted to form a thin
lm on a silicon (100) substrate for the experiment. The applied
energy was 9.96 keV with an incidence angle of 0.2°, and the
sample to the Rayonix MX300HE 2D detector distance was
588.7 mm with the LaB6 standard calibration. The 2D data was
analyzed with GSAS II and GIXSGUI soware.32 GIXRD was
performed by the Bruker D8 discover with a Vantec-500 2D
detector. The data was collected from the incidence angle of 2q
from 1.2° to 30° with a step size of 0.01°.

Electrochemical characterization
Gamry Reference 600+ potentiostat with the standard three-
electrode conguration was used for all electrochemical char-
acterizations. For the Spectroelectrochemical measurement,
gNDI-Br2 thin lm deposited onto ITO coated glass slide was
used as the working electrode. This lm was immersed in
100 mM NaCl with a platinum counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl
(in 3 M NaCl) reference electrode in a 3 mL standard cuvette. A
negative bias of −0.6 V to 0 V with a step size of 0.1 V was
applied to the gNDI-Br2 lm with respect to the Ag/AgCl. The
absorbance spectrum was measured with PerkinElmer Lambda
900 spectrophotometer at each applied potential. The scan
range is from 300 to 700 nm with a scan speed of 266.75
nm min−1. Before the electrochemical cyclic voltammetry of
gNDI-Br2, Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated using
5 mM of K4Fe(CN)6 in acetonitrile with 100 mM tetrabuty-
lammonium hexauorophosphate (TBAPF6) supporting elec-
trolyte. Then, 5 mM of gNDI-Br2 was dissolved in freshly-
degassed acetonitrile with 100 mM of TBAPF6 supporting elec-
trolyte. For three-electrode system, two of platinum wires were
used for counter and working electrodes and a Ag/AgCl in 3 M
KCl was used as the reference electrode. The potential was
applied from −0.8 to 1.3 V with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and
a step size of 1 mV. Cyclic voltammetry was measured for ve
cycles, and the second cycle was used for the analysis. The
working
electrode
was
prepared
for
the
electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy by drop-casting gNDI-Br2 thin-lm
from the 50 mg mL−1 solution on top of the aerosol jet prin-
ted gold electrode on a 125 mm polyimide substrate. An exper-
iment was performed using a platinum counter and Ag/AgCl (in
3 M NaCl) reference electrode in 100 mM NaCl electrolyte. The
frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz for an AC voltage of 10 mV
rms was used. During the measurement, specic DC potential
applied from +0.1 to −0.3 V with a step size of 0.1 V. The
capacitance was estimated using the Randles equivalent circuit,
R(RjjC). All electrochemical measurement data were analyzed
using the Gamry Echem Analyst soware.
OECT device fabrication and characterization
For the source/drain electrode fabrication, Si/SiO2 substrates
were thoroughly cleaned using piranha solution, and hexame-
thyldisilazane (HMDS) was deposited in the oven for 15 min. AZ
5214E photoresist was spin-coated and baked, and exposed with
a photomask using a mask aligner and developed with an MF-
319 developer for patterning the electrodes. 5 nm of titanium
(Ti) and 100 nm of gold (Au) was deposited via the magnetron
sputtering system, and li-oﬀwas performed with acetone to
obtain the source and drain electrodes. 0.2 mL of 50 mg mL−1
and 100 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2 solution was drop-casted between
the source and drain electrodes to form an active channel for
OECT. A 100 mM NaCl solution was applied onto the gNDI-Br2
OECT channel, and an Ag/AgCl gate electrode was placed in the
electrolyte without touching the channel surface. The electrical
measurement was conducted using Keithley 2612b sourcemeter
controlled by a customized LabVIEW. Current–voltage (IV)
characteristics were collected with the gate voltage (VG) was
stepped from 0.2 V to 0.4 V with an increment of 0.05 V while
sweeping the drain voltage (VD) from −0.1 V to 0.8 V with an
increment of 0.02 V. The OECT device was tested 8–10 times to
conrm its repeatability. The device was rinsed with DI water to
remove
NaCl
electrolyte
residue
between
the
diﬀerent
measurements. The repeated cycling measurement was carried
out with a BK precision 4055 function waveform generator and
a Keithley 2612b sourcemeter controlled by a custom-made
LabVIEW. While applying a constant bias at the drain, a rect-
angular wave gate voltage with an amplitude of 0.5 V, the pulse
width of the 30 s, and a 50% duty cycle was applied at the gate
for 36 min, and the drain current was measured.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of gNDI-Br2
gNDI-Br2 synthesis scheme is depicted in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†
Originally, gNDI-Br2 was used as a monomer for the rst re-
ported n-type OMIEC for OECT, p(gNDI-gT2).18 We synthesized
gNDI-Br2 monomer and tested its possibility for OMIEC mate-
rial. NMR was executed to analyze the structure, and 1H and 13C-
NMR spectra are provided in Fig. S2 and S3.† FT-IR was con-
ducted to conrm the material structure from the NMR result,
and the spectrum is in Fig. S4.† Fig. S5† is the ESI-TOF mass
spectrum and it was performed with Agilent TOF 6220. The
calculated mass by the ESI-ToF is 918.11 g mol−1, and it
corresponds to the molecular mass of gNDI-Br2.18
Material morphology
To investigate the material morphology and crystallinity of the
gNDI-Br2 thin-lm, SEM, GIWAXS, and GIXRD were performed.
Fig. 1 and ESI Fig. S6† show the SEM images of thin lms made
from drop-casting gNDI-Br2 with diﬀerent concentrations (5–
100 mg mL−1). The lm continuity is one of the important
features for OMIECs to connect and provide conductivity to the
source/drain electrodes. A continuous gNDI-Br2 thin lm acts as
an active channel in the OECT, and SEM has been employed to
nd out gNDI-Br2 thin lm morphology.
Fig. 1(a) (5 mg mL−1) shows that the material does not fully
spread onto the substrate due to the low weight percentage of
gNDI-Br2 solution and the lm has lots of voids. Due to the high
volatility of the CHCl3, gNDI-Br2 thin-lm possesses voids
leading to a discontinuous lm with thickness variation. With
the
increment
of
the
gNDI-Br2
concentrations,
material
morphology is improved. Fig. 1(b) and S6(a)–(c)† are the
samples for the 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg mL−1 of gNDI-Br2. This
lm still has voids and agglomerated gNDI-Br2 molecules, but
the amount of unoccupied parts between the self-assembled
NDI
molecules
decreases
as
the
solution
concentration
increases.
Fig. 1(c) and (d) show the SEM images for the thin lms
deposited using 50 and 100 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2, respectively.
With a solution concentration higher than 50 mg mL−1 gNDI-
Br2 we observe a continuous thin lm as seen in the enlarged
view (1000× in 50 mg mL−1) shown in Fig. S6(d).† Densely
packed thin lms of NDI cause the improvement of the

electronic
conductivity
of
the
gNDI-Br2
organic
mixed
conductor. The molecular entanglement facilitates p–p inter-
action and leads to higher intermolecular charge transfer,
contributing to the improved charge transport of this gNDI-Br2
thin lms. To measure the gNDI-Br2 thin lm roughness,
atomic force microscopy was used. Fig. S7† shows the AFM scan
of a 50 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2 solution drop-casted lm with root-
mean-square roughness (Rq) of 375 nm.
The drop-casted gNDI-Br2 thin lm microstructure was
observed by the two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle
X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to elucidate material morphology.
The NDI small-molecule organic semiconductors are well-
known as brick-wall packing materials deposited by sublima-
tion or vapour technique. Due to the enhanced p–p interaction
between the polycyclic naphthalene ring in the NDI core
molecules (Fig. 2(a)), piled-up NDI organic semiconductors
retain high electronic charge mobility.33 However, as Fig. 2(b)
depicts, solution-processed gNDI-Br2 demonstrates ring-like
shapes, unlike other OMIECs or NDI derivatives. The isotropic
2D GIWAXS patterns demonstrate that the gNDI-Br2 molecules
are irregularly stacked on the substrate, and there is no fav-
oured crystallographic arrangement.34,35
The gNDI-Br2 molecular skeleton is illustrated in Fig. 2(a),
and the distance between any two atoms is calculated using
ChemBio3D soware. There are two possible packing motifs of
lamellar stacking for the NDI small-molecules, herringbone and
brick-wall stacking.36,37 The 2D GIWAXS patterns in Fig. 2(b)
show ring-like scattering, and it provides peaks at similar q
vectors. In the out-of-plane and in-plane line cuts, two signi-
cant and sharp reections are observed, and it represent
herringbone and brick-layer stacking motifs.
The calculated d-spacing from the rst strong peak appears
at qz = 0.195 Å−1 (d = 32.22 Å) in Fig. 2(c) and qr = 0.185 Å−1 (d =
33.96 Å) in Fig. 2(d). It is shorter than the estimated gNDI-Br2
molecules, including the linear glycol side chains (∼42.57 Å).
This indicates a herringbone motif of lamellar-like scattering of
the gNDI-Br2 with a maximum angle of ∼23° on both qr and qz
direction. Another possible lamellar-like scattering of gNDI-Br2
is a brick-layer motif. The intermolecular d-spacing between
each gNDI-Br2 molecule is ∼23 Å. The observed peaks observed
at qz = 0.262 Å−1 (d = 23.98 Å) and qr = 0.255 Å−1 (d = 24.64 Å)
from in-plane and out-of-plane line cuts match this brick-layer
motif intermolecular d-spacing well.
The fully extended length of the linear glycolated side chain
of the gNDI-Br2 is 18.78 Å. Due to this, the third strongest out-of-
plane peak measured at qz = 0.389 Å−1 (d = 16.2 Å) in Fig. 2(c)
implies edge-to-face stacking interaction between two gNDI-Br2
molecules.38 There are weak out-of-plane scattering peaks at
higher qz = 1.59 Å−1 (d = 3.95 Å), and 1.8 Å−1 (d = 3.49 Å). Weak
and small peaks represent the p–p spacing between the core of
the NDI molecules. These peaks are observed only in out-of-
plane line cuts and they indicate two diﬀerent spacing due to
the irregular distribution and entanglement of the gNDI-Br2
molecules.

GIXRD result of gNDI-Br2 was measured to conrm the result
of GIWAXS. In Fig. S8(b),† it only shows the out-of-plane line
cuts along with qz direction, unlike GIWAXS. For the qz direction
peaks, due to the higher incidence angle of the GIXRD (1.2°)
than GIWAXS (0.2°), GIXRD cannot detect the peak at qz = 0.159
Å−1. The measured peak at GIXRD at qz = 0.261 Å−1 corresponds
to the GIWAXS peak at qz = 0.262 Å−1. Other signicant peaks
from GIXRD are qz = 1.31, 1.46, and 1.61 Å−1. These are similar
to the GIWAXS weak and broad peak at qz = 1.59 Å−1.
Material optical and electrochemical properties
The reduction–oxidation ability and HOMO/LUMO level of
gNDI-Br2 were investigated by electrochemical cyclic voltam-
metry in organic solution, and the result is depicted in Fig. 3(a).
The reduction reaction of gNDI-Br2 between neutral and
reduced states was observed from 0 to −0.5 V. Tetrabuty-
lammonium cations in the electrolyte compensate for the
negatively charged gNDI-Br2 molecules during the reduction.
The LUMO level of the gNDI-Br2 was calculated from the
reduction onset (Ered) on cyclic voltammogram, and it was
4.12 eV. This high LUMO level contributes to the air and
moisture stability of the NDI material, which makes this gNDI-
Br2 small molecule very stable and suitable as OECT channel
material.39 In addition, gNDI-Br2 demonstrated the oxidation
reaction between 0.9 and 1.2 V and the calculated HOMO level
from oxidation onset (Eox) is 5.33 eV.40
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed
to determine the ionization potential (IP) of gNDI-Br2 in vacuo,
and the spectrum is depicted in Fig. 3(b). The IP of the gNDI-Br2
small-molecule organic semiconductor can be calculated to be
5.2 eV using eqn (1).41
Ionization potential (IP) = hn −Ecut-off + EHOMO
(1)
where hn is the photon energy from helium ion (HeI) radiation
(21.2 eV), Ecut-oﬀis the secondary electron cut-oﬀ, and EHOMO is
the onset of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
level.
UV-vis absorption spectrum of the gNDI-Br2 on the solid-
state is depicted in Fig. 3(c). From the UV-vis absorption spec-
trum, three absorption peaks (lmax) were observed at 380 (l1),
401 (l2), and 422 (l3) nm. The intensity of absorption maxima
decreases as the wavelength increases (l3–l2–l1). All three lmax
are the result of the p–p* transition between the NDI mole-
cules.42 Unlike the D-A polymer, p(gNDI-gT2), gNDI-Br2 only
shows p–p* transition, not the broad intramolecular charge
transfer (ICT). The optical bandgap (Eg,opt) is 1.83 eV, extracted
using the Tauc plot method.
Spectroelectrochemical measurement was carried out to study
the electrochemical doping process of gNDI-Br2. The electro-
chemical interaction between ion and gNDI-Br2 can be observed
by applying a specic potential range to the material. This change
in doping modulates material electrochromic properties and

trochemical measurement result of gNDI-Br2, and it shows two
new absorption peaks at 565 and 620 nm aer applying a DC
potential of −0.4 V. This change of absorption spectra from the
spectroelectrochemical measurement at −0.4 V correlates with
the reduction peak from the cyclic voltammetry of gNDI-Br2. The
gNDI-Br2 is reduced from the neutral state when a higher nega-
tive potential is applied, and the intensity for both absorption
peaks increases. In the −0.3 to −0.6 V range the p–p* absorption
peaks at 380 nm (l1) and 401 nm (l2) for diminish but the peak at
420 nm (l3) is still present. Once the applied voltage is higher
than −0.6 V, a signicant decrease of absorbance was observed
due to over-reduction and delamination of the gNDI-Br2 lm. As
the absorption properties vary with the change of the electronic
band
structures,
the
spectroelectrochemical
measurement
conrms that gNDI-Br2 has the bulk doping transition capability,
which is essential for being applicable as the OECT channel
material.44

measurement data for the synthesized gNDI-Br2. gNDI-Br2
optical bandgap (Eg,opt) was extracted from the thin-lm UV-vis
spectroscopy as 1.83 eV. The IP of this material was measured by
UPS and corroborated by the CV measurement. The IP from the
UPS and HOMO level from cyclic voltammetry are 5.2 eV and
5.33 eV, respectively, which indicates that both techniques give
us similar results. The electrochemical bandgap DE was esti-
mated as 1.21 eV using the HOMO and LUMO level from the CV.
This narrow bandgap of gNDI-Br2 facilitates charge injection by
reducing the barrier between the gold source/drain electrodes
to the material.45

The eﬀective capacitance values of OMIECs determine the
feasibility of the material as the active channel for OECTs.
OECTs require volumetric doping through the entire OMIECs
material, whereas the electrolyte-gated organic eld-eﬀect
transistor (EGOFET) channel only requires a eld-eﬀect capac-
itive process at the interfaces between the channel material and
electrolytes.46 Eﬀective capacitance values of the OMIECs for
OECTs are more signicant than the ones for EGOFETs,47 and
this can be extracted from the electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS). gNDI-Br2 coated gold working electrode
(3.23 × 10−3 cm2) was immersed into the electrochemical cells
with 100 mM NaCl electrolyte solutions to conduct the EIS
measurements, shown in Fig. 4. The eﬀective capacitance per
unit area at the applied DC potential of −0.3 V is estimated as
2.46 × 10−2 F cm−2. The thickness of the gNDI-Br2 thin lm
measured by a prolometry is 1.21 mm, and the volumetric
capacitance (C*) was extracted to be 203.2 F cm−3. This value is
comparable to the C* value of C60-TEG (220 ± 50 F cm−3),
previously reported n-type small-molecule OMIEC.21
The high volumetric capacitance of gNDI-Br2 with the
comparison of the EGOFET channel material tells another
possibility of material as an OMIEC, not only the organic
semiconductors. Owing to its high eﬀective capacitance, the
synthesized gNDI-Br2 can accumulate charges throughout the
entire volume of the channel. The reduction–oxidation behav-
iour from the CV, bulk doping capability from the spectroelec-
trochemical results, and high volumetric capacitance value
from the EIS are signicant evidence that this gNDI-Br2 can be
a strong candidate for the new type of OMIECs material.
As a small molecule organic mixed conductor, the NDI
molecule has strong p–p intermolecular interactions between
the NDI core naphthalene rings. The two-electron reaction is
expected from the NDI from the polycyclic rings of the naph-
thalene molecule. It makes the NDI a redox-active material due
to the transport of the electron between the NDI molecule and
electrolyte.48 Fig. 5(a) represents a feasible electrochemical
reduction reaction of gNDI-Br2 with metal ions such as Na+ or
K+ from the electrolyte. Two carboxylic oxygen at the NDI
naphthalene rings can be coupled with the metal ions as an
active site. The excess electron from the reduction process of the
NDI can transport to the other NDI molecules through its p-
conjugated structure. This reduction reaction of NDI small
molecules with electrolytes gives the prospect of an n-type active
channel material for OECTs. The electrochemical response of
the gNDI-Br2 is described in eqn (2).

The linear ethylene glycol side chain attached to the NDI core
molecule provides better solubility and ionic conductivity.
Without additional side chains, NDI can only be dissolved in
few halogenated and aromatic solvents which are complicated
to remove.28 By adding the glycol side chains to the NDI, gNDI-
Br2 can be dissolved in common organic solvents, such as
acetone and CHCl3. The improved solubility of gNDI-Br2 facili-
tates device fabrication with low temperature solution-based
techniques such as drop-casting and spin-coating. In addi-
tion, the hydrophilic glycol chains at both sides of the gNDI-Br2
will attract water molecules and ions. Injected ions can be
transported along the glycol side chains of a gNDI-Br2 molecule
and in between neighboring gNDI-Br2 molecules, which assists
in the ionic conduction and electrochemical doping of the
material.1
The microscopic image of the small-molecule OECT was
depicted in Fig. 5(b), and the IV characteristics were obtained
with 100 mM NaCl electrolyte and Ag/AgCl gate electrode. The
output characteristics of the 50 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2 OECT device
is shown in Fig. 5(c), it can be seen that the drain current (ID)
increases with the drain potential (VD) under constant gate
voltage (VG); clearly demonstrating that this gNDI-Br2 is an n-
type channel material. The device is normally OFF at VG =
0 and turns ON when a VG higher than the threshold voltage (VT)
is applied. As seen from the transfer curve, ID increases as the VG
increases; therefore, this gNDI-Br2-based OECT works as an
accumulation mode device. Increased VG causes the reduction
of the gNDI-Br2 active channel, and the metal ions from the

rial's electron balance.46
Fig. 5(d) shows the transfer curve and the corresponding
transconductance (gm) curve for the 50 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2
OECT. For the OECT we obtain a maximum drain current
(ID,max) of 44.6 mA with a transconductance (gm) of 344 ± 19.7 mS,
and the ON/OFF (ION/OFF) ratio of ∼101. Normalized trans-
conductance (gm,norm) calculated from the gm and channel
dimensions is 0.024 ± 0.003 S cm−1. The material gure of
merit, mC* product, was calculated using eqn (3) with the device
geometry and the VT of 172.5 mV (Fig. S10†).22

where ID is the drain current (mA), VG is the gate voltage (V). W is
the width (mm), L is the length (mm), and d (mm) is the thickness
of the OECT channel. m is the electronic carrier mobility (cm2
V−1 s−1), C* is the capacitance of the active channel material per

At the maximum gm, mC* was calculated as 0.13 ± 0.03
F cm−1 V−1 s−1. This value is not as high as the mC* of C60-TEG
(∼7.0 F cm−1 V−1 s−1),21 but similar to the other NDI-based
polymeric OMIECs channel materials, p(C3-gNDI-gT2) (0.13

With this mC* gure of merit and the capacitance value from the
EIS result, the electron mobility of gNDI-Br2 can be extracted.

mobility of BBL, which is 7.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.19
Two diﬀerent W/L devices were fabricated with channel
length of 10 and 20 mm using the synthesized gNDI-Br2. Fig. 5(c)
and (d) and S11† show the output characteristics, transfer and
transconductance curve for these devices. The average trans-
conductance (gm) values are 344 ± 19.7 and 149.1 ± 25.4 mS for
each L = 10 and L = 20 mm device. Both the devices have the
same channel thickness (d) and mC*. The device current and the
transconductance obtained from these devices are in accor-
dance of their W/L ratios of 108.1 and 43.5 for L = 10 and L = 20
mm, respectively.50,51 Fig. 5(e) and (f) show 100 mg mL−1 gNDI-
Br2 OECT IV characteristics. This device fabricated with higher
concentrations of gNDI-Br2 solution and the W/L ratio is 130.1
with length (L) of 10 mm. Compared to the 50 mg mL−1 device,
the increased concentrations of gNDI-Br2 shows maximum
transconductance (gm) of 814 ± 124.2 mS and mobility capaci-
tance product (mC*) of 0.23 ± 0.04 F cm−1 V−1 s−1, respectively.
The additional amount of gNDI-Br2 molecules enhances device
transconductance and mobility capacitance product by creating
a denser thin lm. As the material conducts via hopping, denser
lms lead to higher transconductance.
For biosensing applications, the device needs to operate stably
in aqueous environment. The gNDI-Br2 OECTs consistently
demonstrated similar output and transfer characteristics over 5
measurements (ID,max 54.1 ± 8.5 mA at VD = 0.8 V and VG = 0.4 V
with 50 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2). In addition, the repeated cycling
measurements of this OECT device (Fig. S12†) were performed
gate potential between 0 and 0.5 V in the constant bias (VD =
0.5 V, pulse length = 30 s) over 36 minutes. We observe 22.3%
drain current reduction aer 36 minutes. But it can be observed
that the reduction aer 800 s the reduction in the drain current is
only 5.65% till the end of measurement. We think that some of
the cations are trapped in the material permanently aer the
initial testing and this leads to a reduction in the device current.
Single-pulse from the repeated cycling measurements is shown
in Fig. S12(c).† The NDI active channel requires a longer ON pulse
time to reach the saturated ID regime as compared to the other n-
type OMIEC material. Due to the larger thickness of the gNDI-Br2
lm, the ionic charges, such as metal ions, take extra time to
penetrate through the lm. Hence, it requires more time to dope
the material volumetrically.
Table 2 summarizes the relevant results from literature
related to NDI-based polymeric and small molecule OMIECs and
the fabricated OECT performance. A few research studies have
been published for the n-type OMIECs, but this is the rst re-
ported NDI-based small molecule channel material for OECT.
Compared to other n-type OMIECs, gNDI-Br2 with glycol side
chains shows similar mC* value than p(C8-T2)24 and p(C3-gNDI-
gT2),49 which was based on gNDI-Br2 monomer. The synthesis
procedure we have used is relatively more straightforward and
less toxic as compared to the other polymeric OMIECs because it
operates without a transition-metal catalyst. However, the gNDI-
Br2 shows a lower gm,norm than other NDI-based polymeric
materials, even with a lessened gure of merit products. Feng
et al.25 have published new fused bithiophene imide-based n-type
OMIECs, f-BTI2TEG-T and f-BTI2TEG-FT. Between the two fused

BTI OMIECs, f-BTI2TEG-FT demonstrates the highest normalized
transconductance (gm,norm) and mobility capacitance product
(mC*) values, 4.6 S cm−1 and 15.2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for f-BTI2TEG-
FT, among the other reported n-type OECT channel materials.
This material shows enhanced transconductance and mC* due to
the strong water uptake and ion transport. To obtain better OECT
performance and stability with this n-type small molecule
OMIEC, diﬀerent device congurations or the channel fabrica-
tion method will be tried in the future. In addition to this,
diﬀerent glycol side-chain structures or other core structures
such as thiophene fused NDI can be adapted to improve the peak
performance of NDI small molecules. With the demonstrated n-
type small molecule, the accumulation mode complementary
OECT device for inverters can be fabricated.11 These devices can
be utilised for both sensing and signal processing applications
for exible electronics and biosensors.
Conclusions
Here, we report the development of novel n-type naphthalene
diimide (NDI)-based small-molecule organic mixed ionic and
electronic conduction for application in organic electrochemical
transistors (OECTs). We have investigated the promising features
of gNDI-Br2 small molecule mixed conductor as the channel
material for n-type accumulation mode OECTs. The synthesized
material demonstrates high electron aﬃnity (4.12 eV), resulting
in its excellent stability in the ambient atmosphere. The material
demonstrates the feasibility of bulk doping and high volumetric
capacitance of 203.2 F cm−3 from spectroelectrochemical
measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In
addition, the GIWAXS pattern indicates that the gNDI-Br2 is
irregularly deposited onto the substrate. The sharp lamellar-like
scattering peaks in both qz and qr line cuts conrms the
random accumulation of the material. The weak reections in
the qz direction represent the p–p stacking to the gNDI-Br2,
which does not appear along with qr. The gNDI-Br2 can be
applied for the bridging channel for the accumulation mode
OECT via drop-casting as it is solution processable. The gNDI-Br2
fabricated OECT with 50 mg mL−1, demonstrates a maximum
transconductance and material gure of merit values, 344 ± 19.7
mS and 0.13 ± 0.03 F cm−1 V−1 s−1, respectively. For devices
fabricated using 100 mg mL−1 gNDI-Br2 we observe an enhanced
gm,max of 814 ± 124.23 mS and mC* of 0.23 ± 0.04 F cm−1 V−1 s−1.
36 minutes testing of the device indicates good stability with
minor degradation of 5.7% of drain current aer 13 minutes.
These results indicate that gNDI-Br2 is an stable OMIEC material
and an excellent candidate for accumulation type OECTs. Thus,
the gNDI-Br2 can be used to fabricate the complementary circuits
which can be used for biosensing applications and also for signal
processing for biosensors. As gNDI-Br2 is solution processable it
can be drop casted or 3D printed enabling its use in large scale
device fabrication.
