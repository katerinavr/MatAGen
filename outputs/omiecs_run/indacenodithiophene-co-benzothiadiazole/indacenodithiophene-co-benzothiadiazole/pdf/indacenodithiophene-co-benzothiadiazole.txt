Organic semiconductors are increasingly being decorated with hydrophilic solubilising chains to create
materials that can function as mixed ionic–electronic conductors, which are promising candidates for inter-
facing biological systems with organic electronics. While numerous organic semiconductors, including p-
and n-type materials, small molecules and polymers, have been successfully tailored to encompass mixed
conduction properties, common to all these systems is that they have been semicrystalline materials. Here,
we explore how side chain engineering in the nano-crystalline indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole
(IDTBT) polymer can be used to instil ionic transport properties and how this in turn influences the
electronic transport properties. This allows us to ultimately assess the mixed ionic–electronic transport prop-
erties of these new IDTBT polymers using the organic electrochemical transistor as the testing platform.
Using a complementary experimental and computational approach, we find that polar IDTBT derivatives can
be infiltrated by water and solvated ions, they can be electrochemically doped efficiently in aqueous electro-
lyte with fast doping kinetics, and upon aqueous swelling there is no deterioration of the close interchain
contacts that are vital for efficient charge transport in the IDTBT system. Despite these promising attributes,
mixed ionic–electronic charge transport properties are surprisingly poor in all the polar IDTBT derivatives.
Albeit a ‘‘negative’’ result, this finding clearly contradicts established side chain engineering rules for mixed
ionic–electronic conductors, which motivated our continued investigation of this system. We eventually find
this anomalous behaviour to be caused by increasing energetic disorder in the polymers with increasing
polar side chain content. We have investigated computationally how the polar side chain motifs contribute
to this detrimental energetic inhomogeneity and ultimately use the learnings to propose new molecular
design criteria for side chains that can facilitate ion transport without impeding electronic transport.

Introduction
A rapidly growing interest in the field of organic bioelectronics
with emerging applications such as bioelectronic sensors and
neuromorphic devices has spurred significant attention to the
concept of mixed ionic and electronic conduction that merges
the language of biology (ionic charges) with that of electronics
(electronic charges).1–3 Engineering of organic mixed ionic–
electronic conductors (OMIECs) can be approached through
rational materials choice, for instance by mixing an electrically
conducting polymer with an ionomer as seen in the case of
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate.4–6
Chemical engineering offers another approach whereby organic
semiconductors can be structurally modified, typically with
hydrophilic or ionic moieties, to afford mixed ionic–electronic
properties within a single active material.7–10 While both
approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, a greater
selection of OMIECs with varied properties is needed to facil-
itate the continued growth of organic bioelectronics.
Taking advantage of the vast knowledge generated during
the last few decades of organic electronics research, many high-
performing organic charge-transport materials have successfully
been chemically modified to encompass mixed ionic–electronic
transport properties. This includes for instance hole-transporting
(p-type) thiophene-based small-molecule and polymeric semicon-
ductors as well as electron-transporting (n-type) rylene diimide-
based materials chemically modified with e.g., oligoether chains,
hydroxyl- or sulfonate-terminated alkyl chains.8–12 Donor–accep-
tor-type structures, benefiting from strong intramolecular inter-
actions between alternating electron-rich and -deficient units to
modulate the frontier energy levels, have likewise been syntheti-
cally modified to ensure ionic transport in the bulk semiconductor
film as exemplified by recent studies of diketopyrrolopyrrole- and
isoindigo-based polymers functionalised with oligoether side
chains.13–17 A common theme emerging from these studies across
different classes of organic semiconductors is that a good electro-
nic charge transport material can be turned into a good mixed
ionic–electronic charge transport material simply by replacing
the non-polar solubilising substituents with polar alternatives.
Among the plethora of donor–acceptor materials from the organic
electronics literature, the indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole
(IDTBT) polymer has often been highlighted due to a reliably high
hole mobility above 1 cm2 V1 s1 with near-ideal field-effect
transistor characteristics despite a lack of long-range crystalline
order.18–20 The highly efficient charge transport in the solid state is
attributed to a torsion-resilient backbone conformation leading to a
low degree of energetic disorder and fast intrachain charge trans-
port with only a few interchain contacts needed for efficient long-
range transport.21 As such, IDTBT appears as a promising polymer
backbone for OMIECs materials development and an obvious
platform for side chain engineering studies.
With these considerations in mind, we have systematically
substituted fractions of the usual n-hexadecyl (C16) solubilising
side chains of IDTBT-C16 with more polar ethylene glycol-
containing side chains to study the impact on ionic and
electronic charge transport properties. More precisely, the
introduced amphipathic side chains comprise an initial non-
polar five-carbon spacer unit separating the polymer backbone
from a polar methyl-terminated triethylene glycol unit to keep
the side chain length identical to the original C16 chain.
Employing a statistical (random) copolymerisation protocol,
10%, 50% and 100% of the C16-bearing indacenodithiophene
units have been substituted for the corresponding indaceno-
dithiophene motifs with amphipathic side chains. Undertaking a
joint experimental and computational approach, we have subse-
quently studied in detail how the resulting polymers interact with
solvated ions, how they conduct electronic charges and how they
respond to electrochemical and chemical doping. To our surprise,
we have found that IDTBT does not conform to the established
side chain engineering rules; it does not readily function as a
mixed ionic–electronic conductor upon the introduction of polar
oligoether side chains. Finally, we have used the accumulated
understanding of this system to refine our current comprehen-
sion of side chain engineering and propose new side chain design
criteria for optimising mixed ionic–electronic conduction proper-
ties in near-amorphous semiconducting polymers.
Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis and characterisation
The IDTBT copolymer series presented in Fig. 1a, comprising
diﬀerent ratios of the glycolated IDT monomer containing
2,5,8,11-tetraoxahexadecane side chains and the commonly
used hexadecyl substituted IDT monomer, was synthesised
via Suzuki–Miyaura polymerisation by adapting the reported
literature procedure.18 The well-known IDTBT-C16 (denoted
IDTBT-P0 herein) was synthesised as a reference material to
thereafter proceed with co-polymerisations using 10%, 50%
and 100% loading of the polar IDT monomer to afford poly-
mers IDTBT-P10, IDTBT-P50 and IDTBT-P100.22 Detailed con-
ditions of monomer and polymer synthesis are described in the
ESI.† 1H NMR analysis (Fig. 1b and Section S1, ESI†) confirmed
that the ratios between glycolated and alkylated IDT moieties in
the mixed copolymers were close to the expected based on
monomer feed ratios; polar content of 11% and 51%, respec-
tively, was found for IDTBT-P10 and IDTBT-P50. The number
average molecular weight (Mn) and dispersities (PDI) of the
polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography.
Non-polar IDTBT-P0 displayed the highest molecular weight
(Mn = 58 kDa, PDI = 1.2), meanwhile IDTBT-P10 (Mn = 48 kDa,
PDI = 1.2) and IDTBT-P50 (Mn = 48 kDa, PDI = 1.3) presented
comparable values, however IDTBT-P100 (Mn = 18 kDa,
PDI = 1.8) showed a considerably lower degree of polymeri-
sation indicating that the 100% loading of the polar IDT
monomer negatively affected the chain growth of the polymer.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy of polymer thin films spin-
cast from o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) onto glass substrates is
presented in Fig. 1c. It can be observed that IDTBT-P10 and
IDTBT-P50 share a maximum absorption peak with IDTBT-P0
at 678 nm, with a slight increase in the shoulder at 624 nm with
increasing polar content. The main absorption feature of

IDTBT-P100 is blue-shifted by 14 nm relative to the other
polymers with a slightly broader shape; this might be attributed
to the somewhat lower degree of polymerisation and a more
disordered morphology. The higher energy absorption feature
observed for all the polymers around 400 nm is attributed to
the p–p* transitions.
Contact angle measurements were performed to better
understand the polarity and wettability of the polymer thin
film surfaces. IDTBT-P0 presented a contact angle of 851  0.3
with water and the introduction of 10% of the polar monomer
led to a lower contact angle (741  0.2), this eﬀect is stronger
with 50% incorporation of the polar monomer (611  0.6), but
no further decrement of the contact angle is observed for the
fully glycolated polymer (IDTBT-P100, 631  0.3, Fig. S1, ESI†).
The polymers thus showed increased hydrophilicity and wett-
ability with increasing polar content with a limit close to 601 in
contact angle with water.
The surface work function of each polymer was investigated
using the Kelvin probe technique. Thin films were spin-cast
from ODCB solutions onto silicon substrates. It was found that
the surface work function of the polymer films decreased with
increasing polar content. IDTBT-P0, P10, P50 and P100 aﬀorded
work functions of 4.98 eV, 4.95 eV, 4.88 eV, and 4.70 eV,
respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). Although the work function depends
on several factors like the orientation of the polymer near the
surface, the exposure to ambient conditions and residual
solvent, the trend reflects the increasing content of electron-
donating oligoether chains when going from IDTBT-P0 to
IDTBT-P100. The work function values are moreover close to
that reported for polycrystalline gold under ambient conditions
(B5.1 eV),23 which could potentially lead to low contact resis-
tance when using gold contacts in electrical measurements.24
Cyclic voltammetry measurements on polymer thin films
spin-cast from ODCB were conducted with tetrabutylammo-
nium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte in acetonitrile at various
scan rates (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The onset of oxidation was found
to decrease with increasing polar content in agreement with the
Kelvin probe data reflecting the more facile ion penetration
into the polymer films with increasing polar content.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was
performed to investigate the structural properties of the poly-
mer thin films (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4, ESI†). A predominant face-on
orientation of the polymer backbone relative to the substrate is
observed; fittings of the in-plane peaks at low q-values and the
out-of-plane peaks at higher q-values aﬀord along-chain repeat
distances in the range 15.5–15.7 Å and p-stacking distances
from 4.15 to 4.35 Å across the polymer series. IDTBT-P100 is
significantly more amorphous than the other three IDTBT
polymers who show similar along-chain coherence lengths in
the range 97–114 Å and a slight decrease of the second order
(002) along-chain peak when going from IDTBT-P0 to IDTBT-
P10 and IDTBT-P50; IDTBT-P100, on the other hand, shows no
discernible (00l) along-chain peaks in the in-plane direction.
Longer p-stacking distances (4.34–4.35 Å) for IDTBT-P10 and
IDTBT-P50 than for IDTBT-P0 and IDTBT-P100 (4.29 Å and 4.15 Å,
respectively) suggest that the mixed copolymer design with polar
and non-polar side chains randomly distributed along the poly-
mer backbone leads to less favourable polymer backbone inter-
actions than seen for the two polymers decorated entirely with
polar or non-polar side chains.

Mixed ionic–electronic transport properties
Following the characterisation of the IDTBT copolymers, we
investigated the mixed ionic–electronic transport properties to
validate our molecular design strategy. To this end, the organic
electrochemical transistor (OECT) is an ideal platform due to
the three-electrode configuration with electrochemical gating
facilitated by an electrolyte solution directly in contact with the
active layer. This allows for ions to infiltrate the semiconductor
film and compensate the electronic charges that can be injected
into (or extracted from) the bulk semiconductor layer via the
source and drain electrodes. The OECT performance of the four
polymers was evaluated using both aqueous and non-aqueous
electrolytes. For the aqueous system, OECTs were measured with
a 0.1 M NaCl electrolyte, however, none of the four IDTBT
polymers showed typical output and transfer characteristics when
biased between 0 and 0.7 V (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5, ESI†). To explore
a larger electrochemical window, non-aqueous OECTs were tested
with 0.1 M LiOTf and 0.1 M NaClO4 in acetonitrile and biased up
to 2.0 V during the gate sweep (Fig. 3c, g and Fig. S6, ESI†).
To mimic the conditions where we see efficient electrochemical
doping (vide infra), non-aqueous OECTs were also tested with
0.1 M TBAPF6 in acetonitrile (Fig. S9, ESI†). Finally, OECTs
were tested with the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][TFSI], Fig. S7 and S8,
ESI†). None of the polymers showed typical output and transfer
characteristics when tested in acetonitrile irrespective of choice of
electrolyte. Only with the [EMIM][TFSI] ionic liquid electrolyte,
small current responses (o 1 mA) were observed for IDTBT-P10
and IDTBT-P50 (Fig. 3d and h) although meaningful figures-of-
merit could not be extracted. These surprising results on the
mixed ionic–electronic transport led us to interrogate in greater
detail both the ionic transport and the electronic transport
properties to elucidate the underlying reasons for the lack of
efficient mixed transport in this polymer system.
Ionic transport and electrochemical doping
An electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (eQCM) was
used to investigate the static swelling properties of the four
polymers in water. IDTBT-P0, IDTBT-P10, IDTBT-P50, and
IDTBT-P100 swell 0%, 2%, 9% and 12% respectively (Table S1
and Fig. S10, ESI†). Without the polar side chains, the IDTBT-
P0 thin film does not absorb any aqueous electrolyte within the
detection limit of the eQCM technique. As the polar side chain
content increases, the degree of swelling grows gradually up to
12% for IDTBT-P100. This trend indicates that the introduction of
glycolated side chains enhances the hydrophilicity of the IDTBT
polymers, which is consistent with the molecular design and the
contact angle and cyclic voltammetry data discussed above.
The dispersion of water molecules (and associated ions) was
further investigated from a computational perspective using
classical force-field molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations focusing on the extreme cases of
IDTBT-P0 and IDTBT-P100. To proceed with this, we first
benchmarked our force field by constructing the most stable
supramolecular organizations of dry IDTBT-P025 and IDTBT-
P100 films (see Section S8, ESI†). Stable crystal arrangements
for both polymers (Fig. S11, ESI†) correspond to a cofacial
arrangement of two inequivalent polymer chains. In both cases,

the side chains are interdigitated between the successive layers
of p-stacked chains. Lattice parameters compare favourably
with experimental data available from earlier investigations
for IDTBT-P0 and with the results of the GIWAXS measure-
ments reported here.21,26 The impact on the resulting morphol-
ogy of the presence of water molecules inside the IDTBT co-
polymer amorphous films was subsequently estimated by mix-
ing 20 hexamers of IDTBT-P0 or IDTBT-P100 with 5 wt% (442
molecules) and 25 wt% (2210 molecules) of water. We obtained
very diﬀerent results for IDTBT-P0 versus IDTBT-P100. In the
case of the P0 polymer chains, carrying apolar side chains, all
water molecules aggregate as bubbles when inserted into the
films, while the water molecules get fully dispersed during the
MD simulations of the P100 films (see Fig. 4a and b). At this
point, and very much in line with chemical intuition, we can
thus deliberately disregard P0 as a possible candidate for OECT
applications, because of the very poor uptake of water.
To mimic the working principle of an OECT, a system made
of 20 hexamers of IDTBT-P100, 25 wt% of water and 60 chlorine
anions was studied next. Here, to ensure the electroneutrality of
the system, 60 positive charges have been added uniformly on
the conjugated atoms of P100. The morphology of this system is
represented in Fig. 4c and reveals that: (i) the water molecules
are still reasonably well dispersed throughout the films, though
not as uniformly as in the water-only case; and (ii) that the
chlorine atoms are preferentially located in water-rich regions.
To analyse the relative position of the chlorine atoms in the
film, radial distribution functions (RDF) and coordination
numbers have been calculated on the 10 snapshots of the MD
trajectory (Fig. 4d–g). Not surprisingly, the RDF curves suggest a
strong interaction between the chlorine ions and the water
molecules (mostly with the hydrogen atoms). With a coordina-
tion number of five, our RDF analysis suggests that chlorine
anions are, on average, solvated by five water molecules (Fig. 4d
and e). Chlorine atoms are also interacting with the polar side
chains since the calculated coordination numbers between the
chlorine anions and either the carbons or oxygens of the polar
side chains is two (Fig. 4f and g). Chlorine anions are in
contrast less likely to interact with the conjugated backbones,
the coordination numbers being small for all conjugated atoms
(see Table S2, ESI†). This should also have a positive impact on
charge transport, as trapping of the majority hole carriers by
chlorine anions should be limited.
With confirmation that water molecules (and associated
ions) can infiltrate the polar IDTBT derivatives, we next turned
our attention to the electrochemical doping process using
in situ time-resolved Vis-NIR spectroelectrochemistry. Spectro-
electrochemical experiments were carried out, using 0.1 M
TBAPF6 in acetonitrile as electrolyte and an Ag/AgCl counter
electrode and thin films of B25 and B200 nm deposited via
spin coating onto ITO substrates. A home-built setup was used,
where polychromatic light is transmitted through the sample
and simultaneously detected with two spectrophotometers in
the visible and near-infrared range. Square pulses of voltage
ranging from 0.1 to 1.3 V with 0.1 V steps were applied for
5 s. Each doping step was followed by a subsequent dedoping
step for 5 s at 0 V. In Fig. 5a, the absorbance spectra for diﬀerent
voltages of IDTBT-P50 (28 nm) are displayed. The spectra for the
other IDTBT polymers are included in the ESI† (Fig. S13). From
0.1 to 0.8 V, one main band at around 670 nm is present,
which is ascribed to the absorption of the neutral polymer. At
higher doping voltages, a second band at around 1020 nm and a
third band at around 1450 nm appear. Those are attributed to
polarons and bipolarons, respectively.26,27
To decompose the absorption spectra into the diﬀerent
species and their respective concentrations, we used multi-
variate curve resolution (MCR) analysis. The spectral compo-
nents for the B25 nm thick films are shown in Fig. 5b (Fig. S14
for all films, ESI†). The shape of the neutral polymer absor-
bance around 670 nm was adapted to account for the spectral

changes between the materials shown in Fig. 1b) (notably,
IDTBT-P100 has a broader and more unstructured signature).
The polaron component centred around 1020 nm is also
broader for IDTBT-P100, while a similar spectrum could be
used for the other films, and a comparable bipolaron compo-
nent around 1450 nm was found in all cases. From the MCR
analysis, the evolution of the species as a function of voltage is
extracted and compared for IDTBT-P50 (28 nm) and IDTBT-P0
(21 nm) in Fig. 5c). The plots of the other polymers are included
in Fig. S15 and S16 (ESI†). In agreement with the cyclic
voltammetry and Kelvin probe data, the onset of the oxidation
of the neutral species to polarons decreases from about 0.8 V
to 0.6 V with increasing polar content, and the formation of
bipolarons shifts from 0.9 V to 0.8 V. The neutral species are
depleted until 1.1 V in all films and the polaron concentration
decreases at high oxidation voltages, as polarons are converted
to a rising population of bipolarons. We also recorded the
current of the devices by chronoamperometry and deduced the
injected or extracted charge carrier density during the doping
and dedoping processes (Fig. S17 and S18, ESI†). The onsets
and trends with voltage closely follow the spectroelectrochem-
ical changes in the diﬀerent materials.
The dynamics of the doping processes in the IDTBT poly-
mers was investigated using time-resolved spectroelectrochem-
istry with a resolution of 10 ms. The MCR components from the
steady-state spectra were used to obtain the temporal evolution
of the neutral, polaron and bipolaron species as shown for
IDTBT-P50 (28 nm) in Fig. 5d). The bi-exponential dynamics
show a fast decay of the neutral species together with a fast rise
of polarons and slightly slower rise of bipolarons at a doping
voltage of 0.9 V. The conversion speeds up with higher voltage
because the driving force increases at a higher overpotential
with respect to the doping onset (Fig. S19, ESI†). To compare
the diﬀerent materials, two voltages were chosen for each (1.0
and 1.3 V for IDTBT-P0 and P10, 0.9 and 1.2 V for IDTBT-
P50 and 0.8 and 1.1 V for IDTBT-P100), taking into account
the diﬀerent oxidation onsets. As the ion transport is hypothe-
sized to be better for the more polar polymers, the kinetics is

expected to vary for the IDTBT-P0 to P100 materials. This eﬀect
will also be impacted by the film thickness, since in our device
configuration, the ions must penetrate vertically through the
film to compensate the holes injected at the underlying ITO
electrode. We hypothesise that ions penetrate through thinner
films faster, until a limit is reached where the electrochemical
reaction is slower than the ion penetration and the kinetics
depend
less
on
film
thickness
(Fig.
S20,
ESI†).
Single-
wavelength dynamics were used to display the dependence of
the oxidation reaction rate on the applied voltage and the
thickness (Fig. S21 and Table S3, ESI†). Dynamics for 5–6
thicknesses ranging from around 8 to 200 nm for each IDTBT
polymer were analysed, so that a clear sub-linear relation
between doping/dedoping rate with the thickness can be
observed. The precise thickness-dependent transport will be
subject to a further study. For moving-front experiments over
micrometre lateral film distances, it has been shown to occur
by complex drift-diffusion
mechanisms
that include the
applied potential and quasi-electric fields generated by charges
in the film.28
For the present study, we simply compare thinner films of
B25 nm (close to the electrochemical limit) to thicker films of
B200 nm (strong dependence on ionic transport) for the
diﬀerent polymers. All doping and dedoping dynamics are
shown in Fig. S22 and S23 (ESI†). The data were analysed by
MCR, and the kinetics were quantified by the time to reach 1/e
of the final population (interpolating between two points close
to 1/e) and are summarized in Table 1 and Table S4 (ESI†). In
Fig. 5e the temporal evolution of the neutral species is com-
pared between the diﬀerent IDTBT polymers for the two film
thicknesses at the lower (0.8 to 1.0 V) doping level. In the
thinner films, IDTBT-P0 dopes the slowest with a time of
0.682 s to deplete 1/e of the neutral population, followed by
IDTBT-P10 (0.336 s). This time decreases by more than half for

the polar IDTBT-P50 and IDTBT-P100 polymers (0.138–0.187 s),
which have very similar dynamics. Those polar polymers are
close to the electrochemical limit, and the dynamics mainly
correspond to the charge injection into the IDTBT backbone at
a given overpotential (Fig. S20, ESI†). For the less polar deriva-
tives with less favourable ionic transport, thinner films
(B8 nm) are necessary to reach the electrochemical limit, so
that the dynamics in the B25 nm films are still limited by ion
transport and therefore slower. The same trend is seen for the
1/e rise of the polarons and bipolarons, which slows down from
0.145 s to 0.624 s (polarons) and from 0.309 s to 0.759 s
(bipolarons) with decreasing polarity (Fig. S22, ESI†). In the
thicker films, the doping process is overall slower by a factor of
1.5–2 compared to the thin films (Fig. S22 and Table 1, ESI†),
because of the higher impact of ionic transport. The effect is
enhanced for the non-polar films, so that the difference
between the materials becomes accentuated (Fig. 5e). At the
higher doping level (1.1 to 1.3 V), all the doping dynamics
are faster, and a similar increase of doping rate with polar side
chain content is seen, especially for the thicker films (Fig. S23,
ESI†). The dynamics were also investigated for the dedoping
processes. A faster kinetic behaviour is observed during the
dedoping of all polymers compared to the doping. However, the
polar polymers again respond significantly faster than IDTBT-
P0 even in the thin films (Fig. 5f), showing that poor ionic
transport also limits the dedoping rate. These results extracted
from the dynamics of the MCR agree with the findings from the
single-wavelength dynamics (Fig. S21, ESI†) and are very repro-
ducible (Fig. S24 and Table S5, ESI†).
Electronic transport and chemical doping
Having confirmed, both experimentally and computationally,
that the IDTBT derivatives with polar side chain motifs indeed
do facilitate ion movement in and out of the bulk polymer film,
we next investigated the electronic transport properties of the
system. As mentioned above, the charge transport of IDTBT is
governed by fast intrachain transport and a limited number of
close interchain contacts that allow for charge hopping across
polymer chains. With this in mind, we first investigated in silico
the eﬀect of polar side chains and water and ion uptake on the
number and quality of interchain contacts in IDTBT.
The analysis of the spatial contacts between polymer chains
in the simulated morphologies of pure IDTBT-P0 and IDTBT-
P100 without water or ions, as quantified in Fig. S12 and
Table 2 (ESI†), suggests a larger number of connecting path-
ways for charge hopping in IDTBT-P100 compared to IDTBT-P0.
This result is corroborated by the calculated distribution of
hole couplings.29,30 Our density functional theory (DFT) calcu-
lations indeed reveal that, among all close contacts, the fraction
that yields transfer integrals in excess of 1 meV is 37% in
IDTBT-P100, compared to only 31% in IDTBT-P0 (Table 2). The
diﬀerence is even more pronounced for strongly electronically
coupled chromophores (transfer integrals in excess of 10 meV),
which amount to 9% in IDTBT-P100 compared to 5% in IDTBT-
P0. Based on the analysis of the density and quality of the close
contacts between the polymer chains, substituting the apolar
side chains of the original IDTBT copolymer by more flexible
polar side chains is thus not expected to alter the outstanding
charge transport properties of the original IDTBT copolymer,
quite the opposite. Moving on from the pure polymer films, we
consider next the swollen systems more relevant for OECT
device operation. In the case of IDTBT-P100 subjected to 5%
and 25% water uptake, we find that the higher the water intake
the smaller the density of intermolecular electronic contacts,
though the eﬀect is rather modest (except for the most strongly
interacting pairs), see Table 2. This decrease in electronic
connectivity is driven by the swelling of the polymer film in
the presence of water. Furthermore, the simultaneous presence
of water and anions in the film does not alter the connectivity
between the monomeric units (Table 2, last entry). Although the
total number of contacts is slightly reduced compared to pure
IDTBT-P100 films (111 versus 124), the quality of the strongest
electronic contacts is similar to what was found for pure P100
(11% versus 9% of contacts with hole couplings larger than
10 meV). This suggests that, from an electronic connectivity
point of view, the intrinsic charge transport properties of pure
IDTBT-P100 should be preserved in OECT devices.
In contrast to the encouraging computational results on the
electronic properties of the polar IDTBT derivatives, experi-
mental data suggests otherwise. First, we fabricated organic
field-eﬀect transistors (OFETs) to evaluate the charge carrier
mobilities across the IDTBT series (Fig. S25, S26 and Table 3,
ESI†). A saturation hole mobility of 0.95 cm2 V1 s1 was
found
for
IDTBT-P0
in
good
agreement
with
previous
studies.18 Nevertheless, introduction of polar side chains
aﬀorded a rapid decline in the transport properties with the
hole mobility decreasing steeply to 0.34 cm2 V1 s1 and 7.8 
103 cm2 V1 s1 for IDTBT-P10 and IDTBT-P50, respectively,
while no current modulation could be observed for the IDTBT-
P100 device. Such trends have been observed previously for
other p- and n-type semiconducting polymers.22,31 To investi-
gate if residual water in the more polar IDTBT films played a

role in the poor device performance, we also fabricated OFETs with
a molecular additive (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodi-
methane,
F4TCNQ).32,33
No
improvement
in
device
per-
formance was observed with the F4TCNQ additive (Fig. S27, ESI†)
indicating that residual water is not responsible for the decline in
charge carrier mobility with increasing polar content or that the
adverse eﬀect of residual water cannot be avoided by the incorpora-
tion of molecular additives as it can for the IDTBT-P0 polymer.
Subsequently, IDTBT films spin-cast onto glass substrates
were chemically doped using the strong oxidant tris(4-bromo-
phenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (Magic Blue) to
investigate
their
electrical
conductivity
using
four-point
probe measurements. The polymers were doped sequentially
using two diﬀerent dopant concentrations, 0.25 mg mL1 and
0.5 mg mL1 of Magic Blue in acetonitrile, to achieve diﬀerent
doping levels (Fig. S28, ESI†). Again, a rapid decline in electrical
performance was observed with increasing polar content
(Table 3). At low doping levels, a more than 100-fold decrease
in conductivity was seen when going from IDTBT-P0 to IDTBT-
P50 in line with the OFET data. The conductivity is generally
higher at the higher doping level (0.5 mg mL1) with the trend of
decreasing conductivity with increasing polar content similar,
although the drop in conductivity is smaller (4.49 S cm1 versus
0.93 S cm1 for IDTBT-P0 and IDTBT-P50, respectively). For both
doping levels, no current could be detected for IDTBT-P100 with
the used technique in good agreement with the transistor data.
Although the relatively low molecular weight of IDTBT-P100
could be a contributing factor to the low OFET mobility and
the low conductivity upon doping, the three other IDTBT deri-
vatives are of comparable molecular weight confirming that the
observed charge transport trends are unlikely to be dominated
by molecular weight eﬀects.
With the computational modelling suggesting little or no
negative eﬀect on the number and quality of interchain
contacts upon the introduction of polar side chains onto
IDTBT, increasing energetic disorder was considered as an
alternative explanation for the deterioration of charge transport
properties that we observe experimentally with increasing polar
side chain content.34 In order to test this hypothesis, we
theoretically assessed the electrostatic energetic disorder in
IDTBT-P100 (both dry and wet) versus IDTBT-P0, in both
amorphous and crystalline morphologies of the polymers. As
a proxy for the energetic disorder, we computed the standard
deviation on the total energy of the films when adding one
excess positive charge on successively each single monomer
unit of each polymer chain. Table 4 shows that, in their
respective amorphous phases, the standard deviation calcu-
lated in dry IDTBT-P100 is about three times as large as that in
IDTBT-P0 (113 meV versus 43 meV). Interestingly, the presence
of water in amorphous IDTBT-P100 does not lead to a further
increase of the energetic disorder. Since IDTBT-P0 and IDTBT-
P100 both exhibit a near-amorphous character and conforma-
tional disorder resilient energetic disorder, the main culprit for
the increased energetic inhomogeneity in IDTBT-P100 is the
varying electrostatic potential induced on the conjugated back-
bones by the polar side chains, as indeed confirmed by a
detailed analysis of the various contributions to the total
potential energy. In hypothetical crystalline morphologies, we
expect the electrostatic potential to be more homogeneous and
hence the energetic disorder to be smaller. This is, indeed,
what is predicted by the calculations, see Table 4. We note,
however, that even in the crystalline phase, where the side
chains are kept away from their conjugated cores due to the
interdigitated lamellar organisation, there is a residual ener-
getic inhomogeneity with a similar trend of increased energetic
disorder in the polar system. This is because of the combined
eﬀects of thermal motion and the fact that holes sitting on one
lamellar layer still feel the electrostatic eﬀects associated with

As a matter of fact, the distance between the last carbon of the
side chains and the closest conjugated atom of the next
lamellar layer is only B2.5 Å.
Photothermal deflection spectroscopy was subsequently per-
formed on the polymer series to investigate experimentally the
energetic disorder in the system (Fig. S29, ESI†). Urbach energy
values of 29.8 meV, 30.8 meV, 32.0 meV, and 43 meV for IDTBT-
P0, P10, P50 and P100, respectively, confirmed the increasing
energetic disorder with increasing polar content; a significantly
higher energetic disorder for IDTBT-P100 is in qualitative
agreement with the predictions from the computational mod-
elling. We note that the lower molecular weight and higher
polydispersity of IDTBT-P100 could also contribute to the
higher Urbach energy.
Conclusion and outlook
Indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole, a high-performing elec-
tronic charge transport material, was synthetically modified with
amphipathic side chains comprising an apolar five-methylene
spacer and a polar terminal oligoether group to impart mixed
ionic–electronic transport properties. A series of polymers was
prepared with varying polar content and studied extensively using
a suite of experimental and computational techniques. Expectedly,
we saw increasing water uptake and faster ion kinetics in the
polymer films with increasing polar content. This was firmly
established using time-resolved spectroelectrochemistry on both
relatively thin and thick polymer films. Despite the successful
chemical engineering of ion-transport pathways in the polymer
films with higher polar content, mixed ionic–electronic properties
probed in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration were
lacking with negligible electrical current modulation observed for
the polar IDTBT polymers. The underlying lack of efficient electro-
nic charge transport in the polar polymer derivatives was ulti-
mately found to originate not from a deterioration of intrachain
contacts but from an increasing energetic inhomogeneity caused
by the oligoether segments of the side chains.
To better gauge the origin of the observed electrostatic
disorder in the polar IDTBT systems, we have performed
Gedanken numerical experiments where the partial atomic
charges of the oxygen atoms in the oligoether moiety have
been set to zero one after the other (Fig. 6a) while freezing all
nuclei. We find, in particular, that the amount of energetic
disorder is significantly reduced when the partial charges over
the last two oxygen atoms (O3 and O4 in Fig. 6a) are set to zero
as for apolar groups. Overall, our results suggest that the poor
performance of IDTBT-P100 in OECTs is likely because of the
poorly organised character of the film and the associated
additional source of disorder introduced by the polar side
chains. Increasing the degree of structural order in the polymer
films thus appears as an attractive strategy, especially if it can
be combined with the use of mixed (amphipathic) side chains
for water and ion intake where the polar moieties are properly

placed near the middle to maximize their separation from the
conjugated backbones from the same or adjacent layers
(Fig. 6b).
Considering why IDTBT behaves diﬀerently to other semi-
conducting polymers that have been structurally modified to
impart mixed ionic–electronic transport properties we believe it
is related to the microstructure and the mechanism of charge
transport. Because IDTBT has no pronounced, close p–p stack-
ing the electronic charge transport is particularly sensitive to
the presence of energetic disorder in the vicinity of the sites at
which interchain hopping occurs. The presence of polar side
chains, which are introduced in a random fashion along the
polymer chain due to the statistical polymerisation process and
have permanent dipoles and a different conformation com-
pared to linear alkyl chains, in the vicinity of the close inter-
chain
contacts
can
introduce
energetic
barriers
for
the
interchain hopping process that the electronic charge carrier
mobility is very sensitive to.
In conclusion, when considering the learning outcomes
from this study in the context of future molecular design
strategies, our experimental work and combined classical/
quantum simulations have shown that the performance of
OECT devices can be strongly altered by the presence of polar
side chains. Their interactions with the conjugated backbone
can lead to a dramatic increase of the energetic disorder.
However, two strategies can limit this increase: (i) the use of
semi-crystalline instead of near-amorphous organic semicon-
ductors and (ii) the judicious design of the polar side chains,
i.e., by incorporating the hydrophilic segment between two
apolar regions.
