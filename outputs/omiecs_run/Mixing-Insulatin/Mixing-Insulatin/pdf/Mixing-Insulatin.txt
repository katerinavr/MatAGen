Diluting organic semiconductors with a host insulating polymer is used to
increase the electronic mobility in organic electronic devices, such as thin Ô¨Ålm
transistors, while considerably reducing material costs. In contrast to organic
electronics, bioelectronic devices such as the organic electrochemical
transistor (OECT) rely on both electronic and ionic mobility for eÔ¨Écient
operation, making it challenging to integrate hydrophobic polymers as the
predominant blend component. This work shows that diluting the n-type
conjugated polymer p(N-T) with high molecular weight polystyrene (10 KDa)
leads to OECTs with over three times better mobility-volumetric capacitance
product (ŒºC*) with respect to the pristine p(N-T) (from 4.3 to 13.4 F V‚àí1
cm‚àí1 s‚àí1) while drastically decreasing the amount of conjugated polymer (six
times less). This improvement in ŒºC* is due to a dramatic increase in
electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude, from 0.059 to 1.3 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1
for p(N-T):Polystyrene 10 KDa 1:6. Moreover, devices made with this polymer
blend show better stability, retaining 77% of the initial drain current after
60 minutes operation in contrast to 12% for pristine p(N-T). These results
open a new generation of low-cost organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors
where the bulk of the Ô¨Ålm is made by a commodity polymer.

1. Introduction
Organic mixed ionic-electronic conduc-
tors are materials that exhibit mixed elec-
tronic and ionic conductivity, allowing a
wide range of applications, from actua-
tion and sensing to energy conversion and
storage.[1,2] Their low operating voltages,
tunable properties, and ease of process-
ing enabled their use in bioelectronic de-
vices such as stimulating electrodes, ion
pumps, neuromorphic circuits, and organic
electrochemical transistors (OECTs).[3] The
OECT is a transducing ampliÔ¨Åer that uses
a mixed ionic-electronic conductor in the
form of a thin Ô¨Ålm between source and
drain contacts, through which electronic
charge carriers are transported.[4,5] The con-
centration of such charge carriers is mod-
ulated by the penetration or extraction
of electrolyte ions upon application of a
gate bias. For most applications, the elec-
trolyte is water-based, meaning that the

thin Ô¨Ålm must adjust to the inclusion of hydrated electrolyte ions
throughout the bulk of the material upon device switching.
ùúã-conjugated polymers are the most common type of mixed
ionic-electronic conductors used as core OECT components.[4,6]
They can be classiÔ¨Åed as p- or n-type depending on their abil-
ity to stabilize holes or electrons as charge carriers, respectively.
While both types of materials are important for several bioelec-
tronic applications, such as biosensors and complementary cir-
cuits, n-type conjugated polymers had a relatively slower develop-
ment with respect to their p-type counterpart.[7] Molecular design
strategies have thereby been adopted to ensure that also n-type
conjugated polymers provide a good balance of ionic and elec-
tronic mobility and stability in OECT device operation. Examples
include introducing new building blocks,[8] functional groups,[9]
and balancing the number, position, and extent of side groups,
such as glycol and alkyl side chains.[10,11] Other strategies, besides
chemical structure modiÔ¨Åcations, include solvent engineering,
incorporating additives, or blending with other materials to en-
hance the overall performance of the OECT device.[12‚Äì14]
Most eÔ¨Äorts on polymer blends for OECTs are restricted to
charged or hydrophilic polymers used as dopants or to pro-
vide new functionalities. Blending with charged polymer dopants
led to some of the most remarkable examples of conducting
polymer blends. Poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) doped with
poly(styrene sulfonate) PEDOT:PSS is one of the most inves-
tigated p-type organic conductor, providing hole conductivity
over 1000 S cm‚àí1 and excellent ambient stability.[15] Similarly,

is poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline):poly(ethyleneimine)
(BBL:PEI), leading to conductivity up to 7.7 ¬± 0.5 S cm‚àí1 for
50 wt% PEI content.[12] Blending with polar insulating polymers
introduced new functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups for bio-
functionalization or radical groups for doping.[16,17] An exam-
ple is the ternary blend of PEDOT:PSS with polyvinylalcohol
(PVA).[17] However, for this blend, incorporation of the PVA com-
ponent led to a decrease in Ô¨Ålm conductivity and a subsequent
degradation in OECT performance.
Polymer blends formed by ‚Äúdiluting‚Äù organic semiconduc-
tors with a ‚Äúhost‚Äù insulating polymer have been introduced to
improve electronic performance, stability, and processability in
optoelectronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs), solar cells, and Ô¨Åeld-eÔ¨Äect transistors (FETs).[18‚Äì22] The
most remarkable result of integrating high concentrations of in-
sulators into organic semiconducting Ô¨Ålms, leading to the so-
called ‚Äúdiluted organic semiconductors,‚Äù is the dramatic decrease
in charge trapping, leading to an enhancement in charge carrier
mobility by several orders of magnitude.[18] For example, blend-
ing poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT with polystyrene (PS) resulted
in FETs where the concentration of the semiconductor was re-
duced to values as low as 3 wt%.[23] Such a strategy provides the
double advantage of improving device performance while abat-
ing material costs, considering that insulating polymers such
as PS and polyvinyl carbazole (PVK) are commodity materials
synthesized at a fraction of the cost compared to most organic
semiconductors.[18]
Despite these beneÔ¨Åts, to date, there has been no attempt
to blend organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors with large
amounts of insulating polymers to increase the performance
of OECTs. The main challenge is that the high-bandgap poly-
mers that have been tested so far as host materials, such as PS,
PVK, and poly(9,9-di-n-octylÔ¨Çuorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO), are very hy-
drophobic. While hydrophobicity is not an issue for organic elec-
tronic devices that rely only on electronic transport, such as FETs,
the impact of the host polymer on the mixed ionic-electronic con-
ductivity of the Ô¨Ålms and OECT operation is not straightforward.
In this work, we show that dilution of the n-type semi-
conductor p(N-T), a copolymer based on aza-substituted bis(2-
oxoindolin-3-ylidene)-benzodifuran-dione acceptor units and
thiophene donor units (see Figure 1a for chemical structure),
with PS drastically increases the electronic mobility and provides
iontronic conductivity in water. We demonstrate that this new
generation of OECT materials, made using the diluted semi-
conductor strategy, show better device performance and stability
with respect to pristine conjugated polymer-only OECTs. In addi-
tion, we elucidate the impact of the hydrophilicity and molecular
weight of the insulator component on the mixed ionic/electronic
conductivity of the Ô¨Ålms.
2. Results and Discussion
We chose p(N-T) polymer because of its good processability, al-
lowing the preparation of bicomponent blends from organic sol-
vents such as chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene. OECTs made
using p(N-T) exhibit a low threshold voltage of 0.25 V and nor-
malized transconductance of 0.72 S cm‚àí1 deriving from p(N-T)
mixed ionic/electronic conductivity, with an average product of
mobility and volumetric capacitance ŒºC* of 4.3 F cm‚àí1 V‚àí1 s‚àí1.[24]

the insulating polymers used in this study. Transfer curves and related transconductance gm for the n-type conjugated polymer p(N-T) at increasing con-
centrations of d) polystyrene 10 KDa (PS10K) e) polystyrene 1 KDa (PS1K), and f) poly(methyl methacrylate) 10 KDa (PMM10K). All the measurements
were acquired for drain voltage VDS = 0.4 V with 0.1 m NaCl in water as the electrolyte. The gate was a silver pellet. The transfer curves are the average
of a minimum of Ô¨Åve devices. The measurements were acquired with a scan rate of 5.36 mV s‚àí1.
A signiÔ¨Åcant drawback of p(N-T) is the rapid decline in de-
vice performance to 63% of the initial ON current after just 30
min of continuous ON/OFF cycling (at drain voltage (VDS) of
0.4 V and gate voltage (VG) ON/OFF cycles from 0 to 0.35 V),
making it unsuitable for most applications such as sensors,
where stable device operation is of essence to ensure reliable
measurements.
To fabricate diluted OECTs, we blended p(N-T) with increasing
amounts of insulating polymers, prepared by mixing stock solu-
tions of 10 g L‚àí1 p(N-T) with 50 g L‚àí1 insulating polymer at diÔ¨Äer-
ent ratio in chloroform:o-dichlorobenzene (10:1 v/v, see Figure 1b
and Table S1, Supporting Information). To study the impact of
the ‚Äúhost‚Äù material on device performance, we chose three types
of insulating polymer: polystyrene 10 kDa, polystyrene 1 kDa,
and poly(methyl methacrylate) 10 KDa, hereafter referred to as
PS10K, PS1K, and PMM10K, respectively. The two diÔ¨Äerent types
of PS are chosen to elucidate the impact of the molecular weight
on the transport properties of the blend and device performance.
Moreover, PMM allows the investigation of the inÔ¨Çuence of a
more hydrophilic backbone ‚Äì provided by the ester groups of
PMM ‚Äì on material and device properties.
We evaluated OECT performance using a silver pellet as the
gate and 0.1 m NaCl in water as the electrolyte. As for devices
made using the pristine p(N-T), all the diluted OECTs work in
accumulation mode upon application of positive drain voltages
VDS and positive gate voltages VG, consistent with the n-type
character of p(N-T) and doping upon injection of Na+ ions from
the electrolyte solution (output characteristics can be found in
Figure S1, Supporting Information and transfer characteristics
in Figure 1d‚Äìf).
First, we investigated the impact of increasing amounts of
insulator on the performance of diluted OECTs. OECT trans-
fer characteristics of p(N-T):PS10K 1:3, with three styrene
monomers for each monomer of p(N-T), does not lead to dras-
tic changes in device current and transconductance (Figure 1d).
Increasing the amount of PS10K to 6 styrene monomers for each
monomer of p(N-T) leads to a drastic increase of maximum drain
current and transconductance (gm,max) from 0.16 mS for p(N-T)
to 0.34 mS for p(N-T):PS10K 1:6. Increasing further the amount
of PS10K to p(N-T):PS10K 1:17 leads to a decrease in gm,max to
0.12 mS, likely due to a disruption of the percolation network
by high amounts of the insulator in the blend. Similar results
were obtained for PS1K and PMM10K, where the monomer ra-
tio p(N-T):insulator 1:6 exhibited the highest values of maximum
transconductance. Thus, we focused on the p(N-T):insulator ratio
1:6 for further investigation.
Since the volume of the polymer in the channel is essential to
compare diÔ¨Äerent materials, we normalized maximum transcon-
ductance values to the area and thickness of the polymer Ô¨Ålms
according to Equation 1. All the tested insulators showed that di-
luted OECTs with monomer ratio p(N-T):insulator 1:6 lead to an
increase in OECT channel current and normalized transconduc-
tance gm,norm with respect to devices made with pristine p(N-T).
If we compare the transfer characteristics for 1:6 p(N-T):insulator
ratio across the three diÔ¨Äerent insulators, we realize that PS10K
leads to the highest gm,norm value of 2.0 mS cm‚àí1, followed by
1.0 mS cm‚àí1 for PMM10K, and 0.9 mS cm‚àí1 for PS1K
(Figure 2a,b and Table 1). All the blends have a comparable
threshold voltage of VTH = 0.25 V with respect to pristine p(N-
T), except for p(N-T):PS10K, exhibiting a VTH of 0.27 V.

To evaluate blends performance, we calculated the product
of electronic charge carrier mobility and volumetric capaci-
tance ŒºC* using the equation.

where W, d and L are the channel width, depth, and

is

spect to pristine p(N-T) with ŒºC* = 4.3 F V‚àí1 cm‚àí1 s‚àí1.
In contrast, PS1K and PMM10K show a modest increase in ŒºC*
of 5.3 and 4.9 F V‚àí1 cm‚àí1 s‚àí1, respectively.
We further used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
to extract the volumetric capacitances C* of the blends
(see Figures S2‚ÄìS5, Supporting Information and experimental
section for details) and to understand the impact of the insulators
on volumetric capacitance and electron mobility. As expected,
the introduction of the insulators has a negative impact on the
volumetric capacitance of the Ô¨Ålms, with a decrease of C* from
73 F cm‚àí3 for p(N-T) to 10.1 F cm‚àí3 for p(N-T):PS10K, 9.0 F
cm‚àí3 for p(N-T):PS1K, and 7.9 F cm‚àí3 for p(N-T):PMM10K. We
found however that the increase in transconductance and ŒºC*
for the blends is caused by a dramatic increase in the mobility
of electron charge carriers from 0.059 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 for p(N-T) to
0.6 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 for p(N-T):PS1K, 0.6 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 for p(N-
T):PMM10K, and the record 1.3 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1 for p(N-T):PS10K.
Comparison with other n-type OECT channel materials reported
in the literature (Figure 2c and Table S2, Supporting Information)
show that the blend p(N-T):PS10K 1:6 exhibits Œºe,OECT one order
of magnitude higher than the best reported to date (0.27 cm2 V‚àí1
s‚àí1 for P(gTDPP2FT)).
Our data agree well with previous reports showing increased
charge carrier mobility upon diluting organic semiconductors

with insulating polymers.[18,20,21] Similarly, as in Ô¨Åeld eÔ¨Äect
transistors, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics, we observe
that this ‚Äúdilution eÔ¨Äect‚Äù is concentration dependent. For all the
blends, device performance declines when the p(N-T):insulator
ratio is increased to 1:17, likely due to an interruption in the in-
terpenetrating network of semiconductor-rich phases.[21]
Stability is one of the most important criteria for OECT appli-
cations, particularly for sensors. Stability measurements at gate
voltage steps from 0 to 0.4 V for p(N-T) show that devices re-
tain only 12% of the original maximum drain current after over
60 min of ON/OFF switching (Figure 2d and Figure S6, Sup-
porting Information). Blending with PS10K leads to a remark-
able increase in device stability with respect to the pristine poly-
mer, with p(N-T):PS10K 1:6 OECT retaining 77% of the initial
maximum drain current ID,max after 1 hour of operation. A de-
cline in current is visible in the Ô¨Årst 10‚Äì15 minutes of opera-
tion, after which the maximum current settles at a constant value.
Blending with PS1K didn‚Äôt show the same eÔ¨Äect, leading to a re-
tention of just 15% of ID,max after 1 hour of operation. Blending
with PMM 10K led to 44% of ID,max after over 1 hours of switch-
ing; an intermediate value between PS10K and PS1K. Overall,
the data indicate that the molecular weight of the insulator and
its hydrophobic/hydrophilic character impact not only the initial
steady-state performance but also the operational stability upon
ON/OFF switching.
To elucidate the impact of the insulators on the ion penetra-
tion within the polymer Ô¨Ålms, we acquired ON/OFF switching
times. All devices show shorter OFF time constants with respect
to the ON constants, in line with hydrated electrolyte ions pen-
etration and release during the ON and OFF switches, respec-
tively (Figure S7 and Table S3, Supporting Information). The ON
time constant decreases in the order PS10K>PS1K>PMM10K,
consistent with a slower penetration of hydrated electrolyte ions
within the blends made using of the most hydrophobic polymers.
In contrast, OFF processes were faster upon blending with PS1K
with respect to the other two blends, which could be attributed
to a larger extent of ion entrapment within the polymer network
formed by the longer polymer chains.
To elucidate the eÔ¨Äect of the insulators on the packing of
the conjugated polymers in Ô¨Ålm form, we performed UV‚Äìvis-
NIR absorption spectroscopy. All Ô¨Ålms show a high-energy band
with a maximum at 433 nm, attributed to the ùúã-ùúã* transition,
and another band with maximum absorption at 756 nm with a
shoulder at ‚âà870 nm, ascribed to intermolecular charge transfer
(ICT) (Figure 3a). In contrast to the other blends, p(N-T):PS10K
exhibits a more pronounced vibrational shoulder, indicating a
slightly stronger intrachain ordering in p(N-T) aggregates.[20]
Moreover, another band appears at 1000‚Äì1200 nm, which might
originate from strong intermolecular aggregation.[25]
UV‚Äìvis-NIR spectroelectrochemistry further shows that nega-
tive potentials from 0 to ‚àí0.8 V lead to a decrease in the ùúã‚îÄùúã*
and ICT bands, accompanied by the formation of a new absorp-
tion band in the NIR region (Figure 3b and Figure S8, Supporting
Information) for p(N-T) and all the blends. The isosbestic point at

‚âà880 nm marks the interconversion of p(N-T) to its reduced state.
The absorption maximum of the new band, however, presents a
red-shift from 956 nm for the pristine p(N-T) polymer, to 959 nm
for p(N-T):PS1K, 965 nm for p(N-T):PMM10K, and 998 nm for
p(N-T):PS10K. Such a shift could originate from changes in p(N-
T) organization upon blending with diÔ¨Äerent insulators.
We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Grazing-
Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) to elucidate
the impact of dilution on the microstructure of the Ô¨Ålms. AFM
topography of p(N-T) shows a Ô¨Çat surface with root mean square
(RMS) roughness of 2.99 nm (Figure 3c and Figure S9, Sup-
porting Information). Blending of p(N-T) with insulating poly-
mers (1:6 p(N-T):insulating polymer monomer ratio) results in
the formation of aggregated domains, demonstrated by an in-
crease in RMS roughness to 6.24 nm for p(N-T):PS1K, 7.56 nm
for p(N-T):PS10K, and 10.83 nm for p(N-T):PMM10K. The data
indicate that the domain size depends on the molecular weight
and nature of the insulator, with a more extensive aggregation ob-
served for PS1K, followed by PS10K, and PMM10K (Figure 3c).
These features could originate from macro-phase separation
in the polymer Ô¨Ålm, with the formation of insulator-rich and
semiconductor-rich domains.[18,21] To conÔ¨Årm this hypothesis,
we acquired AFM micrographs of the pristine insulating poly-
mers (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The images show
smooth features with RMS roughness of 4.59 nm PS1K, 1.35 nm
for PS10K, and 1.17 nm for PMM10K, indicating that indeed the
increase in the roughness and formation of aggregates results
from the blending rather than aggregates already present in the
pristine insulating polymers.
GIWAXS data show that both the pristine polymer and the
blends have a face-on orientation (Table 2 and Figures S11‚ÄìS12,
Supporting Information). The ùúã‚îÄùúãstacking distance of p(N-T)
is 3.49 √Ö in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Blending
with insulating polymers leads to a slight decrease in (010) ùúã‚îÄùúã
diÔ¨Äraction peak both in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions
to 3.47 √Ö for PS1K, 3.45 √Ö for PS10K, and 3.43 √Ö for PMM10K, in-
dicating an undisturbed short-range intermolecular order upon
p(N-T) dilution.
Among the insulators, we found that the insulator‚Äôs type and
molecular weight strongly impact the crystallite coherence length
LC. High molecular weight polystyrene (PS10K) leads to an in-
crease in coherence length of the (010) peak both in-plane and
out-of-plane, indicating larger crystalline domains in the p(N-
T):PS10K Ô¨Ålms. Low molecular weight polystyrene (PS1K) leads
to a similar trend to PS10K, with a modest increase in the coher-
ence length of the (010) peak in-plane and out-of-plane. In con-
trast to PS10K and PS1K, blending with PMM10K leads to a de-
crease in the coherence length of (010) peak in-plane and a slight
increase in the coherence length in the out-of-plane direction.
Previous studies of polymer blends have shown that the struc-
ture of both the conjugated and insulating polymer in terms of
blend stoichiometry, choice of solvent, and molecular weight of
the polymers have an impact on crystallization, phase separation,
microstructure, thin Ô¨Ålm morphology, and charge carrier mobil-
ity of the Ô¨Ålms.[26]
Although PS and PMM are both amorphous polymers, there
are main diÔ¨Äerences in their chemical structure that could cause
a diÔ¨Äerent interaction with p(N-T), leading to changes in the mi-
crostructure and morphology of polymer Ô¨Ålms. PS has phenyl
groups in its chemical structure, while PMM has ester groups
with electronegative (thus partially negatively charged) oxygen
atoms. While PS can interact with p(N-T) via van-deer-Waals and
ùúã‚Äìùúãinteractions (through its phenyl groups),[27] PMM can in-
teract through a combination of electrostatic (both attractive and
repulsive) and van-der-Waals forces. This can have a dramatic im-
pact on the microstructure of a conjugated polymer with ethylene
glycol side chains, like p(N-T), where polymer chains also interact
via a combination of electrostatic (both attractive and repulsive)
and van-der-Waals forces.[28]
The diÔ¨Äerences in the microstructure of the polymer Ô¨Ålms are
also supported by AFM data, indicating that blending with PS
(both 1 KDa and 10 KDa) results in a more extensive aggregation
than blending with PMM 10 KDa.
Overall, AFM and GIWAXS data suggest that the observed in-
crease in electronic mobility for the blends is linked to aggrega-
tion and modiÔ¨Åcations in the microstructure of the polymer Ô¨Ålms
upon blending with the insulating polymers. The decrease in ùúã-ùúã
stacking distance and the formation of large crystalline domains
observed for p(N-T):PS10K 1:6 Ô¨Ålms correlate well with its supe-
rior charge transport among the blends.[29] In contrast, blending
with the low molecular weight polystyrene PS1K leads to a mi-
nor decrease in ùúã‚Äìstacking distance and increase in crystallite di-
mensions, which can be related to the smaller increases in charge
carrier mobility with respect to PS10K. Blending with PMM10K
leads to the shortest ùúã-ùúãstacking distance, but also a decrease in
crystallite dimensions in the (010) peak in in-plane with respect
to p(N-T), which could account for the comparable mobility with
respect to p(N-T):PS1K 1:6.
As OECTs work in contact with aqueous solutions, we used
contact angle measurements to elucidate the impact of the

insulating polymers on the wettability of the Ô¨Ålms. The data show
an increase in contact angle from 102¬∞ for p(N-T) to 115¬∞ upon
blending with both types of polystyrene (Figure S13 and Table S4,
Supporting Information). In contrast, blending with PMM leads
to a decrease in contact angle to 81¬∞, due to the hydrophilic na-
ture of ester groups. These data agree well with the ON switching
times, showing slower penetration within the most hydrophobic
Ô¨Ålms.
Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
monitoring (EQCM-D) data were then acquired to record in situ
swelling of the Ô¨Ålms upon exposure to an aqueous electrolyte and
injection of hydrated electrolyte ion from solution during electro-
chemical doping.[30]
First, we measured the QCM-D signals from the bare crystals
in air (Figures 4a and S15, Supporting Information). Then, we
removed the crystals and measured the signals for the polymer
Ô¨Ålms in air. The Ô¨Ålms were then exposed to 0.1 m NaCl(aq) to mon-
itor swelling upon exposure to the electrolyte.[31,32] Among the
blends, p(N-T):PS1K shows the largest increase in Ô¨Ålm thickness
from 104 to 180 nm, leading to 75% of passive swelling (Figure 4b
and Table S5, Supporting Information). p(N-T):PMM10K Ô¨Ålms
show a modest increase in the thickness from 83 to 98 nm (18%
swelling), while p(N-T):PS10K undergoes the least changes from
87 to 98 nm (13% passive swelling). These data indicate that the
molecular weight of the polymer has a strong impact on pas-
sive water and ion uptake from the electrolyte, with the largest
changes observed for the short polystyrene.
Before EQCM-D measurements, we performed Ô¨Åve break-in
cycles using cycling voltammetry (CV) at potentials between 0.2
and ‚àí0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl. CV data show that all the Ô¨Ålms
share a reduction peak at ‚âà‚àí0.4 V, and an oxidation band at
‚âà‚àí0.3 V (Figure 4c). Then, we acquired EQCM-D measurements
using chronoamperometry by applying the oxidative potential
of 0.2 V for 250 s, followed by reduction at ‚àí0.5 V for 250 s
(Figure 4d and Figure S16, Supporting Information). Also in this
case, p(N-T):PS10K undergoes the least changes, with 14% addi-
tional swelling. Blending with PS1K and PMM10K leads to a fur-
ther 24% and 41% swelling, respectively. The additional swelling
for p(N-T):PMM10K can be attributed to the higher polarity of
PMM monomers that, in contrast to polystyrene, could help ac-
commodate hydrated electrolyte ions through the formation of
hydrogen bonds.[33] We note that the trend observed in swelling

percentage upon doping (PMM10K>PS1K> PS10K) does not
correlate with the trend in C* PS10K‚â•PMM10K‚â•PS1K. A simi-
lar phenomenon was observed for polymers having a large extent
of glycol side chains. In this case, the additional swelling was at-
tributed to stabilizing water uptake, rather than increasing ion
uptake, in the doped state.[32]
Overall, the data suggest that the hydrophobic nature of
PS10K, combined with its high molecular weight, provides
the lowest amounts of swelling upon electrochemical measure-
ments, accounting for the higher stability of p(N-T) OECTs di-
luted with this insulating polymer. We note that, when the open
circuit voltage of 0.2 V is applied again, the thickness of the p(N-
T):PS10K does not fully return to the original value, indicating a
non-reversible swelling of the polymer Ô¨Ålm upon application of
reductive potentials and corroborating the initial decrease of IDS
current upon ON/OFF switching observed in stability measure-
ments (Figure 2d).
The shorter chains of PS1K provide lower protection upon
mass intake at the early stages of polymer contact with the elec-
trolyte, which could account for the relatively poorer improve-
ment in device stability upon p(N-T) dilution with PS1K. The hy-
drophilic nature of PMM10K causes the largest extent of swelling
upon electrochemical measurements, which is likely to disrupt
the polymer network during cycling, causing the observed irre-
versible changes in device performance.
To address whether this approach could be used with other
n-type conjugated polymers, we blended p(C-T), p(C-2T), and
f-BTI2g-TVTCN with polystyrene 10 KDa at a 1:6 monomer
ratio.[24,9] p(C-T) is structurally similar to p(N-T), with the diÔ¨Äer-
ence that isatins replace azaisatins groups within the acceptor
unit. p(C-2T) has a similar chemical structure to p(C-T), with the
diÔ¨Äerence that bis-thiophenes replace the thiophene donor units.
In contrast, f-BTI2g-TVTCN has a completely diÔ¨Äerent chem-
ical structure, with fused bithiophene imide dimer (f-BTI2) as
the acceptor unit and cyano-functionalized thienylene‚Äìvinylene‚Äì
thienylene (TVT) as the donor unit. Our data show that, for
all these polymers, blending with the hydrophobic PS10 KDa
leads to an increase in the threshold voltage (Figures S17‚ÄìS19,
and Table S6, Supporting Information). The extent of the shift
depends on the nature of the conjugated polymer, with the
largest increase observed for f-BTI2g-TVTCN (from VTH = 0.79
to 0.85 V). These data agree well with previous reports on the
relation between the hydrophobicity of the polymer Ô¨Ålm and
the threshold voltage. For OECTs operating in an aqueous elec-
trolyte (e.g., 0.1 m NaCl(aq)), increasing the hydrophobicity of
the polymer Ô¨Ålm, for example, by replacing ethylene glycol side
chains with alkyl side chains, results in an increase in threshold
voltage.[34]
p(C-T) shows the largest increase in ŒºC* from 3.4 to 8.9 F V‚àí1
cm‚àí1 s‚àí1. In contrast, no signiÔ¨Åcant changes have been observed
for p(C-2T), indicating that small changes in the chemical struc-
ture of the conjugated polymer have a large impact on blend-
ing dynamics and eÔ¨Äective mixed ionic/electronic conductivity
of the blend. f-BTI2g-TVTCN:PS 10K leads to a modest decrease
in normalized transconductance (gm,norm) from 23.68 to 19.72 S
cm‚àí1, however, the sharper increase in transconductance (i.e., the
steeper the slope of the curve) with respect to the pristine poly-
mer determines an overall increase in ŒºC* from 112.8 to 131.0 F
V‚àí1 cm‚àí1 s‚àí1.
All the blends show an increase in operational stability with re-
spect of the pristine polymers. Blending p(C-T) with PS10K leads
to an increase of stability from 1.1% to 10.4% retain of the initial
drain-source current after over 1 hour operation. P(C-2T) stability
increases from 39.7% to 63.0% upon blending. f-BTI2g-TVTCN,
the most stable polymer in the series (97.5% retain in initial drain
current for the pristine polymer) leads to a further increase in
drain current, reaching 129.5% of the original drain current after
over 1 hour operation, which could be due to rearrangements in
the polymer Ô¨Ålm upon switching.
Overall, the results indicate that several factors impact the
mixed ionic/electronic conductivity and stability of n-type con-
jugated polymer:insulating polymer blends, such as the chemi-
cal structure of the conjugated and insulating polymers, the hy-
drophilic or hydrophobic character of the polymers, and the con-
jugated polymer:insulating polymer ratio.
3. Conclusions
The development of organic polymer blends such as PEDOT:PSS
and BBL:PEI enabled conducting materials with major impli-
cations for various technologies, including the organic electro-
chemical transistor. The realization of n-type OECTs, having
comparable performance with respect to p-type transistors, how-
ever, remains challenging.
Here, we demonstrated that blending n-type organic semi-
conductors with insulating commodity polymers can drastically
improve the performance of organic electrochemical transistors
while decreasing considerably the amount of conjugated poly-
mer needed (six times less). We speciÔ¨Åcally showed that long
polystyrene chains with 10 KDa molecular weight are the most
eÔ¨Äective in boosting OECT performance for the semiconducting
polymer p(N-T), leading to enhanced polymer mobility by two or-
ders of magnitude. This drastic increase compensates for the loss
in volumetric capacitance caused by the addition of the insulating
polymer, leading to an overall increase in ŒºC* by over three times
with respect to the pristine conjugated polymer. Data on the mi-
crostructure of the Ô¨Ålms show that these changes are due to an
increase in the packing of the conjugated polymer chains, leading
to better charge transport. In addition, the diluted polymer blend
displays a considerable increase in device stability from 12% re-
tain of the initial maximum drain current for p(N-T) to 77% for
p(N-T):PS10K 1:6. EQCM-D measurements showed that such an
increase in stability is related to a decrease in swelling of the Ô¨Ålms
both upon hydration and electrochemical doping.
We showed that this method can be applied also to improve the
OECT performance of other types of n-type conjugated polymer.
However, the mixed ionic/electronic transport of the blend and
device stability is inÔ¨Çuenced by several parameters, such as the
chemical structure and hydrophilic character of the polymers and
their blending ratio. Future work will focus on providing a deeper
understanding on the physical parameters underlying blend dy-
namics and to determine if this approach could be extended fur-
ther to other materials including p-type conjugated polymers.
Our work shows that blending an n-type conjugated poly-
mer with insulating polymers enables to develop organic mixed
ionic/electronic conductors with the highest electronic mobility
reported so far for n-type OECTs (1.3 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1). For diluted
organic semiconductors, it has been demonstrated that such an

increase in mobility originates from the suppression of charge
carrier trapping sites upon dilution.[18] Better methods to quan-
tify charge carrier traps in organic mixed ionic/electronic con-
ductors (OMIECs) in OECT conÔ¨Åguration would be needed to
verify if this is the case also for diluted OMIECs. Overall, dilu-
tion of OMIECs with cheap insulating polymers paves the way
for aÔ¨Äordable high-performance n-type organic iontronics.

Mw ‚âà1110 g mol‚àí1, and poly(methyl methacrylate) Mw ‚âà10 900 g mol‚àí1.

p(N-T) and 50 mg mL‚àí1 for the insulating polymers in chloroform:o-

p(N-T):insulating polymers ratio of 1:0, 1:6, and 1:17 in monomer weight.
For more details, see Table S1, Supporting Information.
UV‚Äìvis-NIR Absorption Spectroscopy:
UV‚Äìvis-NIR absorption spectra
were acquired with a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV‚Äìvis-NIR spectropho-
tometer. Thin Ô¨Ålms of the polymer blends were prepared by spin-coating
their solutions onto Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. Prior
to spin-coating, the ITO glasses were cleaned by ultrasonication in soapy
water for 15 min, followed by basic piranha cleaning in a solution of
H2O:H2O2:NH3 at ‚âà70 ¬∞C for 5‚Äì10 min, and then dried using an air gun.
Cyclic Voltammetry:
CV measurements were performed using a
Metrohm Autolab/PGSTAT101 potentiostat. The three-electrode setup
consisted of an Ag/AgCl (3 m KCl aqueous solution) as the reference elec-
trode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and thin Ô¨Ålms of the polymer spin-
coated on ITO-coated glass substrates as the working electrode. Films of
the polymers were prepared as described for UV‚Äìvis-NIR absorption mea-
surements. 0.1 m NaCl in water was used as the electrolyte.
UV‚Äìvis-NIR
Spectroelectrochemistry:
Spectroelectrochemical
mea-
surements were performed with a similar setup as for CV measurements,
with the three-electrode setup Ô¨Åtted inside a quartz cuvette. Amperomet-
ric measurements were carried out by applying subsequent potentials
with steps of 0.1 V. The potentials were applied for 15 s prior to recording
each absorption spectrum to ensure complete Ô¨Ålm stabilization at that
potential. An aqueous 0.1 m NaCl solution was used as the supporting
electrolyte.
Atomic Force Microscopy:
AFM measurements were carried out using
the tapping mode of Bruker Dimension Icon AFM with a XSC11/PT sil-
icon tip from MikroMasch (cantilever T = 270 nm, L = 210 Œºm, W =
30 Œºm, f0 = 80 kHz, k = 2.7 N m‚àí1). All polymer Ô¨Ålms were prepared by
spin-coating at 1000 rpm for 60 s and annealing in the oven at 120 ¬∞C for
10 min. A 5 √ó 5 Œºm area was imaged at 5 diÔ¨Äerent locations on the spin-
coated polymer on the glass substrate with a resolution of 512 √ó 512 pixels.
All the AFM images were processed using the Gwyddion 2.56 software, and
the statistical parameters, including the roughness, were calculated using
the ‚ÄúStatistical Parameter‚Äù tool on Gwyddion.
Grazing-incidence Wide-angle X-ray Scattering:
Samples for GIWAX
were prepared as described for Uv‚Äìvis-NIR absorption measurements,
with the only diÔ¨Äerence that p+ doped silicon wafers were used as the
substrates. The wafers were cleaned by subsequential sonication steps in
soapy water, ethanol, and isopropanol for 15 min each. An incidence angle
of 0.18¬∞ and a photon energy of 8 keV were used to record the scattering
patterns.
Fabrication of Organic Electrochemical Transistors:
Electrode contacts
were prepared by lift-oÔ¨Äprocess. Thermal evaporation was used to deposit
10 nm of chromium or titanium as an adhesion layer and 50 nm of gold
on soda-lime glass. Each channel had length L = 20 Œºm and width W =
500 Œºm. Solutions of the polymer blends were spin-coated at 1000 rpm for
60 s and annealed in the oven at 120 ¬∞C for 10 min. Film thicknesses were
measured with by a Tencor proÔ¨Ålometer. The obtained Ô¨Ålm thicknesses
were 85.5 ¬± 3.7 nm for p(N-T):PS10K, 150.2 ¬± 3.1 nm for p(N-T):PS1K,
and 164.9 ¬± 30.8 nm for p(N-T):PMM10K. 0.1 m NaCl in water was used
as the electrolyte and a silver pellet as the gate. Device characterization
was performed in air at room temperature using a Keithley 4200A-SCS pa-
rameter analyzer (Tektronix, USA) equipped with two source measurement
units (SMU) and one pulse measurement unit (PMU). The PMU was used
to measure the ON and OFF OECT switching times, which were calculated
as the time it took to reach 90% or 10% of the maximum drain current, re-
spectively. The switching times were acquired for OECTs having channels
with dimensions 10 √ó 100 Œºm (LxW).
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy:
EIS measurements were per-
formed using a BioLogic VSP potentiostat. The polymers were spin-coated
on top of square gold electrodes with an active area 4 or 8 mm2 at spin
speed of either 1000 rpm or 4000 rpm for 60 sec followed by annealing
in the oven at 120 ¬∞C. The polymer Ô¨Ålms on gold were used as the work-
ing electrode, an Ag/AgCl (3 m KCl aqueous solution) as the reference
electrode, and a platinum coil as a counter electrode. The electrolyte was
an aqueous 0.1 m NaCl solution. EIS measurements were performed at
‚àí0.4 V. The frequency was scanned from 100 kHz to 10 Hz at a sinus am-
plitude of 10 mV. The capacitance was extracted by Ô¨Åtting the data to a
modiÔ¨Åed Randle‚Äôs circuit model Rs(Rp||Q),[25] where Rs is the electrolyte
resistance, Q is a constant phase element, and Rp is the charge transfer
resistance, using ZFit (EC-Lab V11.41 software). The thickness of the Ô¨Ålms
was determined in a dry state with a Tencor proÔ¨Ålometer.
Contact Angle Measurements:
Contact angle measurements were per-
formed using a ThetaLite optical tensiometer (TL100, Biolin ScientiÔ¨Åc).
The contact angle was measured on at least three diÔ¨Äerent areas on
each sample by dropping a 20 ŒºL drop of deionized water and record-
ing a video (not shown). The video frames were then analyzed using the
OneAttension software to calculate the average contact angle for each
sample.
Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring:
QCM-D measurements were performed using a Q-sense analyzer (QE
401, Biolin ScientiÔ¨Åc, Gothenburg, Sweden). First, gold-coated QSense
sensors (QSX 301) were measured in air and after introducing 0.1 m NaCl
in milli-Q water at a constant rate of 0.1 mL min‚àí1. This allowed us to
assess the shifts in the QCM-D signals due to changes in media den-
sity from air to the aqueous electrolyte. For polymer Ô¨Ålm analysis, the
crystals were unloaded from the measuring chambers and used as sub-
strates for spin-coating of the polymer Ô¨Ålms. The polymers were spin-
coated at 2500 rpm for 60 s and annealed in the oven at 120 ¬∞C for 10
min. The crystals were placed back in the chamber and QCM-D signals
were acquired again in air. After frequency f and dissipation d signals sta-
bilized (i.e., Œîf < 1 Hz/2 min), we Ô¨Çushed in a solution of 0.1 m NaCl
in milli-Q water at a constant rate of 0.1 mL min‚àí1. After the measure-
ments, we used the QSoft software function ‚Äústitch data‚Äù to combine the
measurements of the bare crystals with those of the spin-coated polymer
Ô¨Ålms. The data were then modeled using the Sauerbrey equation within
the QSense DÔ¨Ånd software (Biolin ScientiÔ¨Åc). The model assumed the
use of a gold crystal in air as the initial reference, followed by the addi-
tion of a polymer layer of density comparable to polystyrene (1.0 g cm‚àí3)
in air, and Ô¨Çushing with an aqueous electrolyte solution with density of
1.04 g cm‚àí3.
EQCM-D measurements were performed with a QSense electrochem-
istry module (QEM 401) connected to a Metrohm Autolab/PGSTAT101
potentiostat. The module was equipped with a Pt counter electrode, an
Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and the polymer-coated gold sensor as the
working electrode. 0.1 m NaCl in milli-Q water was the electrolyte. After
Ô¨Ålm hydration, we waited again for the signal to be Ô¨Çat before starting with
the electrochemical measurements. First, a cyclic voltammetry was per-
formed at potentials between 0.2 and ‚àí0.5 V at a scan rate of 0.1 V s‚àí1.

Then, we performed a chronoamperometric measurement by stepping the
potential from 0.2 V (fully undoped) to ‚àí0.5 V (fully doped) and 0.2 V again
for 150 s each.
Swelling was calculated as the percentage change in thickness relative
to the dry thickness (Tdry), assuming that all the Ô¨Ålms had the same surface
area determined by the area of the gold sensor (0.7854 cm2)
