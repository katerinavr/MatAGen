The schematic illustrates how various device relevant properties can be dynamically tuned or intentionally designed into the structure of the material as well as the mechanism by which the specific property is modulated. For example, adjusting the electric potential of a device can dynamically alter the conductivity of an OMIEC by changing the charge carrier density in the material (top left). On the other hand, substitution of different backbone moieties into the structure of the material will also alter the conductivity by changing the carrier mobility in the OMIEC (top right). Similar relationships are shown for different dynamic and chemical (static) tuning methods and various properties. The mechanisms by which properties are modulated are shown at the bottom of the schematic.",

The simultaneous increase in compensating ion concentration reduces elastic modulus and bandgap.",
