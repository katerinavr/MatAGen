Currently, n-type small-molecule mixed ionic-electronic conductors remain 
less explored and their molecular design rules are not mature enough. 
Herein, two n-type glycolated imide-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (IPAHs), d-gdiPDI and t-gdiPDI, are developed to probe the effects of 
molecular conformation on the electronic, electrochemical, morphological, 
and coupled ionic-electronic transport properties. It is found that the highly 
twisted scaffold in d-gdiPDI, compared to the nearly planar one of t-gdiPDI, 
has a strong positive effect on the charge storage properties and thus the per-
formance of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). d-gdiPDI exhibits 
a volumetric capacitance of 657 F cm−3, obviously outperforming that of 
t-gdiPDI (261 F cm−3), which is the highest value reported to date for small-
molecule OECT materials. Moreover, a high charge-storage capacity of up 
to 479 F g−1 is observed for d-gdiPDI. Arising from such high ionic-electronic 
coupling characteristic, d-gdiPDI-based OECTs present a ≈2 × times higher 
geometry-normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 105.3 mS cm−1 relative 
to that of t-gdiPDI counterparts. Significantly, further application of d-gdiPDI 
in solid-electrolyte OECTs delivers a gm,norm of 142.4 mS cm−1. These findings 
indicate that IPAHs are very promising candidates for n-type small-molecule 
OECTs and highlight the superiority of twisting conformation manipulation in 
materials design toward high-performance electrochemical devices.

devices, including organic electrochemical 
transistors (OECTs),[1–3] electrochemical 
charge storage devices,[4–6] and electro-
chromic displays.[7,8] The functionality 
of all fronts is principally governed by 
the ionic transport, electronic transport, 
and ionic-electronic coupling characteris-
tics of OMIECs. The intricate and subtle 
relationship between these contributing 
factors, such as the trade-off between 
ionic and electronic mobility, in turn, 
poses a massive challenge for the struc-
tural design and synthesis of OMIECs 
with desirable electrochemical properties, 
mixed volumetric conduction and opera-
tional stability in ambient and aqueous 
environments. 
Until 
now, 
although 
remarkable progress has been made in 
the development of efficient OMIECs,[9–13] 
this subfield of organic semiconductors 
is still at its early stage and the molecular 
design principles remain immature. Con-
tinuous research on the exploration of 
new building blocks, design and optimi-
zation of molecular structures, and cor-
relations between material chemistry, 
properties, and performance of functional 
devices is an essential prerequisite for gaining more funda-
mental insights into the physics of ionic and electronic charge 
transport and for further advancing the OMIEC field as a 
whole, which has aroused widespread concern in the research 
community.[14–16]

In the case of OECT, upon a small applied bias (<1  V), 
the channel conductivity can be dramatically altered by the 
changes in doping state in the channel bulk due to the infil-
tration of ions from the operational electrolyte. This fantastic 
ion-to-current transducing feature appears particularly attrac-
tive for chemical and biological sensors, and neuromorphic 
engineering.[17–23] In addition, the OECT based on solid or gel 
electrolytes is also highly sought after as it broadens its appli-
cation scope and shows promise as flexible and wearable elec-
tronics.[24–28] In order to realize a high-transconductance OECT, 
the organic semiconductor channel layer is supposed to have 
a combination of high charge carrier mobility, preferably with 
a densely packed crystalline film morphology, and high charge 
storage capacity that largely depends on facile ion diffusion into 
the channel. Impressively, the past few years have witnessed a 
rapid expansion of the library of new materials and significant 
advances in the pursuit of these two properties, thanks to the 
synthetic strategy of grafting oligo ethylene glycol (OEG) side-
chains onto traditional excellent electron- and hole-transporting 
backbones to facilitate ionic intercalation.[29–37] In particular, the 
transconductance of p-type OMIECs has reached over 200 S 
cm−1.[12] By comparison, the n-type ones in terms of mixed con-
duction performance, however, have remained far behind,[13,38] 
despite that they are highly desirable for applications in comple-
mentary logic circuits, supercapacitors, and enzymatic sensors 
based on electron transfer.[39–41] Motivated by the unbalanced 
development of p- and n-type OECTs, the OECT community 
has recently turned its main focus toward the more challenging 
n-type counterpart. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the 
majority of n-type OECT materials studied in current literature 
are based on conjugated polymers, while the investigation of 
small molecule-based n-type OECTs is relatively rare, with only 
a few cases reported, and their performance falls behind that 
of the state-of-the-art polymer-based analogs.[42–46] Small mole-
cule semiconductors, however, remain extraordinarily attractive,  
since they are typically easier to purify to a high standard 
without batch-to-batch variations, have well-defined structures, 
and the monodisperse nature of them allows for straightfor-
ward elucidation of structure-property relations. To this end, 
developing novel and diverse n-type small-molecule OMIECs 
with improved OECT performance is of particular interest to us.
Imide-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (IPAHs) fea-
turing extended π-conjugation and strong electron-deficient 
nature have attracted remarkable attention in organic field-
effect transistors, organic solar cells, and energy storage appli-
cations, due to their unique optical and redox properties and 
interesting π-π stacking motifs.[47–51] The simplest representa-
tive is the perylene diimide (PDI), which comprises two imide 
functionalities at the peri region of a five-ring perylene unit, and 
is among the most studied building blocks for n-type organic 
semiconductors toward functional devices with promising per-
formance.[52–55] As a tentative exploration, in our previous work, 
we developed for the first time a series of small molecules based 
on tetrachlorinated PDI-bearing OEG side chains for n-type 
OECTs.[43] The fabricated devices can afford a normalized peak 
transconductance of 45.2 mS cm−1 and impressive operational 
stability, which were further utilized for hydrogen peroxide 
sensing, and a low detection limit of 0.75 µM was obtained. The 
results highlight new and great opportunities for PDI used as 
a strong electron-accepting unit to construct high-performance 
n-type small-molecule mixed conductors, worthy of more sys-
tematic investigations into the structure-property relationships 
of the materials derived therefrom and thus contributing to the 
general development of small-molecule OECTs.
Herein, through the homocoupling of tetrachlorinated PDI, 
we report the synthesis and characterization of two bay-linked 
glycolated PDIs with different kinds of linkages, namely doubly- 
and triply-linked PDI dimers (d-gdiPDI and t-gdiPDI, Scheme 1), 
and investigated how the changes in backbone conformation 
induced by the linkage mode between PDI units affects the

electronic, optical, capacitive, and molecular stacking proper-
ties, as well as corresponding electrochemical device perfor-
mance. It is found that d-gdiPDI displays a twisted structure 
with an almost cruciform conformation, while t-gdiPDI has a 
rigid and almost planar skeleton, as revealed by DFT calcula-
tions. The high twisting effect exerts a favorable impact on the 
charge storage property, providing d-gdiPDI with a remarkably 
higher volumetric capacitance of 657 F cm−3 than 261 F cm−3 for 
t-gdiPDI in a 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte. When coupled with 
an ionic gel, d-gdiPDI also demonstrated a high specific capaci-
tance of 479 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Benefitting from 
the excellent ionic-electronic coupling property, d-gdiPDI-based 
n-type OECTs afforded a nearly double higher geometry-normal-
ized transconductance of 105.3 mS cm−1, as compared to that of 
55.5 mS cm−1 for t-gdiPDI counterparts. More importantly, solid-
electrolyte OECT has been further fabricated using d-gdiPDI as 
the active channel layer, delivering a low VTH of 0.11 V and a nor-
malized transconductance of 142.4 mS cm−1. This work demon-
strates that hydrophilic IPAHs can be attractive candidates for 
OECTs and energy storage devices, and the structure-property-
device performance relationships revealed here provided impor-
tant guidance for future design of higher-performing small mol-
ecule OMIECs for electrochemical devices.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Synthesis and Characterization
The synthetic routes consisting of two steps for PDI dimer-based 
small molecules are depicted in Scheme  1, and the synthetic 
details are available in Supporting Information. The starting 
material 4Cl-PTCDA was reacted with amino-triethylene glycol 
to give intermediate 4Cl-PDI-3EG. The functionality of trieth-
ylene glycol side chain at the nitrogen position of imide aims to 
facilitate ion transport and ensure solution processability of the 
final molecules. For the dimer d-gdiPDI, it was prepared from 
4Cl-PDI-3EG via the homocoupling in anhydrous dimethyl sul-
foxide (DMSO) with a stoichiometric amount of copper powder 
as the reagent and Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. While in the syn-
thesis of the dimer t-gdiPDI, compound 4Cl-PDI-3EG underwent 
a one-spot domino reaction involving Ullmann coupling and 
CH transformation in anhydrous DMSO, using a stoichio-
metric amount of copper iodide as the reagent, l-proline as the 
ligand and potassium carbonate as the base. Both d-gdiPDI and 
t-gdiPDI could be readily purified by column chromatography 
on silica gel and their structures were fully characterized by 1H 
NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF (see Supporting Information). 
All materials presented good solubility in common organic sol-
vents such as toluene, chloroform, and dichloromethane at room 
temperature. The thermal properties of these two molecules were 
characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a 
nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Infor-
mation), the temperatures corresponding to 5% weight loss were 
determined to be 397 °C for d-gdiPDI and 345 °C for t-gdiPDI, 
indicating good thermal stability of them.
2.2. Theoretical Calculations
To elucidate the impact of connection mode on the geometric 
and electronic properties of these two PDI dimers, density 
functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the 
B3LYP/6-31G(d) basis set, and the long OEG side chain was 
replaced with 2-methoxyethyl group to simplify the calculations. 
The optimized molecular geometries are presented in Figure 1.

A large dihedral angle of 64o was found between two perylene 
moieties in d-gdiPDI, indicating a very high twisting of the 
molecular skeleton. In contrast, t-gdiPDI adopts an almost-
planar geometry, and the torsion angle between the two adja-
cent PDI units is significantly reduced to 25o. The pronounced 
difference in the backbone conformation between d-gdiPDI and 
t-gdiPDI results in varying degrees of π-electron delocalization, 
as shown by the electron density distribution in the frontier 
molecular orbitals (Figure 1). The lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO) wavefunction of t-gdiPDI is delocalized over the 
entire conjugated π-system, while the highest occupied molecular 
orbital (HOMO) is mainly localized on the two perylene moie-
ties. Disparate results were obtained for d-gdiPDI, in which 
the LUMO wavefunction is predominantly localized on one 
PDI unit, while the HOMO wavefunction is mostly localized 
on the perylene moiety of the other PDI unit. The calculated 
HOMO and LUMO energy levels for doubly linked d-gdiPDI are  
−6.21 and −3.68  eV, respectively. In comparison, triply linked 
t-gdiPDI exhibits a shallower HOMO energy level of −6.06  eV 
and a deeper LUMO energy level of −4.12 eV.
2.3. Photophysical and Electrochemical Properties
The ultraviolet  visible  near  infrared  (UV–vis–NIR)  absorption 
spectra for d-gdiPDI and t-gdiPDI in chloroform solution and 
in thin films are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information), 
and relevant optical properties are summarized in Table S1  
(Supporting Information). These two PDI dimers exhibited 
complex multi-peak features with well-resolved vibronic pro-
gressions in the absorption spectra similar to most PDI fami-
lies,[47] and presented two main absorption bands with the 
high energy ones located in the regime of 330−430  nm and 
the broader low energy ones located at 435−750 nm. Both mol-
ecules showed redshifted absorption spectra in film relative to 
those in solution, indicating that there is aggregation in the 
solid state to some extent. The longest absorbance maxima of 
d-gdiPDI in solution (λmax,sol) and film (λmax,film) states were 
located at 525 and 540 nm, respectively. In contrast, the λmax,sol 
and λmax,film of t-gdiPDI significantly bathochromically shifted 
to 654 and 669 nm, respectively, which can be ascribed to the 
extensive conjugation over the entire π-system of t-gdiPDI,[56] 
as evidenced by the DFT calculations showing nearly planar 
skeleton of t-gdiPDI (compared to the central highly twisted 
eight-membered ring in d-gdiPDI) favoring extended electron 
delocalization. Furthermore, based on their absorption onsets 
of thin films, the optical bandgaps (Egopt) were calculated to be 
1.73 and 2.16 eV for t-gdiPDI and d-gdiPDI, respectively.
To evaluate the energy levels of the molecules, cyclic vol-
tammetry (CV) measurements were conducted in anhydrous 
dichloromethane solutions under a nitrogen atmosphere, with 
0.1 m tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) as 
the supporting electrolyte and Ag/AgCl as the reference elec-
trode. The LUMO energy level was calculated based on the onset 
potential of the first reduction wave (E1r) versus the ferrocene/
ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox potential, according to the equation 
ELUMO = −(4.80 + E1r). As shown in Figure S3a,b (Supporting 
Information), the E1rs were found to be −0.49 and −0.77  eV 
for t-gdiPDI and d-gdiPDI, respectively, corresponding to the 
LUMO energy levels at −4.31 and −4.03  eV. The decreasing 
trend in LUMO levels when going from d-gdiPDI to t-gdiPDI is 
consistent with the DFT calculation results. The HOMO energy 
level was estimated by subtracting the optical bandgap from the 
LUMO energy level, giving the values of −6.04 eV for t-gdiPDI 
and −6.19 eV for d-gdiPDI. CV was further performed to under-
stand the electrochemical redox activity of small molecule films 
in a 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte at low oxygen concentration 
(Figure S3c,d, Supporting Information). It was observed that 
the cathodic waves were small for t-gdiPDI, likely ascribed to 
the continuous redox process of t-gdiPDI leading to a gradual 
consumption of the redox-active units of t-gdiPDI on the elec-
trode surface, from which the first reduction onset potential 
was extracted to be −0.015 V versus Ag/AgCl. In comparison, 
d-gdiPDI exhibited a pronounced cathodic wave with a higher 
onset potential at −0.19 V versus Ag/AgCl.
2.4. Spectroelectrochemical Properties
In order to study the doping kinetics of the small molecule 
films in a 0.1  m NaCl aqueous solution, the spectroelectro-
chemical measurements were carried out to record the evolu-
tions of the absorbance spectra of the films upon application 
of a successive step potential, as shown in Figure 2a,b. These 
two molecules displayed different optical profile changes with 
the external bias. For t-gdiPDI, as the potential was swept from 
+0.2 to −0.2 V, the transitions at 666, 611, 550, 512, and 412 nm 
gradually decreased in intensity to an almost disappearance of 
them, while that of the transition at 477 nm increased and blue-
shifted, and two new transitions at 585 and 802 nm grew in. 
These spectral changes are related to the formation of polaronic 
species on the molecular backbones upon electrochemical 
reduction.[29,57] In contrast, no spectral change was found upon 
applying potentials at 0.1 and 0 V versus Ag/AgCl for d-gdiPDI. 
Within further bias from −0.1 to −0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl with a 
−0.1 V potential increment, the transition peaks at 535, 495, and  
419  nm slowly decayed, accompanied by the emergence of a 
new absorption band centered at 757 nm, indicating the elec-
trochemical doping of d-gdiPDI film by the injected sodium 
ions and thus the formation of radical anion (polaron) species. 
Besides, we observed in Figure  2c,d, which plots the relative 
variations in the intensity of the polaronic absorption peak of 
films over the applied bias, that the polaronic absorption band 
began to appear at a lower potential for t-gdiPDI relative to 
d-gdiPDI, corresponding to an earlier doping onset. Further-
more, compared to d-gdiPDI, t-gdiPDI exhibited higher inten-
sity of polaronic absorption at the same potential (0.1 to −0.2 V), 
indicating its higher doping efficiency before the voltage of 
–0.2 V.
2.5. Capacitive Properties
Volumetric capacitance (C*) as an important parameter for 
OMIECs determines the OECT operation and needs to be 
particularly considered in materials design. The C*s of both 
molecules were assessed by performing electrochemical imped-
ance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in a 0.1 m NaCl aqueous

solution (Figure S4, Supporting Information). As shown in 
Table  1, d-gdiPDI delivered a maximum C* of 657 F cm−3, 
>2.5 times higher than that of t-gdiPDI (261 F cm−3). Note 
that the C* of d-gdiPDI is the highest value reported to date 
for small molecule OECT materials, and is also comparable 
to that of the n-type redox-active polymer BBL.[38] To ration-
alize the difference in the C* values between these two small 
molecules, the contact angles of both thin films were tested 
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). d-gdiPDI showed a con-
tact angle of 26.5°, much smaller than that of t-gdiPDI (65.5°). 
Previous studies have revealed that hydrophilic materials could 
facilitate hydration and ion penetration into the film, which in 
turn usually gives rise to higher volumetric capacitance.[32,35] In 
this regard, we would attribute the higher C* of d-gdiPDI to its 
more hydrophilic characteristic compared to t-gdiPDI.
As d-gdiPDI has demonstrated very high C*, its charge 
storage capability was further examined by CV and galvano-
static charge–discharge (GCD) measurements in a 0.1 m NaCl 
aqueous solution. To alleviate the issue of delamination of 
small molecule film in aqueous media upon the redox reaction, 
a layer of ionic gel (see Supporting Information for its prepa-
ration process) was covered on d-gdiPDI thin film during the 
test. Figure 3a presents the CV curves of thin film coated on  
ITO/glass with different scan rates from 5 to 50  mV s−1 at a 
potential window ranging from 0.2 to −0.8  V. The maximum 
gravimetric capacitance (Cg) was found to be 421 F g−1 at a scan 
rate of 20 mV s−1 (Table S2, Supporting Information), which is 
very impressive for hydrophilic organic electrode materials.[58] 
In the same potential window, the galvanostatic charge–
discharge (GCD) characteristics of d-gdiPDI film electrodes at

various current densities between 1 to 5 A g−1 were depicted in 
Figure 3b. The maximum specific capacitance (Cs) in this case 
was 479 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 (Table S3, Sup-
porting Information), which was retained as 278 F g−1 at a 
higher current density of 5 A g−1, outperforming previously 
reported NDI-based polymer electrodes in aqueous media.[6] 
However, d-gdiPDI exhibited unsatisfactory cycling stability 
(Figure S6, Supporting Information) in both CV and GCD 
measurements, possibly due to the electrochemical instability 
of d-gdiPDI caused by the uptake of hydrated ions at high 
charging potential.[6,59] This conjecture was confirmed by per-
forming the stability test using CV under a narrower potential 
window (0.2 to −0.3  V). As shown in Figure S7 (Supporting 
Information), the cycling stability was significantly improved 
with a capacity retention of 65% after 50 cycles, as compared to 
that of 10% when the charging potential window was between 
0.2 and −0.8 V (Figure S6a, Supporting Information). We sup-
pose that the cycling stability of d-gdiPDI could be further 
improved by side chain engineering, such as partly substituting 
OEG side chains with alkyl ones, introducing hybrid OEG-alkyl 
side chains, and using hydroxylated alkyl side chains, to achieve 
an optimal combination of electroactivity, mixed conductivity, 
swelling, and microstructural stability. Such molecular struc-
ture optimization is underway in our laboratory.
2.6. OECT Performance
Since these two small molecules have exhibited redox activity 
and high capacitances in aqueous electrolyte, their mixed 
ionic and electronic transport characteristics were further 
investigated by fabricating OECT devices with a 0.1  m NaCl 
aqueous solution as the electrolyte, as illustrated in Figure 4a. 
The product of charge carrier mobility (µ) and volumetric 
capacitance (C*), a key figure-of-merit to typically evaluate the 
mixed conduction property of an OMIEC, is deduced from the 
equation (1).

mode n-type OECTs for t-gdiPDI and d-gdiPDI are displayed 
in Figure 4b–e and related data are summarized in Table 1. At 
VDS = 0.40 V, VGS = 0.25 V, the drain current (IDS) reached the 
maximum value of 0.27 mA for t-gdiPDI, while its maximum 
transconductance (gm,max) was found to be 1.49 mS at VDS  = 
0.40 V, VGS = 0.21 V. In comparison, d-gdiPDI showed a higher 
IDS of 0.32  mA (VDS  = 0.40  V, VGS  = 0.45  V) and a gm,max up 
to 1.58 mS (VDS = 0.40 V, VGS = 0.45 V). It can be seen from 
Equation (1) that gm is a geometry-dependent parameter. Thus, 
in order to more fairly compare the gm of different OMIECs, 
the geometry-normalized transconductance (gm,norm) was fur-
ther calculated, giving the value of 100.7 ± 4.6 mS cm−1 for 
d-gdiPDI, which is almost 2-fold higher than 55.1 ± 0.4 mS cm−1  
for t-gdiPDI. As shown in Table 1, t-gdiPDI displayed a lower 
threshold voltage (VTH) of −0.07 ± 0.01  V in contrast with 
d-gdiPDI (VTH = 0.11 ± 0.01 V), which is in line with the trend 
of the reduction onset as well as the polaronic absorption onset 
in NaCl aqueous solution. To our best knowledge, the VTH of 
t-gdiPDI represents the lowest value reported to date for n-type 
OECT materials, which is very beneficial for OECT-based 
sensor applications.[60] The µC* product deduced from Equa-
tion (1) is 0.21 ± 0.02 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for t-gdiPDI and increases to  
0.33 ± 0.01 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for d-gdiPDI (Table 1), which is signif-
icantly higher than that of our recently reported PDI congener 
4Cl-PDI-3EG (0.17 ± 0.03 F cm−1 V−1 s−1).[43] Based on the C* 
value, the µC* was further decoupled to deliver the OECT elec-
tron mobilities (µe,OECT) of 8.3 × 10−4 and 5.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1  
for t-gdiPDI and d-gdiPDI, respectively. The higher µe,OECT 
of t-gdiPDI relative to d-gdiPDI could be ascribed to its more 
planar framework benefiting extended π-conjugation and more 
favorable π-stacking orientation (see the microstructure char-
acterization below). As for the response times, the turn-on 
(τON) and turn-off (τOFF) times were estimated via an exponen-
tial fit (Figure S8, Supporting Information), giving τON/τOFF of 
123 ± 6/41 ± 7  ms for t-gdiPDI and 87 ± 9/23 ± 1  ms for 
d-gdiPDI. The faster response speed of d-gdiPDI suggests the 
facile diffusion of the dopant ions into the channel, as sup-
ported by its higher hydrophilicity manifested in contact angle 
measurement. Finally, we examined the long-term operational 
stability of OECTs under continuous VGS pulses (−0.3−0.25 V

for t-gdiPDI, 0−0.4 V for d-gdiPDI, pulse length = 6 s) for 2 h, as 
shown in Figure 4f. Both t-gdiPDI- and d-gdiPDI-based OECTs 
presented stable operation in NaCl aqueous solution with no 
sign of degradation and only a slight fluctuation in the channel 
currents. The slightly increased drain current after repeated 
doping/dedoping cycles might be ascribed to the improved 
ion penetration into the thin film, thus facilitating the doping/
depoing process.[61]
To demonstrate the versatility of the d-gdiPDI, we further 
investigated the d-gdiPDI-based OECTs gated by an ion gel solid 
electrolyte. The gel electrolyte is composed of 19.5 wt.% gelatin, 
19.5  wt.% poly(sodium-p-styrene sulfonate), 1  wt.% d-sorbitol, 
1 wt.% glycerin, 0.4 wt.% NaCl and 58.6 wt.% deionized water, 
whose photograph of appearance is shown in Figure 5a. d-sorb-
itol is to increase the toughness of gel, and glycerin is used to 
improve the property of moisture retention. The details of the 
procedure used to make the gel electrolyte are described in Sup-
porting Information. A schematic of a side-gated OECT is shown 
in Figure 5a. The output and transfer curves along with the asso-
ciated transconductance of the solid-electrolyte OECT (SEOECT) 
doped with sodium cation are presented in Figure  5b,c. This 
SEOECT exhibited a low VTH of 0.11 V and a decent gm of 2.14 mS,  
with a corresponding gm,norm of 132.8 ± 9.6 mS cm−1, which is 
comparable to the devices operated in NaCl aqueous electrolyte. 
However, the SEOECT showed a slower transient speed with 
τON/τOFF of 748±79/89±11 ms, which should be ascribed to the 
increased ionic resistance in the gel electrolyte relative to 0.1 m 
NaCl electrolyte.[28] Importantly, the d-gdiPDI-based SEOECT 
exhibited high operational stability with no degradation in its ini-
tial channel current after 1 h of pulse measurement (Figure 5d). 
These data indicated that d-gdiPDI-based OECTs in combination 
with solid electrolytes might hold promise in the field of flexible 
electronics for real-time biosensor applications such as moni-
toring of low electrophysiological signals.
2.7. Microstructure Study
To investigate the evolution of the surface morphologies of 
these two small molecules, ex situ atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) measurements were conducted for the thin films in 
dry, hydrated, and doped states (Figure S9, Supporting Infor-
mation). In pristine state, both t-gdiPDI and d-gdiPDI exhib-
ited flat surface morphologies, with the root-mean-square 
roughness (RMS) of 0.44 and 0.59  nm, respectively. In the 
swelling state, the surfaces of both small molecules became 
rougher after immersing in 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte for 
10 min, with the RMS increasing to 0.52 nm for t-gdiPDI and 
0.71 nm for d-gdiPDI, mainly due to the uptake of water mol-
ecules. When the films were doped by subjecting them to the 
bias in 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte for 10 min, the RMS of 
both molecules further increased slightly compared with that 
of the swollen films, ascribed to the ingestion of hydrated ions 
into the films. 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scat-
tering (GIWAXS) studies were further performed to explore 
the molecular packing of small molecule semiconductors 
(Figure  6). These two small molecules exhibited similar (010) 
π−π stacking distances, with d-spacings of 4.03/4.08 Å in the 
out-of-plane direction and 4.03/4/05 Å in the in-plane direction 
for t-gdiPDI/d-gdiPDI (Table S4, Supporting Information). Sim-
ilar (010) diffraction peak was also observed in both out-of-plane 
and in-plane orientations for d-gdiPDI, while the (100) diffrac-
tion peak along the out-of-plane direction is obviously stronger 
than that of in-plane direction, suggesting a preferential edge-on

orientation of d-gdiPDI. In contrast, t-gdiPDI showed similar 
scattering intensities of (010) and (100) peaks in both in-plane 
and out-of-plane directions, which indicates its balanced orien-
tation of face-on and edge-on packing motifs. Unlike organic 
field-effect transistors, the OECT operates via ionic electro-
chemical volumetric doping/dedoping to modulate the elec-
trical conductivity in the channel layer, existing a delicate 
trade-off relationship between ion and charge carrier transport. 
In this respect, we speculate that the face-on/edge-on bimodal 
orientation of t-gdiPDI enabling 3D charge transport might con-
tribute to its higher charge mobility in contrast to d-gdiPDI.[44] 
Besides, it is interesting that d-gdiPDI displayed larger coher-
ence lengths (CLs) in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions 
(Table S4, Supporting Information), as compared to t-gdiPDI, 
presumably due to its highly twisted, almost-orthogonal scaf-
fold making the formation of multi-directional long-range 
organizations possible.[62]
3. Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized two bay-linked PDIs 
decorated with OEG side chains, d-gdiPDI and t-gdiPDI, where 
the two PDI units are linked through two and three covalent 
bonds, respectively. We found that the manipulation of the 
molecular conformation of PDI dimers through changing the 
connection mode has pronounced effects on the electronic, 
optical, and electrochemical properties. The highly twisted mol-
ecule, d-gdiPDI, exhibited a superior volumetric capacitance 
of 657 F cm−3 relative to that of the almost planar d-gdiPDI  
(261 F cm−3), and also gave a charge-storage capacity of 479 F g−1 
at a current density of 1 A g−1. The higher capacity of d-gdiPDI 
could be associated with its more hydrophilic character as well 
as the molecular contortion facilitating the ion intercalation/
transport. Note that the volumetric capacitance of d-gdiPDI is 
the highest value reported to date for small molecule OECT 
materials. Furthermore, when employed as the active channel 
of n-type OECTs, d-gdiPDI presented a much higher gm,norm of 
105.3 mS cm−1, compared with that of 55.5 mS cm−1 obtained 
from t-gdiPDI counterpart. Moreover, an impressive normalized 
transconductance of 142.4 mS cm−1 was found for d-gdiPDI-
based solid-electrolyte OECTs, showing its promising applica-
tion in biosensors. Our work highlights the important role of 
twisting molecular conformation manipulation toward opti-
mizing the capacitance in aqueous media and thus improving 
the performance of electrochemical devices and demonstrates 
the bright future of hydrophilic IPAHs for high-performance 
n-type small-molecule OECTs and energy storage devices.
