Abstract: The ability to bridge ionic and electronic transport coupled with large volumetric ca-
pacitance renders organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) ideal candidates for bioelectronic
applications. Adopting ionic-liquid-based solid electrolytes extends their applicability and facilitates
large-area printable productions. However, OETCs employing solid electrolytes tend to show a pro-
nounced hysteresis in the transfer curve. A detailed understanding of the hysteresis is crucial for their
accurate characterizations and reliable applications. Here, we demonstrated fully photopatternable
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):tosylate (PEDOT:Tos)- based OECTs incorporating the ionic liquid
[EMIM][EtSO4] in a solid electrolyte (SE). The PEDOT:Tos ﬁlms deposited through vapor phase
polymerization (VPP) were annealed for different durations after the polymerization step. Upon
rinsing with ethanol and the deposition of the SE, the OECTs made of these ﬁlms showed impressive
bias stress stability under prolonged operation cycles, a high switching ratio, a low threshold voltage,
and a high transconductance. Furthermore, by taking transfer measurements with different sweep
rates, we revealed two distinct regimes of hysteresis: kinetic hysteresis and non-kinetic hysteresis.
We observed pronounced changes in these regimes after annealing. Finally, impedance spectroscopy
exhibited that the PEDOT:Tos turned from a Faradaic to a non-Faradaic response through annealing,
explaining the observed hysteresis changes in both regimes.

1. Introduction
Owing to their ability to transduce both electronic and ionic signals, organic electro-
chemical transistors (OECTs) are ideal candidates for bioelectronics [1,2], sensors [3,4], and
neuromorphic applications [5–8]. OECTs are three-terminal devices comprising an organic
mixed ionic electronic conductor (OMIEC) [9] as the channel between the source and drain
electrode. An electrolyte acts as the ion reservoir between the channel and gate electrode.
When the drain–source bias (VDS) is ﬁxed, a changing gate–source voltage (VGS) dictates
the ﬂow of the mobile ions between the OMIEC channel and the electrolyte. These ions, in
turn, change the doping states and the conductivity (ID) of the OMIEC channel [10]. As a
result, OECTs are volumetric devices, which grants them a high transconductance (high
ampliﬁcation), allowing them to operate at relatively low voltages [11].
Various conjugated polymers are suitable as the channel materials of OECTs [12]. One
polymer of particular interest that allows precision control over device properties is poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene):tosylate (PEDOT:Tos) [13,14]. A popular method to deposit PE-
DOT:Tos is vapor phase polymerization (VPP). Although various variations are possible [15],
VPP typically follows the routine of surface preparation by an oxidant, polymerization in

vacuum, post-polymerization annealing, and the removal of residuals. Traditionally, the
electrolyte used for gating incorporates water with salts (i.e., liquid electrolyte), which can
evaporate and contaminate easily and is inconvenient for all-printed applications. Ion gels, a
composite material comprising an ionic liquid in a complex polymer matrix [16] (also referred
to as solid electrolyte or SE), are printable [17], scalable [18], and photopatternable [19].
The typical ﬁgures of merit of OECTs, such as the transconductance, switching ratio,
and threshold voltage, are extracted from the transfer curve measurements. It has been
shown that OECTs employing an SE have a pronounced hysteresis in the transfer curves [19].
In other words, the device gives two sets of data depending on whether the transfer curve
measurement is taken from the ON to the OFF state and vice versa. Previous work has tried
to explore the origin of hysteresis from different perspectives where the explanations differ
signiﬁcantly. Kaphle et al. attributed hysteresis to an incomplete movement of ions [20],
which explains the change in hysteresis with changing gate–source voltage scan rates.
However, an ionic-movement-based explanation fails to explain a saturating hysteresis
(i.e., a hysteresis that sustains even for a sufﬁciently slow scan rate). Winther-Jensen et al.
argued that hysteresis could be adjusted by controlling the degree of polymer collapse by
modifying the concentration of polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) in the PEDOT:Tos blend [13].
Ji et al. later showed that such a change is instead connected to the trapping of cations
by PTHF [14]. However, none of these theories explain the presence of hysteresis in
PEDOT:Tos-based OECTs without any PTHF additive. Regardless of the explanations, it is
safe to assume that multiple factors might contribute to hysteresis in OECTs. In particular,
the inﬂuence of defect states on hysteresis remains elusive.
Here, we introduce a fully photopatternable PEDOT:Tos OECT employing a solid
electrolyte with [EMIM][EtSO4] as the ionic liquid. Contrary to conventional pattern-
ing via parylene peel-off, photolithography coupled with dry etching is cleaner and less
complex [21]. We annealed the deposited PEDOT:Tos ﬁlm for different durations before
washing it with ethanol. Upon residual removal from the deposited ﬁlms and SE deposition,
the resulting OECTs showed impressive bias stress stability under prolonged operation.
By varying the gate–source voltage (VGS) scan rate, we revealed two distinct regimes of
hysteresis distinguishable by their kinetics. We named them kinetic and non-kinetic hys-
teresis depending on whether they change by change in the VGS scan rate. We observed an
increasing kinetic hysteresis in the devices with increased thermal annealing. However, the
strength of the non-kinetic hysteresis and its onsets remain curious. From the impedance
measurements, we observed that PEDOT:Tos switched from a non-polarizable (Faradaic)
to a polarizable (non-Faradaic) behavior upon thermal annealing, explaining the evolution
of the hysteresis over different scan rates. We speculated that annealing caused a demixing
in PEDOT:Tos, causing ion trapping in the different phases of the material.
2. Materials and Methods
The sample fabrication and characterization were carried out in a cleanroom environ-
ment. The OETCs involved in this work were a side-gated planar electrode conﬁguration
utilizing a three-stage photolithography patterning process (see Figure 1a). A glass sub-
strate (1′′ × 1′′, 3 nm Cr and 50 nm Au) was spin-coated (60 s, 3000 rpm; Sawatec SM-180-BT,
Sax, Switzerland ) with the photoresist AZ 1518 (MicroChemicals GmbH, Ulm, Germany)
followed by baking on a hotplate (60 s, 110 °C; Sawatec HP-150, Sax, Switzerland). The illu-
mination of the electrode pattern ensued in a mask aligner (10 s, I-line 365 nm, 167 W; SÜSS
Microtec AG, Garching, Germany). The development of AZ 1518 (60 s, AZ 726 MIF; Micro-
Chemicals GmbH, Ulm, Germany) and etching of Au (60 s; 10% diluted aqueous; Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and Cr (20 s, 10% diluted aqueous; Merck KGaA,Darmstadt,
Germany), respectively, produced the desired electrode pattern on the glass substrate.
The second stage of photolithography started with the deposition of PEDOT:Tos. We
followed a five-step base-inhibited VPP process [22] with some modifications. First, the sub-
strate was spin-coated (15 s, 1500 rpm) with the reactants Fe(III):Tos (324 mg; Sigma Aldrich,
Taufkirchen Germany), pyridine (32 µL; Alfa Aesar, Karlsruhe, Germany), and butanol (1.6 mL;

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 5754
3 of 11
Acros Organics, Karlsruhe, Germany), followed by air drying for 30 min. The polymerization
was carried out in a desiccation chamber (Gebr. Rettberg GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). A
Petri dish containing EDOT (Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen Germany) was kept at the bottom
of the desiccation chamber, while the substrate containing the reactants was set on a stage.
The desiccation chamber was kept on a hotplate at 70 °C, which maintained the substrate
temperature at around 50 °C (VOLTCRAFT IR 500-12S, Hirschau, Germany). The desiccation
chamber was connected to a vacuum pump rated at 780 Pa. The equilibration time was 10 min,
and the polymerization time was 1 h. The post-polymerization thermal annealing was carried
out for 0, 1, and 4 h on a hotplate at 70 °C. Finally, the deposited PEDOT:Tos was carefully
dipped in ethanol to remove any residuals.
Next, the substrate with the electrode pattern and the deposited polymer was spin-
coated with an SL1 sacrificial layer (60 s, 3000 rpm; post-baking at 100 °C for 60 s; Orthogonal
Inc., Rochester, NY, USA) [21] and photoresist AZ nLOF 2020 (60 s, 3000 rpm; post-baking
at 110 °C for 60 s; MicroChemicals GmbH, Ulm, Germany). The illumination in the mask
aligner (14 s, I-line 365 nm, 167 W; SÜSS Microtec AG, Garching, Germany) and post-baking
followed (60 s, 110 °C). The resist was developed by AZ 726 MIF (60 s; MicroChemicals
GmbH, Ulm, Germany), and the unprotected sacrificial layer was removed by spin coating
(3000 rpm, increments of 15 s until undercut appeared) with HFE (3M Performance Chemicals,
Nordrhein-Westfalen Germany). The final PEDOT:Tos pattern on the gate and channel was
obtained by dry etching with oxygen plasma (300 s, 100 V bias, 50 W RF power, 30 Pa; Aurion
VPA-14-01, Seligenstadt, Germany). The crosslinked resist and underlying SL1 were removed
by keeping the substrate in the OSCoR Developer 103a (Orthogonal Inc.) overnight. The SE
pattern was achieved by the same method reported earlier [19].
The thickness measurements were taken using a proﬁlometer (Veeco Dektak 150,
Aschheim, Germany). All electrical and impedance measurements were carried in a N2
glovebox (MBraun, Garching Germany). The electrical measurements were taken with
two Keithley 236 SMUs (Oregon, United States) coupled with the software SweepMe!
(Dresden, Germany). The impedance measurements were taken with Metrohm Autolab
PGSTAT302N (Filderstadt, Germany) in the potentiostatic mode with an RMS amplitude of
10 mV and without any DC offset. The scan range was from 105 to 10−1 Hz, and the ﬁtting
was performed from 104 Hz (excluding the outliers at higher frequencies).

3. Results and Discussion
After polymerization in vacuum and before ethanol washing, the deposited PE-
DOT:Tos ﬁlms were annealed for 0, 1, and 4 h at 70 °C. Here, we report the preliminary
comparisons of our fabricated PEDOT:Tos ﬁlms and devices. Figure 1a shows a fabricated
device, and Figure 1b,c depict the corresponding chemical composition of the SE and
channel material, respectively. We observed an increasing ﬁlm thickness and decreasing
ﬁlm conductivity (see Appendix A.1 Figure A1) with increasing annealing time, in line with
the results of Zuber et al. [23]. According to this report, the ﬁlm thickness increased due to
further polymerization from the residuals, while the decreased conductivity (even with an

Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 5754

increased doping level) was explained by the branching out of polymers. A pronounced
hysteresis was noticeable in the transfer curves of the annealed devices. At a VGS scan rate
of 175 mV s−1, the 0, 1, and 4 h-annealed devices showed ON–OFF (ION, −1 V/IOFF, 1.25 V)
ratios of 2.50 × 104, 4.29 × 104, and 2.06 × 104; peak transconductances of 0.76, 0.66, and
0.26 mS; and threshold voltages of 0.31, 0.47, and 0.89 V, respectively (see Appendix A.2
Figure A2). The following section discusses the bias stress and ways to mitigate it. After
that, we depict the two regimes of hysteresis over the VGS scan rate in the 1 h-annealed
device as a demonstration. In the ﬁnal section, we evaluate the effect of post-polymerization
thermal annealing in PEDOT:Tos.
3.1. Bias Stress and Recovery
The conductivities of the polymers decreased slightly after depositing the SE, which
was indicative of partial polymer dedoping [24]. Therefore, we included a negative VGS
voltage during the transfer curve measurements. The transfer curve sweeping was typ-
ically carried out from −1.0 V to 1.25 V, then back to −1.0 V to scan the full switching
potential of the device (i.e., including complete dedoping and redoping of the polymer;
see Appendix A.3 Figure A3). A previous study showed that bias stress arose from the
incomplete movement of ions between the SE and polymer [20]. Therefore, if the VGS
scan rate (sweeping speed) is too slow or the VGS scan window is too large, then the bias
stress will not be visible. Moreover, the drain–source voltage (VDS) should also be small
enough to avoid current stress (see Appendix A.4 Figure A4). We performed ﬁve-hundred
successive transfer curve measurements (from purple to red gradient in Figure 2a). This
measurement, lasting for about 6 h, showed some bias stress effect in our device (i.e., the
shift of the transfer curves). Nevertheless, a recovery measurement after the bias stressing
indicated that the device completely recovered even after prolonged operation. The latter
reported measurements were taken after giving sufﬁcient pauses to avoid bias stress.

Figure 2. (a) Bias stress stability measurement in an OECT where the PEDOT:Tos ﬁlm is annealed
for 1 h at 70 °C. The measurement spans approximately six hours, with a recovery measurement
showing no evidence of device degradation. (b) Demonstration of a scan-rate-dependent transfer
curve measurement where the inlet shows the hysteresis strength ψ [19,25]. Such a measurement
reveals two distinct regimes of hysteresis, which we name kinetic hysteresis (blue gradients) or
non-kinetic hysteresis (orange gradients), depending on whether they change for a further reduction
of the scan rates. Kinetic hysteresis at higher scan rates is related to the incomplete movement of ions,
whereas non-kinetic hysteresis observed at lower scan rates results presumably from a combination
of multiple factors. The channel width W, length L, and gate distance g are 150 µm, 150 µm, and
50 µm, respectively. The ﬁlm thickness d for the bias stress measurement is 80 nm and for the scan-
rate-dependent measurement is 119 nm. The drain–source voltage (VDS) is kept constant at −0.2 V.
The scan speed for bias stress measurement is ≈180 mV s−1.

3.2. Regimes of Hysteresis
As the ions need to physically move to switch the device, the response time of the
OECTs to a change of the input signal VGS is typically large. The response time also
depends on parameters such as the ion mobility (conductivity of the electrolyte) or the
distance between the channel and gate [1]. Therefore, the shape of the transfer curve (and
the extracted parameters) depends closely on the VGS scan rate. We carried out a set of
measurements with a ﬁxed VGS step and different hold times to extract transfer curves with
varying VGS scan rates (in units of mV s−1). The gate voltage was set at −1 V for 15–30 s
before each transfer curve measurement to ensure that the polymer reached the maximum
conducting state. Holding VGS at the beginning of each measurement also acted as a pause,
allowing the cations to move completely out of the polymer to mitigate any bias stress
effect. Nevertheless, the duration of these measurements with different scan rates was
around 20 min, which is much shorter than the time scale on which we observed the bias
stress instability (see Appendix A.5 Figure A5).
Figure 2b depicts the scan-rate-dependent transfer curve measurements for the OECT
made from the 1 h-annealed PEDOT:Tos ﬁlm. We utilized the ψ parameter to represent
the hysteresis strength, which is the ratio of a pair of outputs ID to the same input VGS,
integrated over the hysteresis window [19] (see Figure 2b inlet). The ψ parameter indicated
that the hysteresis saturated at a scan rate of ≈85 mV s−1 for the 1 h-annealed devices. We
assumed that the kinetic hysteresis observable under a faster scan rate was indeed due to
the incomplete movement of the ions, as shown earlier [20]. However, the nature of the
inner non-kinetic hysteresis at lower scan rates was not trivial.
3.3. Effect of Thermal Annealing on Hysteresis
We report the scan-rate-dependent measurements for OECTs where the PEDOT:Tos was
annealed for 0, 1, and 4 h. In Figure 3a–c, we show the transfer curves for different scan rates
and annealing durations. Figure 3d shows the hysteresis strength ψ for these devices as a
function of the scan rate. We observed a direct correlation between hysteresis strength and
annealing time for a fixed VGS scan rate in the kinetic hysteresis regime. For example, at a
scan rate of 175 mV s−1, the 0, 1, and 4 h-annealed devices showed a ψ value of 2.17, 2.93, and
7.42 V, respectively. However, the devices behaved curiously in the non-kinetic hysteresis
regime. Firstly, the non-kinetic hysteresis for the non-annealed device (0 h) was significantly
lower (ψ = 0.51 V) than for the annealed devices, where ψ reached a value of approximately
3 V (note that ψ is a logarithmic quantity and, hence, the difference between the annealed
and non-annealed devices was very large). Secondly, the non-kinetic hysteresis for the 1 and
4 h-annealed devices were almost similar at around ψ = 3 V, indicating that the effect of
annealing was almost complete after 1 h. Finally, the onset of the non-kinetic hysteresis did
not show any specific dependence on the scan rate (e.g., the onset of non-kinetic hysteresis
for the 0, 1, and 4 h-annealed devices were at 9.82, 85.1, and 7.05 mV s−1, respectively). This
aspect reflected the situation that the transition from the non-kinetic to the kinetic hysteresis
was governed by the time constant of ion movement, which may depend significantly on the
thickness and conductivity of the solid electrolyte.

Figure 3. (a–c) Scan rate-dependent transfer curve measurements for OECTs where the PEDOT:Tos
ﬁlm is annealed for 0, 1, and 4 h, respectively. (d) Hysteresis strength ψ plotted against the scan
rates. The kinetic hysteresis strengths (at higher scan rates) increase with increasing annealing time.
Non-kinetic hysteresis appears fastest in the 1 h-annealed ﬁlm. Further, the 1 and 4 h-annealed devices
show similar non-kinetic hysteresis (ψ ≈3 V), whereas the non-annealed device shows rather small
non-kinetic hysteresis (ψ = 0.51 V). Here, W, L, g = 150 µm, 150 µm, 50 µm; VD = −0.2 V; the ﬁlm
thicknesses for 0, 1, 4 h annealing are 103, 119, 141 nm, respectively.
We performed impedance spectroscopy to gain more insight into the two regimes
of hysteresis. Typically, the ionic circuit of an OECT is represented by a series circuit of
a resistor and capacitors. The resistor accounts for the electrolyte resistance, while the
capacitors represent the gate electrolyte and channel electrolyte interfaces. The capacitance
of the gate is usually signiﬁcantly larger and, hence, negligible in the series connection.
One can also include a resistor parallel to the capacitor to include Faradaic processes. The
ideal capacitor is a simpliﬁcation, and usually, more complex models need to be used to
describe all possible processes (e.g., accounting for different types of ions, their velocity
distribution [4], and the non-uniformity of the electrode materials). Furthermore, the
description of the electrode by means of a resistor is a simpliﬁcation, as diffusion in an
electrolyte is in general described by a Warburg element (behaving like a resistor at very
low frequency and absorbing boundaries [26]).
Figure 4 depicts the impedances (source and drain at the same potential and impedance
measured to the gate) of all the annealed devices, with the ﬁtting circuit contained as inlets.
For non-annealed devices (0 h), the impedance of the channel is mainly described by a
pure resistor representing a Faradaic electrode with a capacitive contribution at only a
very low frequency (presumably originating from the Warburg element describing the
ion migration in the electrolyte). Therefore, it will mostly show kinetic hysteresis (the
higher the sweep rate, the stronger the hysteresis is), which is in line with our observations.
Moreover, the contribution of the capacitance to the impedance was small, and hence, the
kinetic hysteresis was predicted to be the smallest for the non-annealed devices.
If the devices were annealed (1, 4 h), the impedance response transformed into the
response of a constant phase element (CPE). For the 1 h-annealed device, an additional
capacitor was required with the CPE to capture the response. The C and CPE in series
imply that only the electrostatic process is there at the beginning. Thus, the electronic–ionic
coupling would happen via the same states, but, e.g., the energies of these states change
upon annealing, making a Faradaic process possible. With increasing annealing time, the
slope in the Bode plot increased, meaning that the electrode was becoming more capacitive
(hence, the kinetic hysteresis of the 4 h device will be the strongest). However, the change
from a Faradaic to non-Faradaic response explains the different strength of the kinetic
hysteresis at high scan rates; still, it does not explain the origin of the non-kinetic hysteresis
at low scan rates. The pronounced non-kinetic hysteresis (ψ ≈3 V) only occurred in the
device with a capacitive character, while the non-annealed device was primarily resistive
and only showed very low non-kinetic hysteresis (ψ = 0.51 V), the origin of which still

remains elusive. The CPE in the impedance spectra tells us that the annealed PEDOT:Tos
devices possessed a distribution of states at the interface between the electrolyte and the
OMIEC, which is possibly connected to the appearance of the non-kinetic hysteresis. This
transition in the impedance response of the PEDOT:Tos ﬁlm is connected to the annealing-
induced polymerization. We speculated that this polymerization process might trigger
a demixing of the two components (PEDOT and Tos), similar to PEDOT:PSS [27], where,
e.g., PSS-rich domains might act as deep trap states (as described by the CPE). However, to

Figure 4. Impedance measurements of OECTs employing PEDOT:Tos ﬁlms annealed for 0, 1, 4 h.
The corresponding ﬁtting circuits and parameters are given as insets.
The non-annealed de-
vice shows mostly a Faradaic response, which changes to non-Faradaic responses after anneal-
ing.
The phase also indicates that the capacitances rapidly increase upon annealing.
Here,
W, L, g = 150 µm, 150 µm, 50 µm; the thicknesses are 103, 119, 141 nm for thermal annealing of 0, 1, 4 h,
respectively (a–c). The measurements were taken in potentiostatic mode with the source and drain
shorted, with an RMS amplitude of 10 mV and without any DC offset. The instabilities around the
50 Hz range probably originate due to the non-standard cables connecting the measurement setup
inside the glovebox to the standard Autolab cables situated outside the glovebox.
4. Summary
In this work, we demonstrated a fully photopatternable PEDOT:Tos OECT showing
excellent bias stress stability, and we adopted a scan-rate-dependent measurement scheme
to illustrate the kinetic and non-kinetic hysteresis. A strong enhancement of both could
be revealed by thermal annealing, and we utilized impedance analysis to explain the
changes in the two hysteresis regimes upon annealing. PEDOT:Tos was presumably well-
mixed for non-annealed samples (all states were equivalent and had no dopant-rich or
-poor domains), showing Faradaic behavior. Annealing fostered further polymerization of
PEDOT, which might cause the demixing of PEDOT and Tos [23], showing a non-Faradaic
behavior. Similar to PEDOT:PSS, ions might become trapped (represented by a CPE),
causing an increased capacitance [27].
This work illustrated that PEDOT:Tos ﬁlms employing solid electrolytes could be
viable for applications where reliable long operation cycles are desired. A VGS scan-rate-
dependent measurement scheme captured the effects of the changing material properties
on the device performances. This work further illustrated a simple process modiﬁcation
in thermal annealing to achieve varying hysteresis levels without changing the starting
material, suitable for neuromorphic applications utilizing hysteresis [13,14]. While this
work clearly distinguished between the non-kinetic and kinetic regimes of hysteresis, the
true origin of the non-kinetic hysteresis remains open for investigation. In particular,
further studies on micro- and nano-scale changes in PEDOT:Tos ﬁlms upon annealing will

provide valuable insights. If deep defects indeed cause the observed changes in hysteresis,
annealing could pave the way to quantify and assess the effect of defect states on the
OECTs’ properties.

Figure A5. (a) Initial and ﬁnal measurements for scan-rate-dependent measurement scheme for
1 h annealed device. A recovery measurement depicts that the device can switch between different
regimes of hysteresis when the bias stress is avoided by providing pauses. (b) A thirty-loop saturating
hysteresis measurement for the 4 h-thermally annealed ﬁlm showing impressive consistency. The
measurement duration is ≈7 h, with no visible bias stress as the scan speed for such a measurement
is signiﬁcantly slower. Here, the devices have dimensions of W, L, g = 150 µm, 150 µm, 50 µm;
VD = −0.2 V. The thicknesses are 119, 141 nm for thermal annealing of 1, 4 h, respectively.
