n-Type Organic Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductors for
Organic Electrochemical Transistors
Haojie Dai* and Wan Yue*
1. Introduction
Since the ﬁrst demonstration by Wrighton in 1984,[1] the organic
electrochemical transistor (OECT) has attracted extensive atten-
tion owing to low driving voltage (typically below 1 V), ultra-high
ion sensitivity and excellent current ampliﬁcation.[2] These excep-
tional characteristics render the technology versatile for various
applications in electronics, especially bioelectronics[3]; past
research from industry and academia have demonstrated
OECTs being employed in cellular activity monitoring,[4] ion
sensors,[5] printed logic circuitry,[6] biomolecule detectors,[7]
and as neural recording components,[8] etc.
The key component of an OECT is the channel (active) mate-
rial, which is an organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor
(OMIEC), that conducts both electronic and ionic charges within
the entire volume of the channel and modulates its redox states
and conductivity via interactions with ions
and solvent molecules of electrolytes.
Channel materials are organic semicon-
ductors (OSCs) that can be rationally
designed to ﬁne-tune their energy levels,
opto-electronic properties, and thus device
performance, allowing facile deduction of
structure–property
relationships.[9]
They
are lightweight, robust, and ﬂexible, and
can be processed by a variety of large-area
techniques. The mechanical ﬂexibility and
biocompatibility of organic molecules ren-
der them potential candidates for interfac-
ing biological systems (e.g., cells and
tissues).[10]
Channel materials are generally catego-
rized as p-type (for hole transportation)
or
n-type
(for
electron
transportation)
according to the charge carrier polarity.
The performance of OECTs has improved
ﬂeetingly over the past decade, with μC*
(the ﬁgure of merit for benchmarking OECT channel materials,
vide
infra)
for
p-type
exceeding
2000 F cm1 V1s1.[11]
However, the overall development of n-type OMIECs has consis-
tently lagged behind their p-type analogues, with highest μC*
reaching 180 F cm1 V1 s1.[12] Developing n-type materials
with comparable performance as that of p-type is paramount
in assembling complementary logic circuits with low static power
consumption, facilitating the development of fast and complex
circuits with enhanced stability.[13] Furthermore, certain biologi-
cal activities, such as cationic movements in/out of a cell,[14]
glucose oxidation,[15] etc., are better monitored with n-type
biosensors, which require adequate n-type OMIECs.
Systematic progress in material development/engineering is
best guided by a fundamental understanding of structure-
property relationships. To meet these requirements and facilitate
the development of new n-type OMIECs, this article evaluates
n-type OMIECs reported to date with emphasis on the underly-
ing structure-property relationships, from which molecular
design strategies hopefully can be subtly deduced. In addition,
the operational stability of channel materials and the applications
of n-type OECTs will also be discussed in passing, offering a
comprehensive view of the ﬁeld.
1.1. Working Principles of OECTs
An OECT device features a three-terminal architecture that is
composed of a gate, a source, and a drain electrode; in between
the source and the drain electrode there is the channel layer,
which is an OMIEC that conducts both electronic and ionic

n-Type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are fundamental building
blocks of biosensors and complementary circuits along with p-type. Yet, their
development has been lagging behind their p-type counterparts since ﬁrst
emergence in 2016. The key component of an OECT is the channel material,
which is an organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor (OMIEC), that dictates the
function and performance of the OECT via interactions with electrolyte ions.
OMIECs of OECTs are benchmarked by the product of charge-carrier mobility (μ)
and volumetric capacitance (C*), μC*. Signiﬁcant progress is made for
the development of novel n-type OMIECs, with best μC* now reaching
180 F cm1 V1 s1. This review elucidates such material development progress
of n-type OMIECs with emphases on the underlying molecular design strategies
and structure-property relationships. Furthermore, the operational stability of
channel materials and the applications of n-type OECTs are also discussed to
offer readers a comprehensive view of the ﬁeld. Finally, current limitations are
discussed along with outlook.

charges (Figure 1 middle). Gold is typically used to construct the
source and the drain electrode, as it has good ambient stability
and large work function (≈5 eV), which facilitates charge injec-
tion.[16] As for the gate electrode, non-polarizable Ag/AgCl pellets
are typically employed, whereby the voltage drop across the gate–
electrolyte interface is mitigated to ensure the main voltage
passes through the channel–electrolyte interface instead.[17]
The gate electrode is immersed in an electrolyte that is in direct
contact with the channel material and is rich in mobile ions.[18]
For biological applications aqueous-based electrolytes are gener-
ally preferred, even though electrolytes can be either solid or liq-
uid, organic or aqueous.[19] When an OECT device is in
operation, a potential difference is applied between the source
and the drain electrode (VD); as a result, an electric current
(ID) then drives through the channel material. An input voltage
at the gate electrode (VG) modulates the magnitude of the current
by managing the injection of ions, “doping”, from the electrolyte
into the channel material. Notably, the ionic–electronic coupling
processes occur over the entire channel volume, which is an
identifying and distinct characteristic of an OECT, as opposed
to a thin interfacial electrical double layer as seen in organic
ﬁeld-effect transistors (OFETs) (Figure 1 left). Thus, large mod-
ulations in the drain current can be gained for low-gate voltage.
This high transconductance feature allows OECTs to be used as
efﬁcient switches and robust ampliﬁers.[20] The level of doping of
the channel material at zero gate bias determines the operation
mode of the device. For a device operating in depletion mode, the
semiconductor is doped at zero gate bias (and is therefore in its
ON state); applying a gate bias switches the device OFF. Whereas
for a device that operates in accumulation/enhancement mode,
the semiconductor is undoped at zero gate bias, applying a gate
bias switches the device ON, exactly opposite of that of the deple-
tion mode. From energy consumption perspective, accumulation
mode is generally preferred.
An n-type accumulation mode OECT is normally in the OFF
state owing to the small number of mobile electrons in the chan-
nel with very low conductivity. Applying a positive gate voltage
causes injection of cations into the channel along with a corre-
sponding accumulation of electrons (electrochemical doping in
the language of electrochemistry), turning the device ON with
enhanced conductivity (Figure 1 right).
Transconductance (gm) is the ﬁgure of merit of OECTs; it
measures the extent to which an OECT can amplify an input sig-
nal. Transconductance can be extracted from the partial deriva-
tive of transfer curve (gm =
∂
ID/
∂
VG) and is dependent upon
both channel geometry and biasing conditions. Bernards
et al.[21] reported Equation (1) for modelling OECTs working
in depletion mode; it denotes gm in the saturation regime as
gm ¼ dW
L μCðVth  VGÞ
(1)
where μ is the charge-carrier mobility, C* is the volumetric capac-
itance, and Vth is the threshold voltage; d, W and L are the chan-
nel geometry parameters representing thickness, width, and
length, respectively. Some articles used thickness normalized
gm (g0
m ¼ gm=d) to compare different device performances, while
others preferred geometry normalized gm (gm,norm = gmL/dW)
instead. Both have their grounds, but inevitably they have made
cross-comparisons difﬁcult.[22] A ﬁgure of merit that is more
relevant to the intrinsic properties of the channel material is
the product of charge carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance
(μC*), which considers the device geometry, VG and Vth. It can be
deduced from gm using Equation (1) and allows direct compari-
son of different materials. Therefore, μC* has since been used to
benchmark various OECT channel materials.[23] Alongside the
gm and μC*, variables such as OECT current on–off ratios,
switching time, and stability shall also be taken into account
for a more complete view of OECT performance. Switching
time/transient response of an OECT correlates to multiple fac-
tors, such as ion migration rate, charge-transport mobility,
and ﬁlm thickness.[24] Fast ion migration and efﬁcient charge
transport contribute to a swift transient response. However, thick
ﬁlms tend to impede response speed as they hinder the migra-
tion of ions. In this review, μC*s will be the focus and they will be
quoted preferentially.

environments; 2) having high effective electron mobility and
ionic capacity; and 3) fast cation insertion/transport during
electrochemical doping process.
Since the channel materials of OECT devices typically operate
in aqueous media, water and oxygen can act as electron traps to
impede device performance. Majority n-type organic semicon-
ductors have electrochemical windows that overlap with the
reduction potentials of water and oxygen.[26] Thermodynamic sta-
bility of n-type materials toward redox reactions involving water
and oxygen is typically dictated by lowest unoccupied molecular
orbitals (LUMOs). It is common nowadays for scientists, when
designing new materials, to aim for LUMO levels of lower (more
negative) than –4 eV in order to attain kinetic stability in ambient
conditions.[26,27] Therefore, it is intuitive to aim for LUMO levels
as low as possible, with electron-deﬁcient conjugated cores being
preferentially favored. Nevertheless, low-lying LUMOs facilitate
electron doping from donor sites, inevitably reducing the devices’
ON-OFF ratios. The former requires a depressed LUMO,
whereas the latter is mitigated with a lifted LUMO. A delicate
balance needs to be reached between the two. However, the
former has been by far the most challenging, and costing
organic
electronics
community
most
of
the
efforts.
The
common molecular design strategies to achieve sufﬁciently
depressed LUMOs are functionalizing the molecular/polymeric
conjugated cores with strong electron-withdrawing groups,
which include –CN (cyano-), –CO–NR–CO– (imide), –F (ﬂu-
oro-), –C(═O)OR– (ester), –Cl (chloro-), –C(═O)NR– (amide),
perﬂuoroarenes, and perﬂuroalkyls[27a,28]; and incorporating
electron deﬁcient heterocycles such as azines and azoles.[27c]
They are deduced from OFETs. Nevertheless, the strategies
can
be
regarded
as
being
independent
of
applications.
Therefore, they are equally applicable to OECTs. Of those strate-
gies, perﬂuoroarenes and perﬂuroalkyls have not been demon-
strated for OECTs.
As OMIECs of OECTs are typically benchmarked by μC*, any
strategies that would enhance both parameters, i.e., electron
mobility and volumetric capacitance, are favored. Yet, a trade-
off between the two is commonly observed, because the generic
strategies for enhancing each parameter are often conﬂicting.
Volumetric charging is generally realized via the incorporation
of solubilizing hydrophilic sidechains, such as polar oligo(ethy-
lene glycol) (OEG) chains, which induce swelling in aqueous
media and is detrimental to charge transport. Volumetric capaci-
tance is deduced from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS). The mixed ionic and electronic conduction of the channel
layers render the OECT capacitance greatly depend on the
channel structures. Generally, high density polar and hydrophilic
OEG sidechains of the channel materials would encourage ions
uptake from aqueous electrolyte, resulting high C*.[29] Molecular
backbone conformation also has an important role to determine
the C*.[30] A planar backbone with close π–π stacking between
neighbouring molecules, thus a crystalline domain, is generally
favored for charge transport; the close π–π stacking would
preclude ions
from
effectively
penetrating into
the bulk
of the channel, lowering volumetric capacitance. More details
of the interplay between the two parameters via close examina-
tion
of
structure-property
relationships
are
presented
in
Section 2 .
1.3. General Synthetic Methods of n-Type OMIECs for OECTs
Synthetic methods are also very important to the development of
next-generation n-type OMIECs for high-performing and highly
stable OECTs. Before 2021, all the n-type donor-acceptor
OMIECs based on naphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-diimide
(NDI), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), and bithiophene imide
(BTI) have been prepared by metal-catalyzed polymerization,
such as Stille and Suzuki polymerization. Although they are
highly
efﬁcient
and
robust,
their
synthetic
comonomer
precursors typically require multistep syntheses with hazardous
conditions. In addition, the residual metal impurities after poly-
merization are detrimental to devices’ performance.[11] For exam-
ple, as OECTs typically operate in ambient conditions, oxygen
can be reduced to toxic hydrogen peroxide by residual palladium,
rending the OMIECs unsuitable for biosensor applications.[31] To
facilitate biocompatibility and safe bioelectronics, chemists need
to consider alternative sustainable and green approaches.[32]
Recently, metal-free aldol condensation has been successfully
demonstrated during the syntheses of various fused n-type poly-
meric, small molecular, and oligomeric OMIECs.[33] Particularly,
the aldol
condensation
represents
a
low-cost,
sustainable
approach without using any expensive metals, and produces
water as the only by-product. Aldol poly(condensation) reactions
typically feature lactone/lactam rings joining together via C═C
bond with the entire structure showing rigid rod-like motif,
which
is
beneﬁcial
for
electronic
conduction
pathway.
Furthermore, the aldol condensation also provides an alternative
approach
to
n-type
donor-acceptor
isatin-based
polymeric
OMIECs, where the comonomers have been connected with
single bond.[34] Aside from aldol condensation, metal-free trans-
esteriﬁcation-type polymerization and oxidative polymerization
have also been utilized during the preparation of high-
performing n-type polymeric OMIECs in OECTs.[12,35]
2. n-Type OMIECs
2.1. Polymeric OMIECs
Most n-type OMIECs are polymers that offer advantages such as
strong ﬁlm-forming ability, robust mechanical ﬂexibility and
stretchability. They can be processed via large-area processing
techniques, allowing high-throughput and low-cost fabrications.

sized where the OEG sidechains attached to the 3, 3 0-position

bandgap with a higher-lying HOMO and a deeper-lying LUMO
than that of the p(gNDI-T2), with its LUMO sitting at 4.12 eV.
This later was translated to exceptional stability during OECT
demonstration. When the material was tested for OECT, the
device was able to undergo a two-hour continuous operation
without any degradation in current. A g0
m of ≈0.11 S cm1 for
p(gNDI-gT2) was deduced from relevant best device measure-
ments. Nevertheless, p(gNDI-T2) was not a potential candidate
for OECTs because of low currents.
Two years later (2018), the group then reported another P
series donor-acceptor random copolymers featuring the same
NDI-T2 core[29b]; the polymers (P-0 to P-100) have different glycol
sidechain percentages relative to branched alkyl sidechains
(Figure 2b). Increasing glycol percentage increases the hydrophi-
licity (and thus swelling) of the corresponding polymers in aque-
ous media, therefore facilitating ion uptake and allowing ions to
penetrate further/deeper into the bulk during electrochemical
redox reactions. This is also accompanied with lowering of the
charge injection barrier that decreases turn on voltage, with
P-100 having the smallest Vth in the series. As a result, the
polymers presented different n-type characteristics when being
placed in aqueous electrolytes for OECT measurements. A

signiﬁcant drop in electron mobility was also observed as alkyl
chains were replaced by glycol sidechains. Glycol sidechain per-
centage of >50% (i.e., P-75, P-90, P-100) was required to realize
volumetric charging. Of the seven copolymers, P-90 was the best
candidate with a g0
m of 0.21 S cm1, and an OECT electron mobil-
ity of 2.38  104 cm2 V1 s1. P-100 following as a second with
a g0
m of 0.20 S cm1 and an OECT electron mobility of
1.96  104 cm2 V1 s1. The metrics are rather similar. If there
is a key message of material design/structure-property relation-
ship to be taken away from this study and that may be applicable
to other future works, that is in aqueous media alkyl sidechains
favor electrons whereas glycol sidechains favor ions; controlling
the relative ratio of the two can impact the extent to which ions
can penetrate into the bulk of polymer during electrochemical
doping. P-90 attracted signiﬁcant attention of other research
groups, OECT devices incorporating P-90 have been demon-
strated for a number of bioelectronic applications.[15,37]
The work of P-90 series elucidated the key structure-property
relationship of sidechains. Nonetheless, there is an issue when it
comes to the synthesis of the P-90; as it is a random copolymer,
its reproduction is difﬁcult with large batch-to-batch varia-
tions.[38] To tackle such issue, the group then went back to
the donor-acceptor copolymer p(gNDI-gT2) and optimized it
by incorporating alkyl spacers in between the OEG sidechain
and the NDI core. Propyl- (C3) and hexyl- (C6) spacer were incor-
porated in between the NDI core and the OEG sidechain
(Figure 2c). The alkyl spacer and the OEG sidechain were
attached together via an ester linkage. It is worth mentioning that
the NDI comonomers were puriﬁed via GPC, as normal silica
column chromatography using methanol-containing eluent leads
to transesteriﬁcation.
All three polymers had about eight repeating units. Their
HOMOs and LUMOs lie around 5.1 and 4.0 eV, respectively.
The thin ﬁlms of the three polymers exhibited mixed edge on and
face on crystallites, which are comparable to previously reported
NDI-T2 analogues.[29b,39] The introduction of alkyl spacers
enhances electron mobility with a decrease in volumetric capaci-
tance, with p(C6-gNDI-gT2) displaying the highest μC* of
0.16 F cm1V1s1 overall (entry 1–3, Table 1).
The alkyl spacers also improved the operational stability of the
polymers in aqueous media, as the drain currents of both p(C3-
gNDI-gT2) and p(C6-gNDI-gT2) did not deteriorate during a two-
hour operation; the drain current of p(C3-gNDI-gT2) even
increased over the period, probably due to structural reorganiza-
tion that facilitates electronic charge transport.
Inal et al. did a comprehensive study of sidechain engineering
on NDI-T2-based copolymers.[40] The group ﬁrst focused
on attaching various substituents on the T2 unit, ranging from
methoxy groups (p(C4-T2-OMe)) to tetrameric OEGs with a -
C2H4- alkyl spacer (p(C4-T2-C4-EG)), while maintaining the same
sidechain on the NDI core (Figure 2d). Introducing the substitu-
ents on the T2 unit disrupts molecular orderings in the solid state
and is therefore detrimental to charge transport. p(C4-T2), the
unsubstituted T2 polymer, therefore, has the best performance
on account of the highest mobility while being demonstrated as a
channel material for OECTs (entry 4–8, Table 1). From that, the
group then did further sidechain engineering on the NDI unit by
incorporating alkyl spacers of various lengths, ranging from
Table 1. OECT performance metrics of some NDI-based polymeric OMIECs.

a two-carbon spacer (p(C2-T2)) to an eight-carbon spacer
(p(C8-T2)); the strategy is comparable to that of the p(C6-
gNDI-gT2) series. The general outcome is also akin to that of
the p(C6-gNDI-gT2) series; introducing alkyl spacers leads to
enhanced electron mobility, with the best candidate being
p(C6-T2) (entry 8–11, Table 1).
By varying the composition and distribution of hybrid (alkyl
and OEG) chains, the best performance can thus be obtained
with optimal swelling in aqueous media. Any sidechain engi-
neering strategy readers come across in literature can be boiled
down to this. Therefore, for the remaining of this review, the
focus will be on backbone engineering.
Following the sidechain engineering on NDI-T2-based copoly-
mers, McCulloch et al. then shifted their focus to backbone engi-
neering; two donor-acceptor copolymers, P4gNDI and P4gNDTI,
were reported (Figure 3a).[30a] The structural difference between
the two polymers resides on the acceptor NDI moiety, with
P4gNDTI having two additional ﬂanking thiophenes annulated
to it.
P4gNDTI has signiﬁcantly higher molecular weight than that
of P4gNDI. The authors claimed that due to aggregation in solu-
tion for P4gNDTI, the molecular weight was most likely overes-
timated, and it was not going to be a large contributing factor to
any difference in charge transport properties and overall device
performance. Such claim is debatable and no further evidence of
molecular weight measurements such as MALDI-TOF was
given. P4gNDTI has narrower bandgap with a more depressed
LUMO level (–4.17 vs –4.04 eV for P4gNDI), which facilitates
electronic charge injection. This is reﬂected in the subsequent
OECT testing with P4gNDTI showing smaller Vth (entry 12
and 13, Table 1). The extended conjugation results in backbone
co-planarity that is favorable for electronic charge transport, with
P4gNDTI displaying an electron mobility that is more than two
orders of magnitude higher than that of P4gNDI. Increasing
electron mobility is accompanied with a concomitant reduction
in volumetric capacitance as a result of close π-π stacking, which
precludes hydrated ions from effectively penetrating into the
bulk of the polymer. The authors also did shelf-life stability tests
of the two polymers. Each polymer was stored in ambient air and
tested weekly for 4 weeks. P4gNDTI was able to maintain its per-
formance through the entire test duration, whereas its NDI coun-
terpart experienced noticeable degradation. Further short-term
ON-OFF switching stability tests also favored P4gNDTI for it
being able to maintain 94% of its initial drain current.
Whereas for P4gNDI, its low ON current renders it impractical
for the test. This work demonstrates that structural engineering
toward planar backbone for enhanced charge transport with close
π–π stacking is a viable strategy to boost OECT performance.
For donor-acceptor copolymers, LUMO electrons are typically
localized on the acceptor units.[41] Reducing donor strength can
promote the LUMO electron delocalization across the entire
molecular backbone, thus enhancing electron mobility. Yue
et al.[42] demonstrated a proof of principle of such strategy by
ﬂuorinating the bithiophene unit of the NDI-T2 core to offer
gNDI-FBT. For comparison, gNDI-EDBT and gNDI-BT were also
prepared (Figure 3b). The three polymers have different donor
strengths, with EDBT being the strongest and FBT being the
weakest. Of the three polymers, gNDI-FBT exhibited the best per-
formance as a channel material of OECTs, with the highest
electron mobility and the largest volumetric capacitance, which
is due to facile ion migration as a consequence of ﬂuorination
(entry 14–16, Table 1). Furthermore, as response speed is
correlated to ion migration and ﬂuorination promotes fast ion
migration/insertion, gNDI-FBT also has the shortest response
time (τON/τOFF of 46/27 ms vs 378/63 ms and 102/31 ms for
gNDI-EDBT and gNDI-BT, respectively). Very recently, the group
introduced gNDI-V and gNDI-T,[43] which feature glycolated NDI
polymerized
with
vinylene
and
thiophene,
respectively
(Figure 3c). gNDI-V outperforms gNDI-T for OECT demonstra-
tion, with electron mobility that is one order of magnitude higher
(entry 17 and 18, Table 1). The authors ascribed that to the hydro-
gen bonding between vinyl hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen on the
NDI, which enhances backbone co-planarity that is favorable for
charge transport. Such explanation may be partially true, but a
more plausible explanation lies within the fact that vinylene pre-
fers planar conformation and is a lot less bulky than thiophene.
Therefore, it facilitates aggregation in the solid state with close
contacts.
An alternative means to reducing donor strength other than
ﬂuorination as seen for gNDI-FBT is replacing carbon atoms
with electronegative heteroatoms, such as nitrogen. van de
Burgt et al.[44] demonstrated this strategy by replacing the bithio-
phene of NDI-T2 with bithiazoles to offer PNDI2OD-2Tz,
PNDIODTEG-2Tz and PNDI2TEG-2Tz (Figure 3d). Due to
hydrophobic alkyl sidechains, only PNDI2TEG-2Tz was success-
fully demonstrated as an OECT channel material. PNDI2TEG-
2Tz exhibited a μC* of 1.16 F cm1 V1 s1 with an electron
mobility of 3.16  103 cm2 V1 s1 (entry 19, Table 1).
Interlude: Certain OECT applications rely on factors such as
mobility, swelling, and stability, etc., to function rather than high
OECT performance. Inal et al. attached a unique lysine derivative
(L2) to NDI-T2 backbone to form polymer p(NDI-T2-L2)
(Figure 3e), which is speciﬁcally designed for lipid membrane
interfacing.[14] The lysine chains on the polymer ﬁlm surface ori-
ented in a way such that they facilitated zwitterionic lipid vesicles
assembling into supported lipid bilayers.[45] The best OECT
device of p(NDI-T2-L2) recorded a μC* of 0.31 F cm1V1s1,
which
is
modest
compared
to
state-of-the-art
materials.
Nonetheless,
such
performance
is
sufﬁcient
for
micro-
transistors of biosensors with remarkable operational stability.
The work of Inal et al. constitutes an important application-ori-
ented material design strategy that can be further exploited for
various applications.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-Based Polymers: Diketopyrrolopyrrole
(DPP) is a common organic building block that has been exten-
sively studied in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic light
emitting diodes (OLEDs), and OFETs.[46] The choice of sidechain
can greatly inﬂuence DPPs’ tendency to aggregate in the solid
state. Strong aggregation results in close intermolecular contacts
with high charge carrier mobility. Electron mobility as high as
5 cm2V1s1 has been reported for DPP-based OFET devices.[47]
Therefore, employing DPP as a building block of OMIECs to
improve the μ of μC* for n-type OECTs is a theoretically viable
strategy.
In 2020, Aetukuri et al.[48] used 2DPP-OD-TEG (Figure 4) for a
preliminary OECT demonstration. 2DPP-OD-TEG was ﬁrst
reported as an OFET channel material in 2012 with high charge
carrier mobility of 3 cm2V1s1.[49] The preliminary OECT

device testing showed a μC* of ≈2 Fcm1V1s1, which was the
best n-type at the time. Despite lacking further studies such as
stability tests, structure-property relationship investigations,
Aetukuri et al.’s work served as a proof of principle that DPP
is a promising building block for OECT channel materials. In
2021, the group further optimized the material and reported a
μC* of 6.8 F cm1 V1 s1.[25] The exact cause behind such
improvement is difﬁcult to justify as both processing conditions
and electrolytes have been modiﬁed with respect to the 2020’s
article. However, it is likely that the modiﬁed processing method
had positive effects on the molecular orderings of the ﬁlm that is
beneﬁcial for charge transport.
The majority of DPP-based OMIECs reported for OECTs are

be tuned n-type. P(gPzDPP-CT2) and P(gPzDPP-2T) are differ-
ent by cyano-groups at bithiophenes (Figure 4). The HOMO,
LUMO levels of the cyanated polymer are more depressed, owing
to the strong electron withdrawing cyano-groups. Lower-lying
LUMO facilitates electronic charge injection with P(gPzDPP-
CT2) showing smaller Vth (entry 1 and 2, Table 2). P(gPzDPP-
2T) is more hydrophilic with larger volumetric capacitance
(Table 2). However, the calculated OECT electron mobility of
P(gPzDPP-CT2) is one order of magnitude higher. This was
ascribed to a more planar backbone of the cyanated polymer,
the polaron of which also is more delocalized upon reduction.
From structure-property perspective, cyano-groups enhance
backbone coplanarity and facilitate electron delocalization.
This concurs with the outcome of f-BTI2g-TVTCN series
(vide infra). The response time of the OECT for each polymer
were similar when they were tested in different electrolytes
(aqueous
solutions
of
NaCl,
KCl,
NH4Cl),
suggesting
ionic mobility has little effect on the response speeds of the
devices; a rare example as response speed is typically propor-
tional to ionic mobility.

Later in the same year, Lei et al. reported that the ﬂuorination
of one of the donor thiophene moieties in p-type polymer
P(gTDPPT) (Figure 4) could cause a change in polarity, render-
ing the subsequent polymer, P(gTDPP2FT), n-type, accompanied
with noticeable depressing of both HOMO, LUMO levels.[52]
P(gTDPP2FT) features a planar backbone with an electron mobil-
ity of 0.35 cm2V1S1, and a μC* of 54.8 F cm1V1s1
(Table 2). In terms of stability, it was only able to retain 54%
of its initial drain current after six minutes on-off cycling meas-
urements in ambient conditions, which is poor compared to
NDI-based polymeric OMIECs. The authors then compared
the performance of P(gTDPP2FT) with P(gPyDPPT), where
the ﬂanking thiophene moieties were replaced with pyridines.
P(gPyDPPT) has poor OECT performance with a μC* of
0.07 F cm1V1s1. The speciﬁc values of μ and C* were not
reported. Through a series of computational simulations featur-
ing spin density distribution of the charged polymers and con-
formational dihedral angle study, the difference in performance
was ascribed to poor charge delocalization along the backbone
with a lack of coplanarity for P(gPyDPPT). Another important
point that is responsible for the high planarity and electron
mobility of P(gTDPP2FT) is the S–F cross-spatial interaction,
which is missing in the discussion of the article. The S–F
cross-spatial interactions have been proven to preserve backbone
planarity, which is crucial for charge transport and accessible
electrochemical redox reactions.[53]
Bithiophene Imide (BTI)-Based Polymers: Bithiophene-imide
(BTI) derivatives are promising candidates for synthesizing
n-type conjugated polymers; imide functionality renders the
building blocks electron deﬁcient with depressing of the
LUMOs; solubility tuning can be done via N-functionalization;
a fused planar backbone with minimal steric clash with neigh-
bouring (hetero)arenes after cross-coupling/polymerization is
beneﬁcial for electronic conduction pathways.[54] Past research
have shown high OFET electron mobilities of BTI-derived
polymers.[55]
In 2021, Guo et al.[56] reported two donor-acceptor copolymers,
f-BTI2TEG-T and f-BTI2TEG-FT (Figure 4). The polymers use
branched OEG sidechains to ensure sufﬁcient solubility for fur-
ther solution-processing capability. They are different by ﬂuorine
functionalities at the 3-, 4-position of the donor thiophene. OECT
device testing results showed that f-BTI2TEG-FT has better
performance with a μC* of 15.20 versus 2.3 F cm1V1s1
for f-BTI2TEG-T. The higher μC is a result of high volumetric
capacitance (entry 4 and 5, Table 2). Unlike other examples, such
as gAIID-2FT (Figure 5), where ﬂuorination has improved both
volumetric capacitance and electron mobility versus its non-
ﬂuorinated counterpart gAIID-T. Fluorination has only improved
volumetric capacitance for f-BTI2TEG-FT. So, why does ﬂuorina-
tion for gAIID-2FT results in improvements in both electron
mobility and volumetric capacitance, whereas for f-BTI2TEG-
FT it only results in improvement in volumetric capacitance?
A plausible explanation (we believe) lies in hydrophilicity;
gAIID-2FT is less hydrophilic than its non-ﬂuorinated counter-
part gAIID-T, whereas f-BTI2TEG-FT is more hydrophilic than
f-BTI2TEG-T. Therefore, f-BTI2TEG-FT shall swell more pro-
nounced than f-BTI2TEG-T in aqueous media. Swelling disrupts
electronic conduction pathway, yielding lower electron mobility
for f-BTI2TEG-FT than its non-ﬂuorinated counterpart. In the
original article, Guo et al. accredited lower electron mobility
of f-BTI2TEG-FT to its pristine ﬁlm of reduced crystallinity with
shorter crystal coherence length. It would be a lot better if mor-
phological studies of the ﬁlms after reduction in aqueous media
were also included. f-BTI2TEG-FT has signiﬁcantly higher
gm,norm (4.60 vs 0.27 S cm1 for f-BTI2TEG-T) with an ION/OFF
of 1.3  103 (vs 16.8 for f-BTI2TEG-T).
In 2022, the same group replaced the thiophene donors
of
f-BTI2TEG-T
series
with
thienylene-vinylene-thienylene
(TVT)-based moieties and offered f-BTI2g-TVT and f-BTI2g-
TVTCN.[57] The monomers of f-BTI2g-TVT and f-BTI2g-TVTCN
are different from each other by cyano-groups (Figure 4). Both
polymers were synthesized via Stille polymerization under iden-
tical experimental conditions, with f-BTI2g-TVT featuring much
longer chain length. Like that for P(gPzDPP-CT2), cyano-groups
also improve the electron mobility of f-BTI2g-TVTCN by enhanc-
ing backbone co-planarity and promoting close π–π stacking
(entry 6 and 7, Table 2). Owing to more efﬁcient ion doping,
f-BTI2g-TVTCN features slightly higher volumetric capacitance
than that of f-BTI2g-TVT, with both sharing similar hydrophilic-
ity. OECTs based on f-BTI2g-TVTCN showed an ION/OFF of 105,
which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of f-BTI2g-
TVT. The polymers showed reasonably good continuous opera-
tional stability in pulse-mode bias stress test with both being able
to retain ≈70% of their maximum currents after 40 min of
operation.
Isatin-Based Polymers: The majority of state-of-the-art n-type
semiconducting
polymers
are
donor-acceptor
copolymers,
synthesized via transition metal catalyzed polymerization. As a
result, each batch inevitably contains residual metallic species
that are detrimental to polymer performance in OECTs.[58]

One way of bypassing this issue is to use alternative polymeriza-
tion methods, such as acid catalyzed aldol polycondensation.
Chen et al.[59] reported two all-acceptor polymers, PgNaN and
PgNgN, which utilized bis-isatin-derived monomers that have
lactam as electron withdrawing units as parts of the rings
(Figure 5). Using all acceptor building blocks is another strategy
to promote LUMO electron delocalization across the entire
molecular backbone, comparable to reducing donor strength
as seen earlier. The polymerization reactions were conducted
using acid catalyzed aldol condensation, which is sustainable
and benign, successfully eliminating the use of organo-metallics
in comparison of traditional polymerization reactions catalyzed
by transition metals.[60] Structure-wise, the monomers can be
viewed as only differing by their sidechains, where the alkyl side-
chains (C12H25) of PgNaN were replaced with trimeric OEGs to
afford PgNgN, albeit the two polymers having notable differences
in molecular weights, with PgNgN having much shorter chain
length due to poor solubility. Owing to optimal hydrophobic/
hydrophilic balance with subdued swelling in aqueous media,
PgNaN is a better candidate as an OECT channel material
with a μC* of 0.662 versus 0.046 F cm1 V1 s1 for PgNgN.
Meanwhile, the C* for PgNgN was 239 F cm3 while PgNaN
showed much lower C* of 103 F cm3 owing to the 50% hydropho-
bic alkyl sidechain (Table 3). In 2022, the group reported another
series composed of six PgNaN derivatives[61]; the hydrophobic alkyl
sidechain was systematically varied from ethyl (p(g7NC2N)) to hex-
adecyl (p(g7NC16N)). The sidechain engineering strategy is akin to
that of the p(C4-T2) and p(C6-gNDI-gT2) series. The corresponding
OECT testing results are summarized in Table 4.
Yue et al.[34] used aldol polycondensation for polymerizing isa-
tin derivatives with bislactones to afford p(C-T), p(N-T), p(C-2T)
and p(C-g2T) (Figure 5). p(C-g2T) was poorly stable and was
excluded from further investigation. Of the rest three polymers,
p(C-T) and p(N-T) feature porous microstructures and are supe-
rior in performance than p(C-2T), such porous morphology was
postulated to maximize the electrolyte/polymer interface and
promote facile ion migration; both p(N-T) and p(C-T) have higher
volumetric capacitance than that of p(C-2T) (entry 3–5 Table 3).
Unlike the PgNaN series, the syntheses of the comonomers pre-
polymerization involve transition metal use, so the net metal use

is not free. Very recently, Inal et al. replaced the thiophene donor
comonomers of the p(C-2T) series with vinylene moieties to pro-
duce p(C-V) and p(C2F-V).[30b] The monomers of the two poly-
mers are differing by ﬂuorine groups at the acceptor isatin
moiety. Introducing vinylene donors signiﬁcantly enhanced
the backbone coplanarity of the polymers, such effect was further
compounded by H-bonding interaction between ﬂuorine and
vinyl hydrogen for p(C2F-V). Therefore, p(C2F-V) exhibited
closer π-π stacking and is more crystalline than p(C-V). This
translated to excellent electron mobility for p(C2F-V) when being
demonstrated for OECTs, with p(C2F-V) displaying an electron
mobility of 0.912 cm2 V1 s1, which is almost an order of mag-
nitude higher than that of p(C-V). Such mobility is also the high-
est reported to date for n-type OMIECs with solubilizing
sidechains, so is the μC* (entry 6 and 7, Table 3).
Isoindigos can be viewed as the dimer equivalent of isatins.
They are versatile electron-deﬁcient units for high-performance
organic
electronics.[62]
Nielsen
et
al.[63]
reported
AIG-BT
(Figure 5) as the ﬁrst n-type isoindigo-derived polymeric
OMIEC for OECTs. The material has a modest μC* of
0.12 F cm1 V1 s1. Later, Yue et al. reported gAIID-T and
gAIID-2FT.[64] Like gNDI-FBT, ﬂuorination results in improve-
ments in both electron mobility and volumetric capacitance
for gAIID-2FT (entry 9 and 10, Table 3) with a μC* of
4.09 F cm1V1 s1. In particular, ﬂuorine helps the polymer
take up less water without detrimentally affecting ion uptake.
In other words, it is more efﬁcient at ion uptake, probably
because ﬂuorine has electron lone pairs and is slightly negatively
charged that interacts strongly with cations. Furthermore, as
ﬂuorine promotes backbone coplanarity (through H-bonding
with aromatic H) that is beneﬁcial for charge transport,
gAIID-2FT has signiﬁcantly higher electron mobility compared
with its non-ﬂuorinated counterpart. gAIID-2FT exhibited excel-
lent operational stability and shelf-life, with no degradation in
performance at all after 3 h of continuous operation and 28 days
of storage in the air.
2.1.2. Ladder-Type Polymers
Poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL): BBL (Scheme 1a)
was ﬁrst reported in 1969,[35] and has been demonstrated for
OPVs,[65] organic thermoelectrics (OTEs),[66] OFETs.[67] Its incor-
poration in an OECT for complimentary circuit application was
ﬁrst reported in 2018 by Fabiano et al.[13a] in which the material
showed very high volumetric capacitance (930 F cm3), with
modest electron mobility (7.0  104 cm2V1s1). Later, in
2021, Inal et al.[68] reported that BBL can maintain its backbone
rigidity while undergoing signiﬁcant swelling in aqueous media.
Its ladder-type rigid backbone, and a lack of solubilizing side-
chains have also triggered scientists to develop new materials
of similar traits.
In 2022, Fabiano et al. investigated the effect of increasing
molecular weight of BBL on the electrochemical properties of
the polymers and the subsequent OECT device performance.[69]
By subjecting 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride
(NDA)
and
1,2,4,5-tetraaminobenzene
tetrahydrochloride
(TABH) to polycondensation reaction in the presence of poly
(phosphoric acid) (PPA), and varying reaction time, four BBL pol-
ymers, BBL15, BBL60, BBL98, BBL152, were obtained after
(Scheme 1a). The subscripts represent the number of repeating
units; for example, 15 means there are 15 BBL monomer repeat-
ing units along the polymer chain.
Increasing molecular weight increases effective conjugation
length and depresses LUMO levels. A low-lying LUMO facilitates
electron injection. Vth decreases with molecular weight (Table 5).
Furthermore, increasing molecular weight results in stronger
interchain electronic coupling, higher crystallinity, and smoother
thin ﬁlms; all of which are favorable for electronic charge
transport.
The OECT devices based on the polymers exhibit n-type accu-
mulation mode of operation, with maximum transconductance
increases with molecular weight. The C*s do not alter signiﬁ-
cantly within the series, with average values in between 500
and 590 F cm3. Therefore, the improvement in performance
is largely attributed to increases in electron mobility, which

BBL-based OECTs exhibited exceptional stability in air, with cur-
rent retentions >95% being observed for 1000 ON-OFF switch-
ing cycles in a 6 h continuous operation.
In this work, the ﬁnding that OECT electron mobility
increases
with
molecular
weight
coincides
with
previous
OFETs’ study.[70] From BBL15 to BBL98, the volumetric capaci-
tance decreases with electron mobility. Whereas BBL152 has
seen an increase in both parameters from BBL98. We postulate
that the general trade-off between the electron mobility and
volumetric capacitance is true until certain molecular weight
threshold is reached, after which enhancement in both param-
eters can be realized. This may also be applicable to other
polymers with solubilizing sidechains. However, general study
of the effect of polymer molecular weight on OECT performance
is scarce.
Benzodifurandione-Based Polymers: Probably inspired by BBL,
in 2022, Huang et al. reported poly(benzodifurandione), poly
(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO), a rigid, ladder-type polymer that
bears no solubilizing sidechains (Scheme 1b).[12] Through exten-
sive investigation of mechanism and structures, the formation of
PBFDO was believed to undergo oxidative polymerization via a
radical pathway and in situ reductive n-doping, in the presence of
quinone oxidants. Quinone TMQ acts as both a catalyst and a
dopant; it gets reduced during polymerization and subsequently
oxidized during doping. PBFDO features a negatively charged
backbone with mobile protons counterbalancing the negative
charges. It has high room-temperature conductivity reaching
2000 S cm1 with doping efﬁciency of 0.89 electrons per repeat-
ing unit. Despite lacking solubilizing sidechains, PBFDO is
intrinsically soluble in polar solvents DMF and DMSO; such sol-
ubility is imparted by the hydrogen bonding of the mobile pro-
tons, and the dipolar cross-relaxation interaction between the
negatively charged conjugated skeleton and solvents, with solvent
molecules being pulled very closely to the polymer chains. Owing
to its sidechain free structure and backbone planarity, PBFDO
has high degree of ordering in ﬁlm, which exhibited edge-on ori-
entation with tight lamellar (d-spacing = 11.18 Å) and π–π stack-
ing (d-spacing = 3.30 Å).
For OECT demonstration, the material needs to be stable
under ambient conditions. The onset reduction level and the
Fermi level of PBFDO were found to be 5.18 and 4.67 eV,
respectively; both of which were sufﬁciently deep to endow
the polymer with ambient stability. Furthermore, the unencap-
sulated polymer was able to maintain 95% of its initial
electrical conductivity after 35 days of air exposure. A normalized
transconductance of 1970 S cm1 was achieved in subsequent
preliminary OECT testing, at a gate voltage of 0.1 V, when
operating with a drain-source voltage of 0.6 V in an aqueous
0.1 M NaCl solution in air. This translates to a μC* of
180 F cm1V1 s1, which is the highest value reported to date;
the speciﬁc values of electron mobility and volumetric capaci-
tance were not reported. In terms of operational stability, the
PBFDO-based OECT was able to maintain its drain current with-
out any drop in a ten-minute on-off cycling test.
The authors also did thickness-based tests. Transconductance
decreases with channel thickness after passing 55 nm. According
to Equation (1), transconductance should increase with channel
thickness. Such drop in performance was ascribed to strong
hydrophobicity upon increasing the thickness that inhibits ion
uptake; in other words, the drop in performance when increasing
channel thickness was due to drop in volumetric capacitance.
μC* normally is thought of being independent of device geome-
try,[23] the fact that C* decreases with channel thickness means
that the common belief has been challenged; using μC* to cross-
compare different materials directly needs to be approached with
a pinch of salt.
Ladder-type polymers generally outperform donor-acceptor/
acceptor-acceptor polymers that have solubilizing sidechains in
terms of μC* and stability. Rigid fused backbones of ladder-type
polymers promote close intermolecular contacts, preserving elec-
tronic conduction pathways both intramolecularly and intermo-
lecularly while undergoing swelling in aqueous media. The
exceptional stabilities of ladder-type polymers are probably
the results of combined effects of aromaticity and the absence
of solubilizing sidechains. NDI is a promising aromatic building
block for synthesizing polymers with good stability as evidenced
by
both
p(gNDI-gT2)
and
BBL.
Nevertheless,
ladder-type
polymers require harsh and often tortuous processing, such
as the use of corrosive methanesulfonic acid for BBL, and high
boiling, non-volatile DMSO for PBFDO, with the latter requires
a 2 week long dialysis for removing small molecular weight
fractions.
2.2. Small Molecule and Oligomeric OMIECs
Small molecule n-type organic semiconductors have been dem-
onstrated with great outcome for organic electronic applications
such as ﬁeld-effect transistors and photovoltaics.[71] In theory,
they likewise should also hold great potential for OMIEC-based
applications, such as OECTs. Small molecules have well deﬁned
structures with little to no batch-to-batch variation. Therefore,
reliable and reproducible device performance can be garnered.
Their monodisperse nature endows direct structure-property
relationships, through which molecular design and synthetic
iterations can facilely deduce optimal structural orderings and
effective mixed ionic and electronic charge transports.[72]
The molecular design principles and structure-property rela-
tionships of small molecules for OECTs are fundamentally the
same as that of the polymers. The performances of small mole-
cules are enhanced primarily by making them bigger with
extended conjugation lengths along the backbones. Small mole-
cule OMIECs are scarcer than polymers with about eight articles
in total.

2.2.1. Fullerene-Based Small Molecules
The ﬁrst n-type small molecule OMIEC was reported in
2019 by Ginger et al.[73] which is a fullerene derivative with
hydrophilic OEG sidechains, C60-TEG (Figure 6a), demon-
strating a μC* of 7.0 F cm1 V1s1 (entry 1, Table 6). PCBM
was used as a reference for comparison; owing to its hydropho-
bicity, volumetric charging could not be realized in aqueous
media.
2.2.2. PDI- and NDI-Based Small Molecules
Gupta et al. used gNDI-Br2 (Figure 6b) as a channel material for
OECTs.[74] gNDI-Br2 is the pre-polymerization NDI comonomer
precursor of p(gNDI-gT2), p(C3-gNDI-gT2), and p(C8-T2).
Ironically, the material exhibited a μC* of 0.13 F m1V1 s1
(entry 2, Table 6), which is comparable to that of the p(C3-
gNDI-gT2) and p(C8-T2). In terms of stability, it was able to
maintain 95% of its initial current after a ≈15 min ON-OFF

cycling test, such stability beats most small molecules and is on
par with NDI-based polymers.
Three perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives (4Cl-PDI-4EG, 4Cl-
PDI-3EG, and PDI-3EG) were reported in 2022 (Figure 6b) for
demonstration as potential channel materials of OECTs by
Yue et al.[75] Introducing electron withdrawing chlorine groups
at bay positions depresses LUMOs with a drop in hydrophilicity.
The steric clash of chlorine groups also introduced atropisomer-
ism with core twisting, which has direct effect on molecular
ordering and thin ﬁlm morphology. Of the three polymers,
4Cl-PDI-3EG has the highest μC* (0.17 F cm1 V1 s1, entry
4, Table 6) on account of the highest mobility, which is due
to its ability to maintain signiﬁcant proportion of crystallinity
during electrochemical doping; 4Cl-PDI-4EG has the lowest
Vth of 0.05 V with the best operational stability. Therefore, it
was subsequently incorporated in an OECT for H2O2 sensing
demonstrations, which showed a detection limit of 0.75 μM with
decent selectivity.
Later
the
group
introduced
t-gdiPDI
and
d-gdiPDI
(Figure 6b),[76] which are dimer equivalents of 4Cl-PDI-3EG
fused at different bay positions; t and d mean triple and double
connectivity, respectively. d-gdiPDI features a more twisted
cruciform-like conformation, which in turn hinders close π-π
stacking and is detrimental for charge transport. In contrast,
such conformation facilitates hydrated ion uptake, allowing them
to penetrate into the bulk of the material. Therefore, d-gdiPDI
has higher volumetric capacitance and lower electron mobility
than that of t-gdiPDI (entry 6 and 7, Table 6). It is interesting
to note that t-gdiPDI has comparable electron mobility and volu-
metric capacitance as that of the 4Cl-PDI-3EG. The improvement
in performance upon dimerization as seen for d-gdiPDI is
mainly a consequence of enhanced volumetric capacitance,
which is the highest among the current library of small molecule
OMIECs.
2.2.3. Isatin-Based Small Molecules and Oligomers
In 2022, Yue et al. introduced gNR and hgNR (Figure 7), which
displayed μC*s of 2.5 F cm1 V1 s1 and 1.2 F cm1 V1 s1,
respectively, when processed with chloroform.[77] When gNR
was processed with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaﬂuoroiso-propanol (HFIP)
instead,
the
performance
was
doubled
with
a
μC*
of
5.12 F cm1 V1 s1.[78] The improvement was due to favorable
solid state aggregation (beneﬁcial for charge transport) induced
by HFIP with more facile/efﬁcient ion insertion. Following that,
the group then introduced 3gDNR and 4gDNR,[79] and bgTNR
and lgTNR.[80] The DNR and TNR series can be roughly regarded
as the dimer and trimer equivalents of the NR series. The build-
ing blocks of these compounds, featuring isatin and rhodanine
derivatives, were fused together via C═C by condensation, thus
rendering the ﬁnal compounds planar with rigid backbones.
Within each pair, the cores are identical but with different side-
chains. The DNR and TNR series were all processed with HFIP,
and the compound with higher μC* from each pair is selected for
illustration in the following, i.e., gNR, 3gDNR and bgTNR. From
gNR through 3gDNR to bgTNR, the molecules are essentially
made bigger entering into oligomeric domain, with increase
in the effective conjugation length, which is beneﬁcial for
charge transport. This is reﬂected in electron mobilities,
0.018 cm2 V1 s1 for gNR, 0.043 cm2 V1 s1 for 3gDNR, and
0.29 cm2 V1 s1 for bgTNR (entry 10, 11, and 14, Table 6).
The high mobility of bgTNR is primarily ascribed to its close
π–π stacking with oblique ordering in the solid state that is favor-
able for 3D charge transport. It is also worth mentioning that
these isatin-based small molecules and oligomers have the same
isatin core as that of the PgNaN. However, their performance in
terms of μC* are signiﬁcantly higher than that of the PgNaN
(processed with chloroform), owing to signiﬁcantly higher elec-
tron mobility, probably because small molecules and oligomers

than polymers.
2.2.4. DPP-Based Small Molecules
Lei et al.[81] reported TDPP-CN-G7 and TDPP-RD-G7 (Figure 7),
which are thiophene-ﬂanked DPPs end-capped with malononi-
trile and 3-ethylrhodanine, respectively. TDPP-CN-G7 has a
μC* of 0.80 F cm1 V1 s1, with an electron mobility of
0.005 cm2 V1 s1 (entry 15, Table 6). TDPP-RD-G7, in contrast,
has a much higher μC* of 5.88 F cm1 V1 s1 (entry 16,
Table 6), due to its signiﬁcantly higher electron mobility
(0.075 cm2 V1 s1). The superior performance of TDPP-RD-
G7 results from its J-type aggregation behaviour in both solution
and thin ﬁlm, promoting close π–π stacking for efﬁcient
intermolecular charge transport. Furthermore, the J-type aggre-
gation in the solid state forms a domain that mimics polymer
network, allowing facile ion doping/de-doping. As a result,
the molecule has fast transient response time with τON/
τOFF = 10.5 ms/0.32 ms, which are the fastest among the current
library of small molecule OECT channel materials.
3. Stability
Excellent operational stability and shelf-life are essential for the
commercialization of OECTs; operational stability furnishes
stable signal output with reliable and reproducible measure-
ments, and long shelf-life would ensure the device performance
are retained from production to use. Detailed device stability

study of n-type OECTs is blank, as it is a complicated matter,
encompassing many different perspectives. The choices of chan-
nel materials, electrodes, electrolytes, processing conditions, and
device architectures, etc., all of which can greatly inﬂuence the
devices’ operational stability and shelf-life.
The following results of stability studies extracted from rele-
vant original articles are preliminary, they focus primarily on the
channel material perspective and are only right within their own
frames. Nevertheless, the results shall give readers generic ideas
of how each class of material performs.
Operational stability is the major concern of channel materi-
als, which is often correlated to the chemical structures, energet-
ics, morphological changes during electrochemical doping/
dedoping processes in aqueous electrolytes. Water and oxygen
can act as electron traps by reacting with the radical anions
(polaron or bipolaron) of OMIECs. Such issue is often mitigated
by designing materials with sufﬁciently depressed LUMOs (see
Section 1.2).
Despite most NDI-based D-A polymers have relatively low
μC*s, their OECTs typically exhibit good operational stability,
with p(gNDI-gT2)-based OECT being the ﬁrst example display-
ing stable operation over 2 h.[29a] P-90-based OECT could be
stored up to 132 days in PBS, when doped with tetra-n-butylam-
monium ﬂuoride.[82] The OECT incorporating P4gNDTI exhib-
ited a negligible decrease in its performance when being stored
in ambient air and tested weekly for 4 weeks; this exceptional sta-
bility can be attributed to its low-lying LUMO (4.17 eV) with
0.2 V threshold voltage, inhibiting parasitic reactions with oxy-
gen.[30a] The P(gTDPP2FT)-based OECT had ≈50% current
retention after
3500 s cycling test and 30 day
storage.[52]
Among D-A type polymers featuring BTI derivatives, f-BTI2G-
TVTCN demonstrated the highest μC* (41.3 F cm1 V1 s1),
but its device was only able to retain 75% of its initial drain cur-
rent after 40 min of gate voltage pulsing.[57] p(C2F-V) showed a
current retention of 77.2% in air over 1 h intermittent switching,
and a much higher current retention of 99.4% under oxygen-free
environment, demonstrating that oxygen is the origin of perfor-
mance degradation.[30b] gAIID-2FT exhibited exceptional opera-
tional stability and long shelf-life in ambient enclosures,
maintained 100% of the initial drain current after 3 h of contin-
uous ON-OFF switching and 28 days of storage in ambient air.[64]
PgNaN retained 75% of the initial current after 2000 s continu-
ous ON-OFF cycles via repeated gate pulsing.[59] Ladder-type BBL
exhibited excellent operational stability with 95% current reten-
tion after 6 h of switching cycles.[69]
The stability of OECTs incorporating small molecules remains
challenging, with overall much poorer stability than polymer-
based OECTs, because small molecules typically undergo signif-
icantly irreversible morphological changes upon electrochemical
doping. C60-TEG was able to maintain 85% of its initial current
after 5 min of repeated cycling.[73] Like their NDI-based polymer
counterparts, PDI-based small molecules exhibited good opera-
tional stability, with 4Cl-PDI-4EG, t-gdiPDI, and d-gdiPDI show-
ing no sign of degradation in the ON current over the course of
test.[75,76] For the isatin-based NR series small molecules, the
operational stability decreases with effective conjugation length,
with bgTNR despite having the highest μC* among small
molecules retaining 37% of its initial drain current only after
30 min of ON-OFF switching, with pronounced morphological
changes.[77,79,80] Upon replacing chloroform with ﬂuorinated
alcohols, signiﬁcant improvement in operational stability with
up to 4-fold increase in current retention was observed for
gNR, suggesting the importance of solvent choice for optimal
device performance.[78] The origin of such improvement still
requires further investigation. For DPP-based small molecule
OMIECs, TDPP-RD-G7 was able to retain ≈70% of initial current
after 100 cycles in air, signiﬁcantly better than that of TDPP-CN-
G7 (≈20% after 40 cycles).[81] Overall, small molecule OMIECs
are promising alternatives to their polymer counterparts only if
their stabilities can be dramatically improved to be on par with
that of polymers.
4. Applications
OECTs can transduce ionic signals to electronic ones, and they
typically operate at sub-1 V with high transconductance.[2]
Therefore, they are of interest for certain applications of
integrated
circuits,[13a,83]
biosensors,[15,84]
neuromorphic
devices,[30b,44] etc. In this section, the applications of n-type
OECTs will be discussed in passing. It is noteworthy that major-
ity of the works discussed below are proof-of-concepts. Taking
P-90 OECT glucose biosensors for example,[15,85] the measure-
ments were conducted on analytes of known concentrations.
Whereas in reality, being able to quantitatively deduce glucose
samples of unknown concentrations is preferred.
4.1. Complementary Circuits
Fabiano et al. constructed the ﬁrst OECT-based complementary
inverter from p-type P3CPT and n-type BBL.[13a] The device
exhibited high gain, >11, at supply voltage (VDD) of 0.6 V with
input voltage swept from 0 to 0.6 V. Furthermore, owing to bal-
anced ambipolar charge transports between the two materials, a
large worst-case margin of 0.2 V at VDD of 0.6 V was obtained,
which is 67% of the maximum theoretical value, signiﬁcantly
larger than those of p-MOS inverters used in complex cir-
cuitry.[86] The circuit has the potential to be utilized as a biological
signal transducer. Torricelli et al. further expanded the results by
replacing the P3CPT with PEDOT:PSS.[83] The resultant circuit
was used for ion sensing demonstration, in which changes in the
concentration of the electrolyte shift the switching threshold of
the inverter with a sensitivity of 2300 mV V1 dec1. The clinical
relevance of the complementary inverter was also successfully
demonstrated by incorporating an ion-sensitive membrane
(ISM) for the detection of potassium in human serum. Later,
in 2022, Fabiano et al. replaced the P3CPT with P(g42T-T),
and introduced polycationic PQ-10 and polyanionic PSSNa
hydrogels as the electrolytes, which allow the development of
screen-printed solid-state OECTs and complementary circuits
(Figure 8).[6a] A single-stage ampliﬁer was subsequently fabri-
cated, which operated at a low voltage with a power-normalized
gain of up to 169 dB μ W1; the ampliﬁer was able to sense low
amplitude signals, as low as 100 μV, with a maximum gain of
30.4 dB. In addition, a two-stage ampliﬁer was assembled mono-
lithically with a DC gain of 193 V/V. van de Burgt et al. assembled
a complementary inverter with p-type Pg2T-TT and n-type

PNDI2TEG-2Tz; the device showed a maximum gain of 23.4 at
VDD = 0.6 V, with small hysteresis.[44]
4.2. Biosensors
Inal et al. incorporated P-90 in a micrometre-scale OECT for lac-
tate detection.[84] P-90 was used both as the gate electrode and as
the channel material, onto which lactate oxidase was adsorbed.
The hydrophilic sidechain of P-90 facilitates conjugation with the
lactate oxidase, and the NDI-T2 core is capable of accepting
electrons from the enzymatic redox reaction of lactate and the
lactate oxidase. Under a given gate voltage, by varying the con-
centration of lactate, the drain currents could be modulated.
By varying biasing conditions, a wide dynamic range of detection
was achieved. The device was selective, sensitive, and fast, and
did not require any electron mediator or a reference electrode,
which are typically required in an amperometric enzyme
electrode. The work provides a means for the development of
enzyme-based electrocatalytic energy storage/generation devices
in addition to biosensors.
By replacing the analyte and enzyme couple (i.e., lactate and
lactate oxidase) with glucose and glucose oxidase (GOx), a glu-
cose biosensor was emerged.[15] Like that of the lactate sensor,
the sensitivity could be tuned by varying the biasing conditions,
with a dynamic range from 10 nM to 20 mM. Furthermore, by
employing the GOx adsorbed P90 as an anode along with a p-type
polymer cathode, an enzymatic fuel cell (EFC) was assembled.
The fuel cell consumes glucose to provide energy. Under correct
setup the EFC could drive certain circuit elements such as
OECTs and light emitting diodes.
The n-type P-90-based OECT biosensor was later integrated
with
microﬂuidics
for
real-time
monitoring
of
glucose
(Figure 9).[85] The integration of microﬂuidics enhanced the
steady-state performance of the OECT. Therefore, during
glucose sensing demonstration, the device exhibited higher
signal to noise ratio (SNR) on the detection site and higher
sensitivity to low glucose concentrations when compared with
its
microﬂuidic-free
counterpart.
Such
work
offered
new
insight into the design of micro total analysis systems. Very
recently, Inal et al. constructed a complementary ampliﬁer

sensor from p(C2F-V)-based OECT for detecting the α-synuclein
of Parkinson’s disease.[30b] The work proved the concept that
complementary ampliﬁer is more sensitive than the OECT
sensor on its own.
4.3. Neuromorphic Computing
van de Burgt et al. did some preliminary studies on organic elec-
trochemical resistive random-access memory devices (EC-RAM)

constructed from ion-gel gated electrochemical transistors of
PNDI2TEG-2Tz, PNDIODTEG-2Tz and PNDI2OD-2Tz.[44] The
ion-gel solid electrolyte is a blend of an ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-
methyl-imidazolium bis(triﬂuorosulfonyl)imide (EMIM:TFSI)
and poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride-co-hexaﬂuoropropylene) (PVDF-
HFP) (Figure 10a). EC-RAM state retention increases with
OEG ratio, as OEGs chelate cations better than alkyl groups, with
PNDI2TEG-2Tz being the best potential candidate. Inal et al.
demonstrated an artiﬁcial synapse with volatile and non-volatile
features using a p(C2F-V)-based OECT, which featured a vertical
architecture with EMIM:TFSI as the electrolyte.[30b] Fabiano et al.
demonstrated leaky integrate-and-ﬁre type organic electrochemi-
cal neurons using p-type PBBT-Me- and n-type BBL-based
OECTs (Figure 10b). The electrochemical neurons exhibited
biologically relevant ﬁring frequencies of about 2 Hz, and were
able to operate continuously for up to 6.5 h.[87] BBL can
exhibit a reduction in the electrical conductivity on high electro-
chemical doping as a result of the formation of multiple charged
species with reduced mobility.[88] Recently, Fabiano et al. utilized
this ion-tunable, stable, and reversible antiambipolarity of BBL
to fabricate a bio-realistic organic electrochemical neuron
(OECN).[89] The voltage-gated ion channels in biological neurons
were successfully emulated by the OECTs modulated by Naþ
and Kþ, showing various neural features and facial sensing,
and allowing integration with the vagus nerve of a mouse
(Figure 11). In addition, using single-polymer material to achieve
antiambipolar behavior facilitates simple fabrication approaches

5. Summary and Outlook
The OECT is a potential leading device technology in the pioneer-
ing era of bioelectronics. The channel materials, being the key
component of OECTs, have undergone phenomenal develop-
ment due to rapid growth of global interest. Such progress is
underpinned by improved understanding in molecular design
strategies and structure-property relationships. The introduction
of polar OEG sidechains along with highly electron-deﬁcient (het-
ero)arenes (with the exception of sidechain free ladder-type mate-
rials) is a promising generic strategy for synthesizing n-type
OMIECs. The OEG sidechains impart solubility and facilitate
ion uptake; the electron deﬁcient (hetero)arenes with sufﬁciently
depressed LUMOs allow electron transport with ambient stabil-
ity. Much of the recent research has been primarily focusing on
improving electron mobility by enhancing backbone coplanarity
via ﬂuorination (as seen for P(gTDPP2FT)), cyanation (as seen
for f-BTI2G-TVTCN), H-bonding (as seen for gNDI-V), and
the incorporation of fused arenes (as seen for bgTNR), etc.
Fluorination in particular facilitates ion uptake without detri-
mental swellings, thus preserving backbone planarity for effec-
tive electronic conduction pathways.
Of all the n-type OMIECs discussed, few of them exhibited
μC* higher than 100 F cm1 V1 s1. The overall development
of n-type OMIECs still lags behind their p-type counterparts with
the current library of n-type OMIECs for OECTs still being rather
limited. Therefore, the current primary goal is still diversifying
the library by introducing new building blocks with the powerful
toolbox of synthesis. Furthermore, as OECT performance is a col-
lective feature that is dependent on factors other than just chan-
nel material, e.g., the choices of electrodes, device conﬁguration,
electrolytes, and processing technology, etc., directly comparing
the benchmarking ﬁgure of merit μC* of different OMIECs
needs to be approached with a pinch of salt.
As OECTs are mainly for biologically related applications,
developing n-type OMIECs that are biocompatible and can
directly interface with biological organisms, such as tissues
and cell membranes, are of particular interest, simplifying the
overall device architectures with the elimination of mediators.
Furthermore, endowing these n-type materials with more func-
tionalities, such as stretchability and self-healing, along with the
incorporation of p-type materials of comparable performance
would facilitate the development of implantable/wearable bio-
medical devices of low static power consumption. These features
require deeper understanding of OECT operating mechanisms,
which may be assisted with more advanced in situ operando
characterization techniques.
Overall, the better molecular designs and developing list of
applications have narrowed the gap between n-type OECTs
and their p-type counterparts. The structure-property relation-
ships outlined throughout this review will further the progress
at an accelerated rate.
