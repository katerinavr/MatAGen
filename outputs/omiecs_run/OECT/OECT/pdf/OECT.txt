The invention of the transistor in 1947 heralded the era 
of microelectronics. Made of semiconductors, dielectrics 
and metals, the transistor enabled control of the flow 
of electrons in a solid-state device, thereby providing a 
robust alternative to vacuum tubes. Its miniaturization 
led to the development of the integrated circuit, which is 
at the heart of every modern electronic device. Modern 
transistors rely on field-effect doping; the number of 
mobile electrons (n‑type) or holes (p‑type) inside a semi­
conductor is modulated by a voltage applied to a metallic 
electrode, which is separated from the semiconductor by a 
thin insulating layer (the gate dielectric)1. Such devices are 
referred to as MOSFETs, which is short for metal-oxide-­
semiconductor field-effect transistors. Interest in organic 
electronic materials, and in particular their potential for 
low-cost fabrication over large areas, led to the develop­
ment of organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)2. These 
devices use conjugated, semiconducting small molecules 
and polymers and offer an alternative to inorganic devices 
for applications in which facile processing on different 
substrates and tunable electronic properties are required. 
Steady progress over the past three decades has led to 
the systematic development of materials with mobilities 
well above those of amorphous silicon, combined with 
impressive stability3,4. The potential of OFETs has been 
demonstrated in a variety of applications, including pixel 
drivers for displays5, bionic skin6, stretchable transistors7 
and extremely sensitive chemical sensors8 that are even 
able to withstand operation in saltwater9.
The organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) 
was developed by Wrighton and colleagues10 in the 
mid‑1980s. An OECT consists of an organic semi­
conductor film that is in contact with an electrolyte, 
in which an electrode (the gate) is immersed (FIG. 1a). 
Metal electrodes, called the source and drain, establish 
contact with the organic semiconductor film and define 
the channel through which holes or electrons flow from 
the source to the drain. An OECT relies on ions that 
are injected from the electrolyte into the organic film, 
thereby changing its doping state and hence its con­
ductivity11. The operation, which is described using the 
terminology of both electrochemistry and solid-state 
physics, is controlled by voltages applied to the gate (gate 
voltage, VG) and to the drain (drain voltage, VD), which 
are referenced with respect to the source electrode. 
The gate voltage controls the injection of ions into the 
channel and therefore the doping state (redox state in 
the language of electrochemistry) of the organic film. 
The drain voltage induces a current (drain current, ID), 
which is proportional to the quantity of mobile holes or 
electrons in the channel, and therefore probes the dop­
ing state of the organic film. Like MOSFETs and OFETs, 
OECTs operate like a switch, in which the gate voltage 
(input) controls the drain current (output). They can 
also be viewed as an amplifier, in which the power of 
an input signal is amplified on the way to the output12.
A typical material for OECTs is the conducting 
poly­mer poly(3,4‑ethylenedioxythiophene) doped 
with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The semi­
conducting PEDOT is p‑type doped (oxidized in the 
language of electrochemistry), which leads to mobile 
holes that can hop from one chain to another, resulting

Abstract | Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) make effective use of ion injection from 
an electrolyte to modulate the bulk conductivity of an organic semiconductor channel. 
The coupling between ionic and electronic charges within the entire volume of the channel 
endows OECTs with high transconductance compared with that of field-effect transistors, 
but also limits their response time. The synthetic tunability, facile deposition and 
biocompatibility of organic materials make OECTs particularly suitable for applications in 
biological interfacing, printed logic circuitry and neuromorphic devices. In this Review, we 
discuss the physics and the mechanism of operation of OECTs, focusing on their identifying 
characteristics. We highlight organic materials that are currently being used in OECTs and 
survey the history of OECT technology. In addition, form factors, fabrication technologies and 
applications such as bioelectronics, circuits and memory devices are examined. Finally, we take 
a critical look at the future of OECT research and development.

in a hole current once a drain voltage is applied. These 
holes are compensated by the sulfonate anions of PSS, 
which in terms of solid-state physics can be considered 
as ionized acceptors13. OECTs based on conducting poly­
mers, such as PEDOT:PSS, work in depletion mode. In 
the absence of a gate voltage, a hole current flows in the 
channel (that is, the ON state). Once a positive gate bias 
is applied, cations from the electrolyte are injected into 
the channel and the anions are compensated (FIG. 1b). 
This is equivalent to compensation doping, that is, 
implanting donors in p‑type silicon. As a result, the 
number of holes in the channel decreases and the film is 
dedoped as the holes that are extracted at the drain are 
not replenished at the source. This leads to a drop in the 
drain current, and the device reaches the OFF state11. 
By contrast, accumulation-mode OECTs made of semi­
conducting polymers are normally in the OFF state 
owing to the small number of mobile holes in the chan­
nel (FIG. 1c). Application of a negative gate voltage causes 
injection of anions into the channel and a corresponding 
accumulation of holes (electrochemical doping in the 
language of electrochemistry), leading to the ON state14.
The identifying characteristic of OECTs is that 
doping changes occur over the entire volume of the 
channel, as opposed to a thin interfacial region like in 
field-effect transistors (FETs) (BOX 1). Therefore, large 
modulations in the drain current can be achieved 
for low-gate voltages, which makes OECTs efficient 
switches and powerful amplifiers12,15. The use of elec­
trolytes instead of MOS capacitors also allows for large 
flexibility in device architecture and integration with a 
variety of substrates, employing a variety of form fac­
tors and a broad range of fabrication processes. The 
inherent tunability of organic molecules further ena­
bles the optimization of ion and electron transport and 
facile biofunctionalization. Because of these features, 
OECTs are being explored for a wealth of applications, 
including neural interfaces16,17, chemical and biologi­
cal sensors18,19, printed circuits20,21 and neuro­morphic 
devices22,23. In this Review, we discuss the physics of 
OECTs and the different organic materials used to make 
the devices, as well as outline the evolution of their tech­
nology, highlight various applications and take a critical 
look at the future of OECT research and development.
The device physics of OECTs
OECTs transduce small voltage signals applied to the 
gate into large changes in the drain current. This trans­
duction process is described by a transfer curve, which 
shows the dependence of the drain current on the gate 
voltage (FIG. 1b,c). The steeper the transfer curve, the 
larger the change in drain current for a given gate volt­
age signal. The efficiency of transduction is calculated 
by the first derivative of the transfer curve, namely, 
transconductance gm = ∂ID/∂VG, which is an important 
figure of merit for transistors. OECTs possess very high 
transconductance values, on the order of millisiemens 
for micrometre-scale devices12, which is attributed to the 
volumetric nature of their response.
An essential consideration in OECT physics is 
described by the Bernards model11. This model assumes

that ions from the electrolyte enter the channel and 
change the electronic conductivity throughout its vol­
ume, capturing the steady-state and transient response11. 
According to this model, the device is divided into two 
circuits: an ionic circuit, which describes the flow of 
ions in the gate–electrolyte–channel structure, and an 
electronic circuit, which describes the flow of electronic 
charge in the source–channel–drain structure according 
to Ohm’s law (FIG. 1d). Therefore, the electronic circuit 
is treated as a resistor, in which electronic charge drifts 
under the influence of the local potential in a fashion 
identical to that of MOSFETs. The ionic circuit consists 
of a resistor, describing the flow of ions in the electrolyte, 
in series with a capacitor, describing the storage of ions 
in the channel. This model implies a purely capacitive 
process, according to which ions injected in the channel 
do not exchange charge with the organic film but rather 
electrostatically compensate the presence of opposite 
charges24. In this model, therefore, there are no electro­
chemical reactions between the electrolyte and the chan­
nel. At steady state, the capacitor is charged and the gate 
current goes to zero.
The Bernards model provides a good fit for the out­
put characteristics of OECTs and allows quantitative 
predictions of the transconductance, gm. At saturation 
and for depletion-mode devices, it gives17:
gm = (W/L)∙d∙μ∙C*∙(VTh – VG),	
(1)
where W, L and d are the channel width, length and 
thickness, respectively; μ is the charge-carrier mobility; 
C* is the capacitance per unit volume of the channel; 
and VTh is the threshold voltage. The voltage terms are 
reversed for accumulation-mode devices. This equation 
is similar to the one for FETs, with the difference that the 
product d∙C* replaces the capacitance per unit area of the 
MOS capacitor, C’. This variation defines the difference 
between the two devices. In a FET, the physical thickness 
of the channel does not enter the equation, whereas in 
an OECT, the channel thickness is a para­meter that can 
tune the performance. For example, in a typical OFET 
with a 100 nm-thick SiO2 layer, Cʹ is in the tens of nF cm−2 
(REF. 25). In OFETs gated with an electrolyte, the Cʹ of 
the electrical double layer is of the order of 1–10 μF cm−2 
(REFS 26,27). In an OECT with a 130 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS 
channel, the product of d∙C*, which is the equivalent 
capacitance per unit area, is 500 μF cm−2 (REF. 17) (BOX 1). 
Therefore, volumetric gating gives OECTs a better per­
formance in terms of amplification compared with other 
transistor technologies12.
The high transconductance of OECTs comes at the 
cost of rather slow operation. The Bernards model pre­
dicts that the response time is limited by either the ionic or 
the electronic circuit11. In most devices, the ionic circuit 
dominates the response time, dictated by the product of 
the resistance of the electrolyte and the capacitance of the 
channel. The latter is proportional to the thickness of 
the channel; therefore, OECTs are slower as d increases. 
As a result, channel thickness can be used as a para­meter 
to adjust the trade off between gain and bandwidth17. 
In practice, microfabricated OECTs with liquid electro­
lytes can achieve response times of a few tens of micro­
seconds12, limiting the scope to applications that require 
maximum frequencies in the range of tens of kilohertz. 
This is adequate for most biosensor applications, which 
are quasi-static, and for recording electrophysiological 
signals28. The use of gel or solid electrolytes leads to even 
slower response times, yet there are possibilities for appli­
cation in areas such as printed electronics that do not 
require fast transistors29.
The Bernards model offers a good starting point for 
understanding the basic physics of OECTs, but there 
are other considerations that have been or still need to 
be taken into account. For example, spatially resolved 
voltage measurements along the OECT channel imply 
that the conductivity along the channel varies with 
charge density in a nonlinear fashion30. Introducing a 
charge density-dependent conductivity in the Bernards 
model improves the quality of the output curve fitting 
of PEDOT:PSS OECTs31. Nonideal contacts in OECTS 
introduce additional complications32. A more accurate 
description of the transfer curve is achieved by consid­
ering the influence of disorder on hole transport in the 
channel33. Finally, OECTs represent the limit at which ions 
freely penetrate the volume of the channel. This has been 
demonstrated in several materials in which capacitance

Box 1 | Organic-based transistors
Field-effect transistors (FETs)
In a FET, an organic semiconductor film (the channel) is separated from a metal 
electrode (the gate) by a thin insulating layer (the gate dielectric). A voltage applied 
between the gate and the channel leads to field-effect doping of the semiconductor, 
that is, the accumulation of mobile electronic charge near the interface with the 
dielectric (figure, part a). The charge in the channel is compensated for by a sheet of 
charge at the gate electrode. The two sheets of charge form the two plates of a parallel 
plate capacitor. The amount of charge that is induced in the channel can be estimated 
by Q = C·V, where C is the capacitance of the dielectric and V is the gate voltage. The 
capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the two plates. Therefore, 
thin dielectric layers maximize the amount of induced charge and thus the drain current 
of the transistor. In an electrolyte-gated FET, a double-layer capacitor is formed at the 
electrolyte–channel interface (figure, part b). A sheet of ionic charge in the electrolyte 
compensates the induced sheet of electronic charge in the channel. This configuration 
can be considered an extreme case of FET, because the thickness of the dielectric is 
reduced to dimensions on a par with the ionic radius, resulting in high capacitance.
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)
In an accumulation-type OECT, ions penetrate the semiconductor, leading to changes in 
the doping state throughout the channel (figure, part c). This configuration is described 
not by a parallel plate capacitance but by a volumetric capacitance, which can be many 
orders of magnitude larger. Compared with a FET of similar size, the same gate voltage 
induces more electronic charge in the channel and thus a larger drain current in an 
OECT. Similary, high drain current can be achieved with depletion-type devices.

is found to be proportional to film thickness14,17,34. 
Electrolyte-gated FETs represent the other limit at which 
ions accumulate at the surface of the channel. Some 
materials show behaviour between the two limits35,36, 
suggesting the presence of a barrier for ion injection. 
These observations point to an important fundamen­
tal issue. The physics of hole and electron injection and 
transport in organic semiconductors has been exten­
sively studied over the past few decades, whereas lit­
tle is known about the processes of ion injection and 
transport in organic semiconductors.
As a consequence of the gating through an electrolyte, 
OECTs have some specific characteristics. For example, 
the fraction of the applied gate voltage that drops across 
the channel is controlled by the nature and geometry of 
the gate electrode37,38. If a polarizable electrode, such as 
Pt or Au, is used as the gate, two capacitors are formed 
in the ionic circuit; one capacitor corresponds to the 
electrical double layer formed at the gate–electrolyte 
interface and the other corresponds to the volumetric 
capacitance of the channel. Because the capacitors are in 
series, the applied gate voltage drops across the smaller 
capacitor (FIG. 1d). For efficient gating, the capacitance 
of the gate electrode must be more than ten times larger 
than the capacitance of the channel, otherwise a large 
fraction of the applied gate voltage will drop at the gate–
electrolyte interface (FIG. 1d). Such large gates can be 
technically difficult to implement for some applications; 
however, using a thick PEDOT:PSS electrode as the gate 
can help achieve a large gate capacitance. Alternatively, 
a nonpolarizable gate electrode, such as Ag/AgCl, can be 
used. In this case, the voltage drop at the gate–electrolyte 
interface is negligible39, and effective gating is achieved. 
However, it should be noted that in some sensing appli­
cations, a small gate electrode is preferable, for example, 
when a sensing reaction is meant to occur at the gate and 
the channel merely acts as the transducer40. Finally, the 
nature of the electrolyte, liquid, gel or solid and the ion 
concentration influence the response time of the transis­
tor because the electrolyte conductivity determines the 
resistor of the ionic circuit41.
Materials for OECTs
The channel of OECTs is typically made of a conduct­
ing polymer, most commonly PEDOT or polypyrrole 
(PPy), doped with p‑type dopants such as small anions 
or poly­anions (FIG. 2a,b). These materials are synthesized 
by solution, vapour-phase or electrochemical polymeri­
zation. By far, the most popular material is PEDOT:PSS, 
which has been explored for a great variety of applica­
tions over the past 15 years, owing mainly to its com­
mercial availability in the form of aqueous dispersions, 
which permits the facile deposition of thin films using 
solution-processing techniques13. The dispersions are 
prepared by polymerizing EDOT, the monomer of 
PEDOT, in the presence of PSS. Films of PEDOT:PSS 
cast from these dispersions show high electronic13 
(hole) conductivity and are widely used in electrostatic 
coatings and as anodes for light-emitting diodes and 
solar cells13. As a consequence, the structure and elec­
tronic conductivity of these films have been thoroughly 
investigated42,43. Various co‑solvents, surfactants and 
processing methods have been used to maximize hole 
conductivity, which is currently in excess of 1,000 S cm−1 
(REF. 44). Electrochemical moving-front measurements 
revealed that small ions are injected from an electro­
lyte into PEDOT:PSS films in a barrierless fashion and 
have drift mobilities close to those in bulk water45–47. 
Finally, PEDOT:PSS films show good electrochemical 
stability in aqueous electrolytes48 and can be rendered 
insoluble in water through the addition of crosslinkers 
such as (3‑glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane49,50 and 
divinylsulfone51. Overall, it is technically rather simple 
to make PEDOT:PSS OECTs with a transconductance 
in the range of millisiemens and a response time in the 
range of tens of microseconds12, which makes devices 
based on this conducting polymer suitable for the vast 
majority of the applications pursued for OECTs.
Despite the attractive properties and good per­
formance of PEDOT:PSS in OECTs, these films have 
some limitations. More specifically, the structure of 
PEDOT:PSS is complex, which limits its use as a model 
system for structure–function relationships. Also, in 
terms of electrical properties, the bulky structure of PSS 
affects the volume fraction of PEDOT in the film and 
hence the volumetric capacitance24. For this reason, con­
jugated polymer motifs with higher hole mobility than 
PEDOT, such as ones that rely on fused thiophenes, have 
been developed52. In terms of mechanical properties, 
Young’s modulus of PEDOT:PSS is considerably higher 
than that of most biological tissues49,53, which can be a 
limitation for applications in bioelectronics. Moreover, 
although PEDOT:PSS films are broadly cytocompati­
ble54, polymers or composites allowing more versatile 
biofunctionalization are desirable. Finally, in terms of 
solution processing, the acidity of PSS can cause cor­
rosion of the print heads. These limitations motivate 
researchers to synthesize new materials for OECTs.
Replacing PSS with less acidic polyanions, such as 
polymers containing (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide 
side groups, results in OECTs with a similar perfor­
mance in terms of transconductance and response time 
as PEDOT:PSS-based OECTs55. A different approach 
involves removing PSS and instead attaching ionic 
groups directly on the thiophene backbone through 
side chains. Such conjugated polyelectrolytes are semi­
conducting when the ion is compensated by a counter 
ion (FIG. 2c) or conducting when compensated by an elec­
tronic charge on the conjugated backbone (FIG. 2d). For 
example, accumulation-mode OECTs with a transcon­
ductance of the order of millisiemens have been devel­
oped using a semiconductor based on a polythiophene 
with a sulfonate group attached to the backbone with a 
hexyl chain (PTHS)56 (FIG. 2c). Depletion-mode OECTs 
have been designed using a conductor based on PEDOT 
with a pendant sulfonate group (PEDOT‑S)57 (FIG. 2d). 
Blending a semiconducting and a conducting conjugated 
polyelectrolyte yields OECTs that can be tuned by bal­
ancing the stoichiometry of the channel57. Alternatively, 
conjugated polymers with hydrophilic or ion-transport­
ing side chains can be used as OECT materials. OECTs

PEDOT:PSS with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) provides 
a handle for subsequent silanization, allowing for the 
covalent linkage of biological moieties onto the films 
without any deleterious effects on the electrical prop­
erties58. It has been demonstrated that these films can 
be functionalized with polypeptides and proteins that 
maintain their biological activity.
Electrochemical polymerization is a versatile method 
for incorporating biomolecules in conducting polymers59 
and was used to fabricate the first OECT10. However, the 
method has fallen out of favour because it relies on growth 
from a conducting surface, which is hard to implement 
in OECTs. An alternative method, vapour-phase polym­
erization, can also incorporate different biomolecules in 
the channel of OECTs. In this process, a film cast from 
a precursor solution containing tosylate (TOS, the pen­
dant group of PSS) moieties is exposed to EDOT vapour 
to yield the conducting polymer PEDOT:TOS60 (FIG. 2b). 
The mixing of different polymers in the precursor solu­
tion results in high-quality composites. Indeed, com­
posites of PEDOT:TOS with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
have OECT performance similar to that of pristine 
PEDOT:TOS61. The use of a carboxyl-containing PEG 
demonstrates the potential of vapour-phase polymer­
ization in applications requiring biofunctionalization. 
Furthermore, gelatin, which is the denatured form of the 
extracellular matrix protein collagen, can be incorporated 
into PEDOT:TOS without altering the electrochemical 
properties of the conducting polymer or its performance 
in OECTs62. Such composites were found to support 
bovine brain capillary endothelial cell adhesion and 
growth in vitro, indicating a functional protein. Finally, 
vapour-phase polymerization can be applied to produce 
PEDOT:TOS composites with poly(tetrahydrofuran), 
which show a hysteresis effect in their OECT character­
istics63. The hysteresis is attributed to a conformational 
change in the polymer during redox cycling and was used 
to demonstrate a nonvolatile memory device.
A variety of electrolytes, including gels64 and solids65, 
and the use of different gate electrodes, including tra­
ditional polarizable electrodes (such as Pt)66 and non­
polarizable electrodes (such as Ag/AgCl66) as well as 
non-traditional materials (such as PEDOT:PSS65 and 
various forms of carbon67,68), have been used to fabricate 
OECTs. The choice of material is often dictated by the 
application or limitations imposed by fabrication. To test 
new channel materials, the components commonly used 
are prepatterned Au source and drain electrodes on a 
glass substrate, a Ag/AgCl gate electrode and an aqueous 
solution of NaCl or KCl as the electrolyte.
The history of OECT technology
In 1980, the first indirect measurements of the reversible 
electrochemical switching of electronic conductivity in 
polypyrrole, recorded from films made on Pt electrodes, 
were reported69. A few years later, polypyrrole films 
electro­polymerized onto Au, separated by 1.4 μm gaps 
on SiO2-coated Si wafers, were shown to extend and even 
bridge the gaps between electrodes10. This device had 
the action of an accumulation-mode transistor, which 
was recorded using a two circuit drain–source and a 
gate–counter–reference electrode probing approach. 
Since then, different probing setups and other poly­
mers, such as polypyrrole, poly(3‑methylthiophene)70 
and polyaniline71, have been applied as the active layer 
in electrochemical transistors for redox sensing and 
chemiresistor applications72. In addition, several OECTs 
based on microfabricated lateral electrodes on rigid sub­
strates have been reported (FIG. 3a). Specifically, advances 
have included the fabrication of sandwich structures73, 
the incorporation of solid electrolytes74,75, the use of 
channels that incorporate diaphorase enzymes76 and 
the demonstration of high performance in aqueous 
and nonaqueous electrolytes77.
The use of electrolytes as gating media allows for 
great flexibility in OECT design in terms of placement of 
the gate electrode with respect to the channel. Moreover, 
‘long-channel’ effects can be addressed. In OFETs, 
charges are transported along the thin sheet of accumu­
lated holes or electrons, residing at the semiconductor–
gate dielectric interface. In a long channel, this typically 
results in very low currents, preventing the use of OFETs 
as drivers for power consuming components. This is par­
ticularly problematic in all-printed systems, where only 
long channels can be manufactured with high yield. By 
contrast, in OECTs, the entire bulk contributes to charge 
transport; thus, higher currents can be supplied for the 
same given channel length. Therefore, different designs 
of OECTs with low operating voltage can be fabricated 
with respect to gate, electrolyte, channel dimensions and 
relative positions. Additionally, different deposition and 
patterning techniques on a variety of substrates, includ­
ing flexible and stretchable substrates, can be applied, 
paving the way for drastically new device architectures 
and form factors (FIG. 3b).
The first electrochemical transistor that was, in part, 
manufactured using printing techniques was reported in 
1994 (REF. 78). Carbon-based source and drain electrodes 
and dielectrics were screen-printed on a poly­vinyl chlo­
ride base, and the assembled structure was then cracked 
in liquid nitrogen. Polyaniline was anodically grown 
along the fractured edge and coated with glucose oxi­
dase (GOx) immobilized in poly(1,2‑­diaminobenzene). 
The resulting device, with a channel length and width 
of 20 μm and 4.5 mm, respectively, was used as a micro­
electrochemical enzyme transistor for glucose79 and 
peroxide sensing80. An OECT with a channel length of 
0.5 mm gated through a thick filter paper soaked with 
1 M KCl electrolyte was also reported81.
In the early 1990s, PEDOT was explored as an elec­
tronic ink and coating for a wide range of conductive, 
electronic and electrochemical applications82–84. When 
combined with the dopant PSS, PEDOT shows good 
redox stability and high electronic conductivity, and can 
be incorporated into high-performing OECT structures. 
Using printing techniques, devices in which PEDOT:PSS 
serves as both the active channel and the electrode for 
the gate, drain and source are possible. A decade later, 
the in situ redox switching of the electronic conductivity 
in PEDOT was explored using different electrochemical 
setups and device configurations, such as electrochromic 
pixels85,86. In 2002, the first demonstrations of transistors

with PEDOT were reported65,87,88. For example, by deac­
tivating or patterning PEDOT:PSS coatings using screen 
printing, an all-laterally configured gate, drain and 
source OECT with a screen-printed gelled electrolyte 
on top could be realized87. In such lateral OECTs, drain 
current ON/OFF ratios of 105, a transconductance of 
1.2 mS and a maximum frequency operation of 200 Hz 
can be achieved.
Easy manufacturing protocols for high-performing 
and low operating-voltage OECTs sparked the devel­
opment of various OECT structures that are based 
on PEDOT:PSS and other mixed ionic–electronic 
polymer conductors as well as the development of 
related high-volume manufacturing processes. Lateral 
PEDOT:PSS-based OECTs can be combined with ver­
tical electrochromic display cells and manufactured by 
printing techniques on coated paper to form actively 
addressed smart pixels and displays89. Long PEDOT:PSS 
channels enable integration and gating through micro­
fluidic systems made from polydimethylsiloxane 
(PDMS)90 (FIG. 3c), a technology that also facilitates 
OECT gating through a phospholipid membrane91 and 
through cells92. Polyaniline, PPy and PEDOT nanowires 
can be grown between Pt source and drain electrodes 
and remotely gated through an electrolyte93. OECTs were 
also developed using 3D porous sponges of PEDOT:PSS, 
a form factor of interest for tissue culture applications94 
(FIG. 3d).
Paper and plastic foils are among the largest sur­
faces ever manufactured and therefore have attracted 
great attention from the OECT community. Several 
approaches to standard and modified printing tech­
niques have been explored to produce OECT devices 
and circuits along those surfaces, such as screen print­
ing95 and inkjet printing96. All-screen-printed OECT 
logic circuits, such as flip flops and shift registers oper­
ating at 1.5 V, have been achieved on poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) (PET) substrates21. An ultrathin carrier, 
made on a 4 μm-thin parylene sheet, for OECTs has been 
explored in bioelectronic applications16. Textiles are also 
an attractive carrier for OECTs, with potential applica­
tions in the field of wearable electronics. For example, 
PEDOT-based transistors have been made on Gore-Tex 
as gas sensors on ‘breathable’ substrates97 and have also 
been screen-printed on common fabrics, such as woven 
cotton and Lycra, to serve as wearable sensors for the 
sensing of external biological fluids, for example, sweat, 
saliva and urine98.
Paper and textiles are made of fibres, and several 
approaches have been explored to build OECTs and 
even complex circuits on individual or combinations 
of fibres99 (FIG. 3e). For example, OECTs based on PPy 
made on a nylon nanofibre can be explored for lead-ion 
detection100, and PEDOT:PSS soaked into natural cotton 
fibres can be used to form an OECT channel for saline 
sensing101. PEDOT:PSS has also been explored in com­
bination with nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) as a clad­
ding layer around the fibres. This combination provides 
a scalable technology for self standing and large-scale 
OECT systems, for instance, a reconfigurable OECT 
sticker platform102. A transconductance beyond 1 S has 
also been demonstrated in PEDOT:PSS–NFC OECTs103. 
Finally, a unique form factor has been achieved by mak­
ing OECTs from PEDOT derivatives that are infused 
into living plants104. Such OECTs are envisioned to 
monitor and control plant development in the future.
Applications of OECTs
Bioelectronics
Organic electronic materials and OECTs have a major 
role in various bioelectronic devices for health care-
related uses and biomedical research54,105,106. In electro­
physiology, OECTs are interfaced with electrically active 
tissues and organs to measure cell activity (FIG. 4a). For 
example, microfabricated PEDOT:PSS OECTs on 
parylene substrates can be placed on the brain of a rat 
to record epileptic seizures. The signal-to‑noise ratio 
of such recordings is over 20 dB higher than that of 
PEDOT:PSS electrodes16, and, owing to local signal 
amplification, activities from deep brain tissue can be 
recorded. As a consequence of the direct and oxide-free 
contact between the conducting channel and cerebro­
spinal fluid, OECTs can also be used to locally inject 
current and stimulate neurons107. OECTs that are inte­
grated with organic thin-film transistors are capable of

recording myograms in transgenic rats with high tem­
poral resolution108. Cutaneous applications are also being 
explored. For example, OECTs can record an electro­
cardiogram when placed on human skin109. OECTs can 
further amplify recordings of electrophysiological signals 
from the human brain, heart and muscle17,110,111. Finally, 
PEDOT:PSS OECTs can be sterilized by autoclaving, 
paving the way for clinical applications112.
OECTs can also be used in conjunction with cell 
cultures for drug screening. For example, OECT arrays 
can record action potentials from cardiomyocytes with 
excellent signal-to‑noise ratio113 and provide a spatial 
map of the electrophysiological activity114. OECTs can 
also be used to monitor cell coverage115, barrier tissue 
formation and cellular health116–120 for nonelectrogenic 
cells, such as epithelial cells (FIG. 4b). Most of these meas­
urements involve the growth of a monolayer of cells 
between the channel and the gate, which introduces a 
barrier for ion motion in the electrolyte and therefore 
alters the characteristics of the OECT121. The same prin­
ciple can be applied to study ion channels in supported 
lipid bilayers assembled on PEDOT:PSS channels122. 
Measurement protocols have been developed, using AC 
modulations123 or white noise124 applied at the gate, in 
which OECTs show superior performance compared 
to impedance sensing using electrodes. Given the opti­
cal transparency of PEDOT:PSS in the visible part of 
the spectrum, a key advantage of OECT devices is the 
possibility of simultaneous optical and electronic read­
outs125. Another advantage is that they work in complex 
environments, such as milk, where they were used for 
the detection of enteric pathogens by measuring tran­
sepithelial ion flow126. OECTs have also been applied 
to 3D cell culture models; for example, OECTs can be 
integrated with cyst-like 3D cultures to monitor their 
integrity and the effect of toxic compounds on the cell 
structure127. Finally, it should be mentioned that the 
arrangement of epithelial cells on an OECT channel can 
be controlled by the applied drain and gate voltage128. 
This offers the opportunity to not only monitor but also 
control cell behaviour. To this end, OECTs fabricated 
using porous sponges of PEDOT:PSS were able to host 
and control 3D cell cultures94.
OECTs can also act as transducers in biosensors 
for the detection of electrolytes and metabolites, such 
as glucose and lactate, which are important for human 
health and performance monitoring (FIG. 4c). A variety 
of approaches have been developed to gain selectivity 
in ion detection129,130. For the detection of metabolites, 
the principle of sensor operation relies on the selec­
tive interaction of a redox enzyme with the metabolite 
and the consequent transfer of an electron to the gate 
of the OECT. The resulting change in the drain cur­
rent depends on the concentration of the metabolite40. 
Initially, the enzyme is entrapped in the channel79 or 
dissolved in the electrolyte131. Immobilization of the 
enzyme on the gate electrode then leads to the develop­
ment of highly selective and sensitive sensors132,133. The 
combination of OECTs with microfluidics paves the way 
for multi-analyte sensor platforms134,135, whereas com­
bination with textiles allows for their use in wearable 
applications, for example, for the detection of analytes 
in sweat98,136.
Although many applications of OECTs have focused 
on analyte detection in saline solutions, examples of 
sensing in breath137, sweat138, saliva139 or cell culture 
media140 have also been demonstrated. These demon­
strations make OECTs clinically relevant, as exem­
plified by the use of OECT lactate sensors to measure

Figure 4 | Applications of organic electrochemical transistors. Organic 
electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are used in electrophysiology to record the electrical 
activity of cells, such as neurons, in the electrolyte between the channel and the gate 
(part a). They are also used as impedance sensors that record changes in ion permeability 
of cell layers placed between the channel and gate (part b) and for the detection of 
analytes (red circles) that interact with receptors placed at the gate or channel (part c). 
In all these cases, the detection of an event is signalled by a change in the drain current, 
ΔId. A variety of circuits, including inverters and Wheatstone bridges (part d), have been 
developed to process an input voltage signal Vin to an output voltage signal Vout. OECTs 
can also be used as devices that mimic features of biological neural networks, such as the 
ability to control an entire network through a global signal (part e). D, drain; G, gate;

the metastatic potential of tumour cells140. Moreover, 
OECTs provide an easy way to amplify fast-scan cyclic 
voltammetry, allowing for simpler instrumentation com­
pared to commercially available tools141. For example, 
OECTs enable the selective detection of dopamine in 
the presence of interfering compounds, with sensitivi­
ties and limits of detection comparable to, or better than, 
those obtained using sophisticated electro­chemistry 
techniques such as differential pulse voltammetry142. 
Similarly, the highly sensitive detection of adrenaline 
with OECTs has been reported143. Finally, in separate 
studies, OECTs have been shown to be suitable for the 
sensing of DNA144 and bacteria145.
Circuits and logic
The high transconductance and ON/OFF ratios along 
with low-voltage operation have encouraged scientists 
to incorporate OECTs in circuits (FIG. 4d). However, the 
relatively low switching speed compared to MOSFET 
technology prevents their application in (digital) signal 
processing and computation. Nevertheless, combining 
OECTs with silicon-based integrated circuits offers 
many promising opportunities, for example, providing 
internet connectivity in electronic label and skin-patch 
applications146. The first step in demonstrating opera­
tional OECT circuits was taken in 2002, when OECTs 
were included as pixel drivers in an active-matrix elec­
trochromic display printed on paper89. PEDOT:PSS 
OECT circuits have also been explored to improve the 
matrix display fill factor147 and to achieve negative-AND 
(NAND) and NOR gates20. Textiles and wire configura­
tions, in addition to paper and plastic foils, represent an 
important large area and flexible platform for OECTs, 
where the fibre grid can potentially serve as a template 
or as an integral part of devices to connect and define 
circuits. Woven OECT logic circuits99, NOR gates and 
inverters, using parallel PEDOT:PSS-based fabric wires 
combined with a polyelectrolyte, have already been 
achieved148. Similar to display pixels, sensor and detector 
devices can be arranged in matrices to enable spatially 
resolved sensing or detection. In such devices, OECTs 
can serve as the addressing switch or line and row driver 
to facilitate the x‑y addressing of individual sensors in 
a crosspoint matrix. In an effort to achieve a touchless 
control interface, OECTs were printed and integrated 
to form addressing columns and readout rows for a 
ferroelectric sensor matrix149.
Analog and logic OECT circuits have been realized 
for a variety of applications using different large-area and 
high-volume manufacturing techniques, such as screen 
printing21,150, lamination147, nanoimprinting151, combined 
inkjet printing and vapour-phase polymerization152. 
A tenfold increase in sensitivity can be achieved using 
a PEDOT:PSS-based signal‑ON sensor circuit, com­
pared with a single OECT sensor153. Such sensor circuits 
can be applied for metabolite detection; for example, a 
Wheatstone bridge consisting of two PEDOT:PSS-based
 OECTs can be used for lactate sensing140. A voltage 
amplifier, combining a high-­transconductance OECT 
with a resistor, enables improved recordings of electro­
cardiographic signals compared with electrodes111. 
Supercapacitor and energy-storage technology con­
stitute other potential areas for the use of electro­
lyte-based devices. In energy-storage modules, several 
capacitors are typically included, with the need for 
high-­transconductance switches to balance charging 
and discharging. An OECT-based differential amplifier 
was manufactured to balance and limit the voltage across 
capacitors to 1 V (REF. 150).
Memory and neuromorphic devices
There is great interest in developing device networks 
involving the co‑location of computation and memory 
because of their efficiency in learning specific tasks, such 
as pattern recognition154–156. These systems are termed 
neuromorphic because they mimic the structure and 
function of the nervous system. Neuromorphic systems 
rely on devices that display temporary or permanent 
changes in electrical properties, thereby simulating 
short-term or long-term memory. Ions in OECTs can 
change the electrical state of the channel; therefore, a 
variety of memory and neuromorphic devices have 
been developed based on OECTs (FIG. 4e). For exam­
ple, in an adaptive device based on a polyaniline chan­
nel and an electrolyte based on LiCl in poly(ethylene 
oxide)157, hysteresis during a voltage sweep gives rise 
to bistable operation, which imparts a dependence 
of the channel resistance on the history of the device. 
Programmed states are stable for timescales of ~1,000 s 
(REF. 158). Follow‑up work explored the integration of 
these devices in neural network architectures159. Devices 
using different electrolytes160 and channel materials161,162 
were evaluated.
In general, an attractive feature of neuromorphic 
devices is their potential for low power consumption 
per switching event. This was demonstrated in devices 
based on polymer nanofibres that exhibit energies as 
low as 1.23 fJ per synaptic spike163. The first neuro­
morphic transistor based on a PEDOT:PSS OECT was 
described in 2015, and neuromorphic functions, such 
as paired-pulse depression, adaptation and dynamic fil­
tering, were demonstrated22. The retention time can be 
further increased from a few seconds to several hours 
by replacing PEDOT:PSS with a modified polymer that 
undergoes a conformational change upon charging164. 
A system using multiple gates to modulate a single 
channel is able to discriminate the orientation of voltage 
patterns imposed on the gate electrode array, emulat­
ing the orientation selectivity of the mammalian visual 
system165. Another system using multiple channels and 
a single gate imitates homeostatic plasticity functions 
of the brain166. A different architecture for an organic 
neuromorphic device combines a battery167,168 and an 
OECT. This design allows the inclusion of over 500 dis­
tinct synaptic states in a narrow (<1 V) voltage range and 
ensures that the programmed states change by less than 
0.1% over tens of hours23. Finally, a ferroelectric polymer 
layer, coated on the gate electrode, can be used to control 
the redox state of a PEDOT:PSS channel169. Polarization 
switching of the ferroelectric polymer, which takes 
place once the coercive field is overcome, introduces a 
bistability that implements memory functionality.

Outlook
OECT research is at the intersection of materials sci­
ence, solid-state physics, electrochemistry and electrical 
engineering. Although the Bernards model describes 
the physics of OECTs, it still needs refinement to better 
understand and optimize device operation. For example, 
the lateral motion of ions inside the channel has to be 
considered, which requires the development of 2D drift 
or diffusion models with appropriate boundary condi­
tions at the electrolyte–channel interface. On a more 
fundamental level, although electronic charge injection 
at metal–organic interfaces has been well studied170,171, 
little is known about ion injection from electrolytes 
into organic semiconductors owing to the difficulty in 
measuring ion injection and transport in the presence 
of electronic charge45. These processes are expected to 
be sensitive to the microstructure of the polymer and 
therefore should be analysed at a microscopic level172. 
Moreover, charge transport in OECT channels is com­
plex173,174 owing to the presence of water, high charge 
densities and dopants. For example, the effect of a large 
amount of water on the density of states of organic semi­
conductors remains elusive. However, computational 
methods that could answer this question are within reach. 
Finally, the development of simulation program with 
integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) models is expected 
to greatly boost the design of OECT-based circuits175,176.
Polymers with better performance than PEDOT:PSS 
are being developed. However, the lack of structure–
function relationships hinders the rational design and 
synthesis of new materials. The development of in situ 
and operando measurements that combine structural, 
spectroscopic and electrical properties is particularly 
important because the film structure changes upon 
immersion and operation in an electrolyte environ­
ment46,47,172. Material properties need to be adapted to 
the purpose, environment and operational lifetime 
of a given device and application. For example, a sta­
bility of several weeks in aqueous electrolyte is a pri­
mary consideration for cell culture-based diagnostics, 
whereas a stability of a few minutes might be adequate 
for disposable sensors. Biocompatibility is crucial for 
implantable devices but not for memory-storage devices. 
Reversibility of the drain current through repeated gate 
pulses is highly desirable for most circuit and sensing 
applications, whereas hysteretic behaviour through trap­
ping and retention of ions, and morphology changes 
in the channel allows for applications in memory and 
neuro­morphic devices. Finally, the possibility to tailor 
ion selectivity paves the way for the development of 
different biosensors.
A consideration for materials design that is critical 
for all applications stems from the fact that the channel 
of an OECT must perform two tasks: transport elec­
tronic charge (measured by μ) and store ionic charge 
(measured by C*). According to Equation 1, the fig­
ure of merit of the material is defined by the product 
of the charge-carrier mobility and volumetric capaci­
tance (μ·C*). For example, PEDOT:PSS with ethylene 
glycol has a μ·C* of 75 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 (REF. 17), whereas 
p‑type materials, such as p(g2T‑TT) (FIG. 2e), achieve 
a μ·C* of 228 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 (REF. 36). By contrast, n‑type 
materials, such as p(gNDI‑g2T) (FIG. 2f), have a μ·C* 
of ~0.1 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 (REF. 34). Decoupling the charge-
carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance can explain 
why one material outperforms the other177. For example, 
p(g2T‑TT) has a higher μ·C* than PEDOT:PSS because 
of a six times higher volumetric capacitance, but has a 
comparable hole mobility. p(gNDI‑g2T) has the high­
est reported C* (~400 F cm−3), but low electron mobility 
(~1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). A rule emerging from available 
materials is that even minimal hydrophilicity encour­
ages ion transport and therefore is a requirement for 
OECT materials14,34,36,45,178. However, hydrophobic self-
doped conjugated polyelectrolytes179 and poly(3‑hexyl­
thiophene) have also been used as channel materials in 
water-based OECTs172. Additionally, block copolymers 
or blends of semiconducting and ion-­conducting poly­
mers allow for the separate control of ion and elec­
tron transport180, which makes them interesting for 
OECTs. Finally, small molecules are envisioned to play 
a key role in the development of OECTs with tunable 
structure–function relationships.
OECTs have great design flexibility and can be manu­
factured by a variety of fabrication techniques, leading to 
different form factors compatible with low-cost, flexible, 
large-area and wearable applications. Advantages such as 
high transconductance, stability in aqueous electrolytes, 
cytocompatibility and facile biofunctionalization make 
them particularly suitable for bioelectronics. Materials 
with tailored biological properties, for example, mod­
ified with enzymes, can be used for OECT-based bio­
sensors. Although OECT-based biosensors have been

Figure 5 | Comparison between organic electrochemical 
transistors and organic field-effect transistors. The two 
devices are compared from the perspective of gain versus 
bandwidth. Typical organic electrochemical transistors 
(OECTs) show a transconductance, gm, in the range of 
millisiemens, but gm starts to roll off for frequencies higher 
than 1 kHz. Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) show a 
lower transconductance, but they can be operated at 
higher frequencies. The area under the pale blue curve 
indicates the frequency range in which OECTs have a 
performance advantage.

tested only in vitro so far, in vivo applications are envi­
sioned. OECTs can also be fabricated from materials that 
are optically transparent, allow electromechanical acti­
vation181 and leverage ion transport for drug delivery182, 
which makes them suitable as multimodal tools for cell 
monitoring. Three-dimensional cell culture platforms 
made of conducting polymers183 offer the opportunity 
to control the mechanical, biochemical and electrical 
microenvironment of a cell and to simultaneously mon­
itor cell behaviour. The combination of high-perfor­
mance OECT sensors with high-end silicon electronics 
through heterogeneous integration will facilitate the 
development of large multiplexed arrays for electrophys­
iology184. By contrast, simple OECT circuits interfaced 
with sensors for multiplexing, processing and amplifi­
cation will benefit from the simplicity of an all-organic 
technology and will be relevant to ‘quasi-static’ appli­
cations such as biosensor arrays. Ion gels, such as those 
used in organic FETs185, can render OECTs suitable for 
printed electronic applications. Moreover, the ability of 
OECTs to conduct large currents makes them interesting 
for applications in power electronics. Finally, the first 
devices for neuromorphic computing using OECTs have 
already been developed. The next step entails the scaling 
up of the number of devices and the scaling down of the 
individual device size to demonstrate the potential of 
OECT-based neuromorphic computing.
Finally, to discuss OECTs in relation to OFETs, the 
two devices represent the opposite ends of the same 
spectrum in terms of operation mechanism. They share 
many properties and are similar in terms of materi­
als, processes and form factors. However, OECTs are 
a considerably less mature technology than OFETs. 
When compared from a gain versus bandwidth per­
spective (FIG. 5), the transconductance of OECTs is larger 
than that of OFETs up to a certain frequency, beyond 
which OFETs have the performance advantage. For a 
typical microfabricated OECT (W × L = 10 × 10 μm2, 
d = 100 nm), the transconductance is in the range of mS 
and starts to roll off at kilohertz frequencies. An OFET 
of similar size with a hole mobility of 1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 
with C’ = 1 μF cm−2 (dielectric made of a self-assembled 
monolayer) has a transconductance of around 1 μS, 
which extends to megahertz frequencies. However, the 
transconductance of an OECT changes depending on 
the nature of the electrolyte; for example, a gel or solid 
electrolyte leads to slower devices. Therefore, the exact 
frequency at which OECTs lose the performance advan­
tage over OFETs depends on the nature of the electro­
lyte and therefore on the specific OECT design. Other 
metrics, such as the ON/OFF ratio, linearity of charac­
teristics, electrical stability and environmental stability, 
are difficult to compare because they have not been well 
studied for OECTs. Nevertheless, OECTs have a higher 
transconductance than OFETs up to a frequency well 
beyond their roll-off value, suggesting that they can 
replace OFETs in many applications. However, appli­
cations that require the highest possible frequencies, 
such as in radio frequency identification tags or display 
driving circuitry, remain difficult areas for the imple­
mentation of OECTs. Assuming a similar rate of progress 
for OECTs as for OFETs, the next few years will bring 
great progress in OECT technology, which could result 
in their commercialization.
