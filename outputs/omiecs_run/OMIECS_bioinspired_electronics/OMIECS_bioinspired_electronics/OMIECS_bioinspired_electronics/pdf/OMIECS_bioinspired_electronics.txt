Abstract
Owing to its close resemblance to biological systems and materials, soft 
matter has been successfully implemented in numerous bioelectronic 
and biosensing applications, as well as in bioinspired computing and 
neuromorphic electronics. Particularly, organic mixed ionic–electronic 
conductors possess favourable characteristics for their efficient use 
in organic electrochemical transistors, electrochemical memory and 
artificial synapses and neurons. Owing to their mixed ionic–electronic 
conduction, leading to high amplification, these materials are ideal 
for translating chemical signals, such as ions or neurotransmitters, 
into electrical signals, as well as for accurately controlling stable 
conductance states to efficiently emulate synaptic weights in artificial 
neural networks. Because these mixed conductors operate with ionic 
charges — similar to signalling in biological neuronal networks — they 
also exhibit ideal properties to emulate biological spiking neurons. 
In this Perspective, we consider the potential of soft matter, especially 
based on organic mixed conductors, for bioinspired systems and their 
possible applications. We discuss the potential that these materials 
have in applications in which low power, conformability and tunability 
are key, such as smart and adaptive biosensors, low-power in-sensor 
and edge computing, intelligent agents and robotics, and event-driven 
systems and biohybrid spiking circuits at the interface with biology. 
We present a comprehensive perspective of the potential of biomimetic 
and bioinspired electronics based on soft matter to integrate artificial 
intelligence into everyday life.

processes. Their soft mechanical properties render them ideal for 
interfacing with biological systems.
We have now reached a critical volume of scholarship in organic 
bioinspired materials and electronics that leverage organic mixed 
conductors. The artificial counterparts of the basic building blocks 
of biological neural networks — that is, organic artificial synapses 
and neurons — are readily available and are highly tuneable and 
multi-responsive19–22. Such elements enable the realization of on-chip, 
small-scale artificial neural networks with parallelism in training23. 
Organic neuromorphic architectures emulate high-order phenom-
ena of biological neural networks such as homoeostasis24, functional 
connectivity and synchrony25,26, while displaying multi-stable energy 
states essential for adaptive and intelligent behaviour19. Biorealistic 
organic neuromorphic electronics21,22, adaptive sensors and systems 
for local processing and computation are now closer than ever27,28. 
Real-time biohybrid interfaces showcase the synergetic operation of 
biological and artificial counterparts for multi-functional and bidi-
rectional bio-interfaces29,30. The evolvable nature of soft matter is now 
leveraged for in materio computing31 and for the natural-like growth 
(metabolite-driven) of functional materials into living organisms32. 
Finally, organic neuromorphic devices are incorporated in behavioural 
aspects of intelligent agents with soft, biomimetic (and potentially 
self-healable) actuators and adaptive circuitry for on-chip learning in 
robotics33. These advancements are encouraging, but the challenges 
remain great and multidimensional ranging from basic science to 
technological implementation. The full potential of organic bioin-
spired electronics for emulating and interfacing biology, and thus for 
fulfilling the considerable endeavour of “diverse forms of intelligence 
everywhere”, is yet to be unravelled.
In this Perspective, we present an overview of the state of the art 
and the novel potential domains of biomimetic and bioinspired elec-
tronics based on OMIECs. Such bioinspired electronics can enable new 
intelligent systems that are able to sense, analyse, interpret, perceive 
and act upon a dynamic and diverse real-world environment. The aim of 
this work is to provide a unique and broad perspective of the potential 
of organic bioinspired materials and electronics based on their distinc-
tive properties. We argue that soft electrochemical matter may also 
provide less conventional but essential manifestations of biological 
intelligence, far beyond what conventional artificial networks can cur-
rently offer. Potential future directions and long-term ramifications, as 
well as challenges towards real-world applications, are also discussed.
Materials characteristics: organic mixed 
conductors and beyond
Because of their unique properties, organic materials could facilitate 
the development of neuromorphic technologies to emulate diverse 
forms of biological intelligence (Fig. 1). In particular, organics are highly 
tuneable via synthesis and additives34. For example, the volatility (that 
is, the memory) of a neuromorphic device based on OMIECs can be 
engineered with molecular additives and dopants19,35–37. Host–guest 
chemistry can induce ion-selective interactions in (semi)conduct-
ing polymers, reminiscent of biological ion channels38–40. Moreover, 
conjugated polymers can be synthesized with mixed conductivity that 
displays unipolar, ambipolar or antiambipolar carrier transport22,41,42, 
phenomena that are essential for inducing diverse nonlinear behaviour 
at the device level to more accurately replicate the brain processing 
capabilities.
The high tunability of soft matter can enable diverse functions 
for bioinspired electronics. Materials properties (such as electrical 
Introduction
The nervous system is indisputably competent when coping with 
diverse environmental stimuli and converting them into internal 
neuronal representations, in order to perceive the environment, take 
actions and control the body efficiently. Driven by the efficiency of 
biological systems, a sensible approach for the current high demand 
of integrating physically artificial forms of intelligence into everyday 
life is representing the functions of the nervous system with biomimetic 
or neuromorphic materials, electronics and systems1–6. Instead of exe-
cuting neuronal algorithms on classic computing systems7,8, biological 
phenomena are mapped directly on such dedicated biomimetic or 
neuromorphic technologies. The benefits of this bioinspired, in mate-
rio or on-chip integration are multiple and straightforward: efficient 
intelligence can be potentially embodied in any kind of unconventional 
form factor that is often inaccessible with conventional electronics9–11. 
Artificial neural networks based on analogue memory crossbar arrays, 
for example, represent a promising approach to emulating simpli-
fied functions of biological neural networks4,6. Drawing inspiration 
from neuroscience, spiking neural networks utilize spike timing and 
spike-rate processing of signals between artificial neurons — adding  
a ‘temporal’ component to artificial neural networks — to create 
efficient intelligent systems that attempt to emulate more precisely 
the workings of the brain2,12. Hardware-based realizations of spiking 
neural networks necessitate the creation of both artificial neurons 
and synapses. The former act as the primary computational units 
within the network, generating, processing and transmitting electri-
cal impulses (or spikes) through synapses. Synapses act as memory 
units, regulating the strength of the connections between neurons 
through short-term synaptic plasticity and long-term synaptic plasticity 
or modulatory effects. In principle, hardware-based artificial networks 
can be highly energy efficient for local learning, classification and 
processing. Therefore, they are promising for low-power, stand-alone 
and edge computing applications.
Artificial networks based on traditional, solid-state neuromor-
phic systems are known to be efficient in dealing with temporal, 
biological-like signals. However, the computational power of bio-
logical networks also stems from their diverse carriers of informa-
tion (ions, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and so on), their 
stochasticity and crosstalk and/or noise via the wetware. Indeed, 
brain chemistry can be very diverse with at least several tens of neuro­
transmitters and hundreds of corresponding receptors13. Although 
there are excellent and robust artificial networks based on solid-state 
electronics, the abovementioned biorealistic features are missing 
from traditional neuromorphic technologies. Many other aspects 
of biological intelligence that are manifestations of the biological 
machinery are also absent, such as self-healing ability, vulnerability 
and physical evolvability. Organic materials, alternatively, do possess 
many of these characteristics and are now being incorporated in neu-
romorphic technologies. Soft matter and organic compounds are of 
particular interest because of their close resemblance to the biological 
machinery. Organic materials such as small molecules, oligomers and 
polymers can be used to make dielectrics, semiconductors, mixed 
conductors and electrolytes. Their corresponding devices or systems 
can potentially be the basis for materializing diverse forms of biologi-
cal intelligence14–18. Although many different materials classes can be 
used for bioinspired electronics, organic mixed conductors and, in 
particular, organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs) 
seem to be a natural choice as they do not only mimic the biological 
behaviour but also operate with similar underlying electrochemical

conductance) can be modulated in operando and in analogue fashion, 
and thus form the basis for device trainability, adaptivity and learning, 
and for the realization of on-chip neural networks19,23. The tunability 
of soft matter also enables the realization of artificial sensorimotor 
systems, bio-interfaces or robotics with diverse properties (electrical, 
optical, mechanical, thermal or biochemical). Multi-responsive, 
multimodal systems that exploit interdependent and cross-coupled 
properties (such as optoelectronic, thermoelectric, electrochemi-
cal, electromechanical or piezoelectric properties)43,44 can form sen-
sory associations, conversions or effector–motor actions by handling 
diverse (input–input or input–output) signalling. Moreover, soft and 
stretchable films for organic electronics, such as semiconductors 
or OMIECs, can offer conformable and intimate interfacing with a 
diversity of substrates and objects (biological tissues, soft robotics 
or macroscopic structures)45–47. Soft matter can also spontaneously 
self-heal after having been mechanically damaged owing to intermo-
lecular or ionic interactions and to the low activation energies needed 
for (macro)molecular (re)association48,49. Self-healing and regenera-
tion are inherently embedded in biology — being a key differentiator 
from the rigid and pre-defined technologies of modern electronics —  
and is an essential property for enabling long-life intelligence and 
homoeostasis in artificial systems. However, beyond self-healing, 
soft materials are vulnerable and prone to injuries. The mirroring of 
an aversive state such as an injury between peer systems — intelligent 
systems with similar capabilities, developing an injured–observer 
interaction — via soft electrochemical matter might provide a path for 
artificial empathy, and thus prevent the sociopathic behaviour of intel-
ligent systems50. Empathy is an important aspect and can potentially 
offer instruction-free behaviour in artificial intelligent systems mostly 
focused on the preservation of their well-being. Indeed, an aversive 
state between biological peers, such as the sight of blood or being at 
the edge of a height, might trigger real biochemical reactions at the 
observer side, which could be mirrored in artificial systems with soft 
electrochemical matter.
The bottom–up processes and the complexity of soft matter 
can enable computation in (bio)matter. Often, the formation of soft 
matter happens easily owing to the low-energy barriers involved, 
and can be assisted (catalysed) or spontaneously initiated at room 
temperature. Under these conditions, soft matter can evolve over space 
and time under the influence of triggering cues such as physical and 
chemical stimuli, catalysts or thermal energy32,51,52. The evolvability of 
soft electrochemical matter is a key property to emulate the phenom-
enon of synaptogenesis. The development of soft matter can even 
be guided in a bottom–up fashion with metabolically driven growth 
processes that are compatible with living organisms32. This guided 
growth can potentially lead to the physical fusion of soft electrochemi-
cal matter with living organisms. Typically, soft matter is amorphous 
or polycrystalline and, therefore, exhibits complex and distributed 
dynamic processes at the microscale or nanoscale (such as variable 
hopping frequencies and distances or relaxation times, cascade-like 
phenomena, recurrent interactions and so on). This dynamic complex-
ity is a necessary condition for a material to incorporate computing and 
processing abilities, allowing the transformation of inputs into a more 
complex computational space for in materio realization31,53.
Soft matter can enable unconventional functions and forms for 
bioinspired devices and circuits. Because the operation of organic 
devices based on OMIECs involves natural-like processes such as the 
transport of alkaline and polyatomic ions in water-based electrolytes54, 
device and circuit metrics (including characteristic timescales 
and voltages) can be on par with those of biologically occurring 
phenomena15. This can endow OMIEC-based neuromorphic devices and 
circuits with energy efficiency and real-time bio-interoperability (for 
example, bidirectional responsivity to common biological carriers of 
information such as ions, neurotransmitters and biomarkers)15,18,21,22,29. 
In a direction that is in sharp contrast with the ultra-high integration 
density and extremely low fault tolerance of contemporary nanoelec-
tronics, organic neuromorphic devices are compatible with large-area 
integration on flexible or even stretchable subtrates45,55. This compat-
ibility is a key form factor for conformally distributing intelligence in 
uneven macroscopic structures and bodies.
Bioinspired devices and organic building blocks
Organic neuromorphic devices based on OMIECs come in different 
forms, with the most prominent ones being the organic electrochemi-
cal transistors (OECTs) and organic electrochemical resistive access 
memories (OEC-RAMs) (Fig. 2). Typically, OECT and OEC-RAM have 
similar architecture; they both are three-terminal devices consisting 
of a channel between the source (S) and drain (D) electrodes, and an 
electrolyte (solid, gel or liquid) between the channel and the gate (G) 
electrode (Fig. 2a). However, OECTs are volatile devices, which means 
that they do not store information (in the form of ionic charge, Fig. 2b), 
whereas OEC-RAMs are a form of non-volatile OECTs and display per-
manent charge storage or memory phenomena (Fig. 2c). Therefore, 
OEC-RAMs enable for the realization of artificial synapses and their cor-
responding networks, whereas volatile OECTs are the building blocks 
for analogue circuits. In the latter case, OECTs are building blocks for 
electrochemical oscillatory circuits to create organic artificial neurons 
(Fig. 2d). Table 1 shows representative metrics and desired proper-
ties for OEC-RAMs and organic artificial neurons. Considerations for 
standardization of metrics for OECRAMs and organic artificial neurons 
are shown in Table 2.
Organic electrochemical transistors
OMIECs are predominantly pi-conjugated polymers (for electronic 
conduction) that readily solvate and conduct ions. The inherent ionic–
electronic coupling in OMIECs facilitates very efficient transduction 
from ionic to electronic signals and vice versa, which enables the 
low-voltage operation of OECTs, making them versatile chemical sen-
sors. We describe the underlying electrochemical processes occurring 
in OMIECs in Box 1, including the doping and dedoping mechanisms 
and the formation of the volumetric capacitance. Here, we focus on 
OMIEC developments directly related to their use in OECTs for neuro-
morphic and biomimetic systems, including the design of tailor-made 
synthetic materials, the development of new models to describe their 
unconventional properties, and the exploration of novel deposition 
techniques. Each of these developments aim to exploit the biomimetic 
functionalities of OMIEC-based devices on a different level of abstrac-
tion when compared to biology, underlining the necessity of synergistic 
progress to build complex bioinspired systems.
The prototypical material used in OECTs is poly(3,4-ethylene-
dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)34. However, 
owing to the permanent presence of immobilized sulfonate anions in 
PEDOT:PSS, it is intrinsically p-type doped, resulting in depletion mode 
transistors, which alone is unfavourable for most analogue or digital 
circuits because of the continuous power consumption at the idle 
state of transistor operation. Indeed, to build power-efficient circuits 
such as inverters, amplifiers and biomimetic spiking neurons with 
OECTs, p-type and n-type accumulation mode transistors are required.

Complementary circuits that combine p-type and n-type devices (and 
accumulation or depletion modes of operation) are power-efficient 
because they dissipate low power when idle (they combine on and off 
operation for idle conditions). Conjugated polymer electrolytes (CPEs), 
such as glycolated polythiophenes56 or glycolated donor–acceptor 
copolymers57, have become known as excellent OMIECs for p-type accu-
mulation mode OECTs, allowing the application of known molecular 
design guidelines derived from the development of semiconducting 
polymers of organic thin-film transistors. Modifying the length and 
distribution of the glycolated side chains represents an efficient way to 
influence the ionic–electronic interaction and the operational stabil-
ity of the devices58. In particular, because CPEs are homogeneous on 
a molecular level (unlike PEDOT:PSS), they show the highest degree 
of swelling and the highest product of charge carrier mobility and 
volumetric capacitance (µC*), which is an important figure of merit 
for OMIECs59. Furthermore, tuning the frontier orbitals or the side 
chains of the conjugated polymer backbone enables a certain control 
of the threshold voltage (although there is a compromise with stability 
and µC*)56,57. Alternatively, chemical doping with molecular additives 
may be used for threshold voltage control60.
Building stable n-type organic transistors is notoriously more dif-
ficult than building p-type devices as n-type materials are more prone 
to oxidation, a fact that also holds true for OMIECs61. The benchmark 
OMIEC for n-type OECTs is poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthrol
ine) (BBL) because of its high µC* product62. Important progress has 
been made to develop pre-doped BBL inks, improving environmental 
and operational stability and providing additional control over the 
threshold voltage62. However, BBL typically forms nanoparticles, which 
may lead to variability or poor performance, and is typically dissolved 
in highly acidic environments, raising issues regarding its biocom-
patibility and compatibility with other polymers. As a consequence, 
deposition methods such as screen printing or inkjet printing typi-
cally result in inhomogeneities and poor device performance63, and 
alternative deposition processes that improve homogeneity have to 
be adapted and evaluated. Hence, finding alternatives to BBL is desira-
ble, and known molecular design strategies were used to develop stable  
n-type OMIECs, such as copolymers based on naphthalenediimide 
(NDI)42,64, small molecules such as perylene65, or C60 with glycolated 
side chains66. However, the remaining challenge is to increase the µC* 
product of these materials to balance the performance of p-type and 
n-type devices. Indeed, for building complementary building blocks 
made of p-type and n-type devices, their performance characteristics 
should be comparable.
Another approach for complementary circuits is using ambipo-
lar OMIECs27 such as donor–acceptor copolymers with glycolated 
side chains. These materials are usually composed of polythiophene 
donor and NDI or diketopyrrolopyrrole acceptor units67–69, or blends 
of p-type polymer-based OECTs and small-molecule n-type OMIECs70. 
However, although high-gain inverters have been demonstrated using 
ambipolar OMIECs, they tend to show unfavourable S-shaped output 
curves and limited rail-to-rail switching, if p-type and n-type operations 
are not balanced70,71.
Effects such as nonlinear electrical characteristics cannot readily 
be described by established models for OECTs and OMIECs but are 
rather a manifestation of correlation effects that emerge at high 
charge carrier densities. For example, the Gauss-like shape obtained 
in BBL-based OECTs can be assigned to an energy gap emerging owing 
to Coulomb interactions at high polaron densities72. Another interest-
ing observation, promising applications in event-based computation 
and associative learning, is the appearance of a hysteretic behaviour 
in the transfer curve of OECTs spanning over several orders of mag-
nitude in time37,73. An approach to describe the operation of OECTs 
within the framework of thermodynamics is deriving the current–
voltage curve from Gibbs free energy74. This approach was experi-
mentally motivated by time-dependent and temperature-dependent 
spectroelectrochemical investigations75,76. The developed thermo-
dynamic model not only accounts for the entropy of the doping and 
dedoping processes but also includes enthalpic terms that can be used 
to describe Coulomb attraction or repulsion between charged species. 
Therefore, such thermodynamic considerations may provide a more 
general framework for the description of OECTs capturing interactions 
on a nanoscopic level. Furthermore, combining such thermodynamic 
models with in operando characterization will allow researchers to 
derive more general structure–property relationships77. Ultimately, 
kinetic effects need to be included in the future to describe the transient 
properties of OECTs entirely.
Electrochemical random-access memories as organic artificial 
synapses
The realization of artificial neural networks also requires, as building 
blocks, the development of artificial synapses. Commonly, these sys-
tems have been demonstrated with solid-state memristive devices78,79, 
a class of two-terminal devices with conductance levels that can be 
tuned in a non-volatile manner by applying electrical pulses. However, 
the conductance switching of these materials is inherently stochas-
tic, which substantially reduces control and requires program and

Fig. 2 | Organic neuromorphic devices and building blocks based on organic 
mixed ionic–electronic conductors. a, Generic schematic of an organic 
electrochemical device based on organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors 
(OMIECs). Organic electrochemical neuromorphic devices can be volatile 
(such as an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)) or non-volatile (such 
as an organic electrochemical resistive access memory (OEC-RAM)). b, OECT. 
The presence of ions in OMIECs (from an electrolyte) modulates the hole density 
of the polymer. At the device level, this ionic–electronic coupling is translated 
into a change of the drain current versus gate voltage (ID versus VG) or a change of 
the transconductance versus gate voltage (gm versus VG) curve. The ion injection 
(application of VG) and ion back flow (removal of VG) are fully reversible and 
the device is volatile (indicated by the long dashed lines with arrowheads in 
panel a). c, OEC-RAM. The output current of the device ID can be tuned in an 
analogue fashion under the influence of input voltage pulses VG. OEC-RAMs 
are non-volatile and state retention is ensured with an access device (switch, 
transistor and so on) between the gate and the channel, imposing an open 
circuit potential or an energy barrier that prevents ion back flow (indicated by 
the short dashed line with arrowhead in panel a). d, Organic artificial neurons.

across the axon. Biological neurons are immersed in an aqueous electrolyte, 
which is a noisy reservoir that contains various carriers for signalling. Ion

decoupled and charges are trapped to achieve the non-volatile tuning 
of the channel. The most prominent demonstrations of EC-RAM were 
based on PEDOT:PTHF35,37, PEDOT:PSS19 (organic) and on Li-transition 
metal oxide (inorganic)90. OEC-RAMs closely resemble the common 
organic electrochemical transistor, with a high-capacitance polymer 
gate replacing the conventionally used gates19. An array of OEC-RAMs 
with inorganic access devices allows for parallel programming23,91. 
Like OECTs, OEC-RAMs are compatible with lithographic and addi-
tive manufacturing processes (inkjet, 3D printing)34,92 and can be 
potentially integrated in diverse substrates, surfaces and objects 
as they are flexible, stretchable and can be integrated in small or 
large scale93.
The third terminal of OEC-RAMs allows for the reproducible and 
well-controlled insertion of ions, which ensures greater overall predict-
ability of the conductance19. The electrochemical doping process, how-
ever, results in undesired side effects. The most important ones include 
nonlinear or non-symmetric tuning (deviations from ideal behaviour), 
low stability and retention owing to parasitic side reactions such as 
oxidation, and relatively low operating speeds as ions are less mobile 
than electrons and holes. The latter has been overcome by scaling down 
device dimensions and using fast electrolytes such as ionic liquids94. 
Non-ideal tuning characteristics can also be mitigated by utilizing part 
of the conduction range — in which the tuning is linear95 — or by using 
current pulses96.
The comparably low state retention resulting from parasitic reac-
tions remains the most important challenge of OEC-RAMs. Because 
conductance tuning is electrochemically driven, the stable range of 
conductance is limited by ambient conditions such as the presence 
of oxygen97. This effect is more pronounced for small-scale devices. 
Another source for limited state retention originates from the fact 
that OEC-RAMs are essentially non-equilibrium devices, which means 
that state retention is based on the ionic charge separation between 
the gate and the channel. In this case, the developed internal electric 
fields and gradients of ionic charges between gate and channel also 
contribute to the gradual state loss. In addition, some organic mixed 
conducting materials such as PEDOT:PSS are blends which can lead 
to composition variability between different volumes, thus posing 
a fundamental limit for scaling98. State retention is enhanced by the 
external access device that is necessary to prevent ion back flow. Dop-
ing PEDOT with a less (ion) conductive phase can lead to an access 
device-free configuration35. Electrolytes with high ionic resistance 
such as polydopamine can prolongate state retention with an access 
device-free configuration (that is, without external access device)99. 
Similarly, a partially crystalline mixed conductor that can trap ions 
in the crystalline domains of the material was used to prevent ion 
back flow100. However, these approaches reduce the electrochemical 
operational window and, thus, introduce a trade-off between the on–off 
ratio and stability.
At the same time, with sufficiently accurate electronics and noise 
kept to a minimum, it is possible to reduce the conductance range to 
be within a proper electrochemical range to avoid undesired reac-
tions with oxygen and water97. Alternatively, reactions with oxygen 
can be eliminated with device encapsulation101, although it requires 
complex processes such as the deposition of multilayers. An alterna-
tive to prevent electronic charges to move in the electronic periph-
eral circuit is to trap the ions in their meta-stable electrochemical 
states102, thus also resulting in the trapping of electronic charges in 
the channel. Other important metrics for OEC-RAMs are the dynamic 
range, device-to-device variability, cycling stability and energy 
consumption. However, comparing certain metrics across different 
reported results is extremely difficult and can strongly depend on 
the measurement conditions. As an example, long-term potentiation 
is sometimes reported as the residual conductance difference, but 
also, and arguably more useful, as a measure of a stable conductance 
state modulation almost instantly after an applied pulse. Whereas the 
former can have use in mimicking short-term plasticity phenomena 
(for example, in spiking neural networks), the latter is essential for 
tuning synaptic weights in hardware-based artificial neural networks 
and in-memory computing. Therefore, a definition of proper device 
metrology is essential (Table 2). As an example, in the case of report-
ing analogue programming of OEC-RAMs, real non-volatile reading 
of a memory state is ensured during a write–read–write cycle when 
steady state is reached after a write event. Moreover, the type of 
access device that drives the OEC-RAM should be reported in detail, 
but also considered in the estimation of switching energy per event. 
When reporting retention time, it is important to ensure that read-
ing events do not disturb the memory state level. Finally, retention

time (or memory loss) is usually state dependant because OEC-RAMs 
are non-equilibrium devices, and reporting a single retention time 
is incomplete. Therefore, retention time should refer to a specific 
memory state.
Organic artificial neurons
Organic artificial neurons can be realized with electrochemical circuits 
made of volatile OECTs. Various models of hardware-based spiking 
neurons, including integrate-and-fire model or Hodgkin–Huxley model, 
have been developed to describe the generation of spikes in biological 
neurons with varying degrees of accuracy103. Despite their differences, 
these models all simulate how the membrane potential integrates cur-
rents from incoming spikes and generates new spikes once a certain 
threshold is exceeded. In contrast to artificial spiking neurons based 
on silicon2, metal oxides104, 1D and 2D materials105 or solid-state organic 
semiconductors106, the OMIEC implementation of these neurons offers 
various benefits, such as improved biocompatibility and ion-based 
and chemical-based operating mechanisms such as those found in 
biological systems (Fig. 2d). Therefore, such organic artificial neurons 
can more realistically emulate the behaviour of biological neurons in 
the wetware (Fig. 2d).
To implement biomimetic spiking neurons with OECTs, the reali-
zation of circuit building blocks with nonlinear behaviour is required 
(Fig. 2d). To obtain nonlinear behaviour for neuromorphic behaviour, 
p-type and n-type devices with balanced transport properties and 
steep subthreshold behaviour are required. These properties are ideal 
for the design of low-voltage inverters107, which are essential compo-
nents of biologically plausible neuron models such as the Axon-Hillock 
neuron20,21 or Morris–Lecar neuron108. For an even more complex relaxa-
tion oscillator, that is, the Hodgkin–Huxley neuron, precise adjust-
ment of the threshold voltage is needed to balance the different ion 
channels and obtain stable oscillations. OECTs show several interest-
ing properties in their electrical characteristics, typically not seen in 
conventional field-effect transistors, that might lead to very efficient 
hardware-based implementations of neuromorphic computing. For 
example, OECTs often show a saturation behaviour in their transfer 
characteristics74,109, which might be used to mimic the sigmoidal shape 
of the activation function of a neuron. For even more interesting non-
linear (non-monotonic) behaviour, a Gauss-shaped transfer curve 
with negative transconductance has been observed in heavily doped 
BBL-based OECTs72, and an S-shaped negative differential resistance 
has been shown in a cascade connection of OECTs with feedback. Such 
(non-monotonic) response can potentially emulate more realistic 
neuronal functions. Indeed, these nonlinear behaviours have been 
used to mimic the opening and closing of ion channels in a neuron and 
neuronal excitability, for a biorealistic neuronal implementation21,22.
The first attempt to develop artificial spiking neurons using 
OMIECs utilized a leaky integrate-and-fire design, using an Axon-Hillock 
circuit based on all-printed complementary OECTs20. An inverter build-
ing block made of a p-type and an n-type OECT is required for this 
neuron (Fig. 2d). The actual configuration of this artificial neuron 
requires two sequential stages of inverter blocks with feedback, defin-
ing a minimal topology of an electrochemical ring oscillator20. These 
artificial organic electrochemical neurons (OECNs) displayed various 
neuronal features, such as ion concentration-dependent spiking and 
spike timing-dependent plasticity, when combined with organic elec-
trochemical synapses. Because of the low-voltage swing, ion-mediated 
spiking and high compatibility with biological systems, OECNs 
can interface with the bio-signalling systems of bio-membranes21, 
plants20 and invertebrates22 to record and/or control their electro-
physiology upon input of stimuli. However, as integrate-and-fire model 
neurons cannot replicate the rich temporal dynamics of biological neu-
rons, they can only simulate a restricted range of neural characteristics 
such as regular firing.

Carrier transport and coupling in mixed organic ionic–electronic 
conductors
Conduction of electronic and ionic charges does not happen 
separately in organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors 
(OMIECs)144,145. Indeed, there is an inherent coupling between 
both species, and the development of a profound understanding 
of this coupling is essential for the description of organic 
electrochemical transistors, being the bedrock of bioinspired 
electronics. In OMIECs, intramolecular transport of electronic 
charges occurs along the pi-conjugated core of the constituent 
molecules (such as the delocalized transport along the conjugated 
backbone of a polymer), and intermolecular transport is governed  
by the overlap of pi orbitals of neighbouring molecules146. In most 
OMIECs, though, static and dynamic disorders are intrinsic factors, 
making thermally activated hopping the dominant electronic 
transport mechanism. Ionic transport in OMIECs is generally more 
complex than electronic transport (see the figure), and mechanisms 
are material-specific and whether the OMIEC is in a dry or wet 
state. For example, as OMIECs swell when in contact with a liquid 
electrolyte, solvated ions (surrounded by their hydration shell) 
can drift or diffuse through the OMIEC, and the diffusion constant 
in the material might be as high as that in the pure liquid phase 
(D = 10−5 cm2 s−1)147. In the dry state, though, either ions are fully 
immobilized or they only move through the OMIEC via hopping 
transport (D = 10−10 cm2 s−1, transport either mediated by defects 
or ion-coordinated entities148,149). However, other ion transport 
mechanisms are also possible, for example, the Grotthuss mechanism 
for protons. As ions move through the OMIEC, they may influence 
the density of electronic charges on the pi-conjugated polymer 
via faradaic and non-faradaic processes (see the figure). In fact, 
OMIECs are often considered to be either ideally faradaic or 
non-faradaic (which simplifies the description). In reality, both 
processes occur side by side. In the case of an ideal non-faradaic 
process, the excess ions in the OMIEC are neutralized by electronic 
charges (polarons) on the conjugated backbone in order to satisfy 
charge neutrality. Hence, the excess ion and the stabilized polaron 
form an electrochemical double layer. This process is also referred 
to as stabilization of the electronic charge via the excess ion or 
electrochemical doping. As this process happens throughout the 
entire thickness of the OMIEC layer, the electrochemical capacitance, 
which is a measure of the strength of the ionic–electronic coupling, 
is a quantity that scales with the volume of the film. Hence, it is 
denoted as volumetric capacitance C* in the literature. In order 
to define a figure of merit for the OECT operation accounting for 
the electronic transport and the strength of the ionic–electronic 
coupling, the product µC* of the electronic mobility and 
volumetric capacitance has been widely accepted59. The advantage 
of the µC* product is that it does not require independent 
measurement of mobility and volumetric capacitance. It can be 
readily determined from the transconductance (gm = dID/dVG)  
by measuring the transfer curve (drain current ID over gate–source 
voltage VG)34.

Another method for producing biorealistic spiking neurons 
involves leveraging the nonlinear properties of two p-type thiophene- 
based OECTs — a depletion mode and an enhancement mode transistor —  
connected in a cascade-like configuration with feedback resistors21. 
This generic configuration produces a two-terminal organic electro­
chemical nonlinear block with S-shaped negative differential resist-
ance response (Fig. 2d). When the nonlinear element is coupled at its 
negative resistance regime to an external load of positive impedance, 
the whole circuit bifurcates (that is, resonates) and forms an oscil-
latory circuit, the organic artificial spiking neuron21. The artificial 
neuron is capable of generating action potentials that resemble those 
of biological neurons with frequencies in the range of 5–70 Hz. The 
nonlinear behaviour of these devices enables a biorealistic emulation 
of the excitability and dynamics of neurons in the biological wetware in 
biophysically relevant ion concentration ranges. Another implementa-
tion of artificial spiking neurons with OMIECs involves the development 
of biorealistic conductance-based organic electrochemical neurons 
(c-OECNs)22. These neurons leverage the highly tuneable, stable and 
reversible antiambipolar character of BBL-based OECTs (Gauss-like 
response, Fig. 2d) at high electrochemical doping levels to introduce 
the complex activation–inactivation dynamics of biological sodium 
channels in the spiking mechanisms of OECNs. The antiambipolar 
character of BBL induces a negative differential transconductance 
OECT response, which is utilized for nonlinear phenomena and circuit 
resonance (that is, oscillations of the artificial neuron)22. These c-OECNs 
can produce spiking patterns at biologically plausible frequencies 
of up to 100 Hz, emulate 15 out of 20 neural features and exhibit  
stochastic spiking.
The spiking behaviour of these biorealistic electrochemical neu-
rons can be modulated by various factors, including ions (concentration 
and type of ions), amino acids and neurotransmitters, as well as 
electrochemical noise (Fig. 2d). They can also be synergistically inte-
grated with bio-membranes to form real-time biohybrid interfaces and 
be used for the in vivo stimulation of biological nerves. This integration 
makes them suitable as event-based (bio)sensors, allowing the conver-
sion of biochemical signals into a language that living systems can 
interpret. In this context, the high sensitivity of OECTs to a wide range of 
(bio-)chemical and physical stimuli could aid in easy signal transduction 
and sensory fusion at the neurons’ level without requiring additional 
hardware110–112. In the long-term, such biorealistic, multi-functional and 
multi-responsive artificial neurons can form the basis for the emula-
tion, restoration or even the augmentation of biorhythmicity, aiming 
at intelligent bio-interfaces and neuroprosthetics.

the most energy-costly step (the multiply–accumulate step, or vector 
matrix multiplication step) by performing it directly in hardware4. 
There has been an abundance in reported applications of these 
(or similar) non-volatile devices, ranging from hardware convolutional 
neural networks113 to long-term and short-term memory networks114 
and partial differential equation solvers114, mostly using phase change 
or resistive memories. Owing to their linearity in programming, the 
analogue tuning of their conductance levels and their low-voltage 
operation, organic artificial synapses are promising candidates 
for the realization of artificial neural networks (Fig. 3a). However, 
organic neuromorphic electronics can exhibit device-to-device vari-
ability when developed in an academic environment, which can be 
an issue when scaling to larger arrays. Nevertheless, the use of large 
conductance windows and analogue tuning, combined with rela-
tively forgiving (and fault tolerant) neural network operations and 
algorithmic co-development,115 can partially relax the need for low 
variability and fault tolerance that is usually required in conventional 
electronics.
Apart from aqueous electrolytes, several solid electrolytes have 
also been introduced, particularly based on ionic liquids in poly-
mer matrices94. Although aqueous electrolytes are relevant for wet 
bio-interfaces, solid electrolytes are suitable for the development 
of circuits and arrays in combination with more complex peripheral 
electronics. One particular challenge is developing a patternable 
solid electrolyte to allow upscaling of (crossbar) arrays and prevent 
device-to-device crosstalk and current sneak paths during write–
read–inference operations73. Although sneak paths in crossbar arrays 
can be prevented by implementing access devices23, it is important to 
note that aggressive integration of OEC-RAM-based circuits beyond 
proof-of-principle small arrays requires a combined effort of optimized 
peripheral electronic circuit design and dedicated software tools for 
device access. To achieve the highest energy gains, parallel updating 
needs to be implemented, which requires some form of novel combi-
nation of block writing as only certain combination of devices can be 
individually addressed23.
The most common algorithm in neural networks and deep learning 
has been the backpropagation algorithm with gradient descent7. How-
ever, implementing this in hardware (beyond single-layer perceptrons) 
is far from trivial as it requires storing partial derivatives of the weights 
in hardware as well, though workarounds and hybrid forms have been 
reported. Alternative algorithms such as evolutionary strategies to 
determine hyperparameters or train spiking neural networks could 
also prove useful for OEC-RAM devices that require low power and 
are easy to tune113,116.
Global–local phenomena. The coupling of several OMIEC-based 
neuromorphic devices via an electrolyte might herald a new era of 
neuromorphic computing (in liquido computing52) in which local 
mechanisms such as synaptic plasticity or neuronal activity and 
global regulation (or homoeostasis) are exploited for the imple-
mentation of efficient learning rules and biorealistic neuromorphic 
functionalities24–26,117 (Fig. 3b). As an example, a shared electrolyte 
between OMIEC-based neuromorphic devices allows for parallel elec-
trochemical interactions between them through the electrolyte con-
tinuum, and thus wire-free device-to-device ‘soft’ interconnections25,117. 
A global electrochemical oscillation at this shared electrolyte can 
synchronize an array of devices in a similar way as the brain oscilla-
tions synchronize the activity of neural populations26. Such global–
local coupling phenomena can enable highly diverse neuromorphic 
architectures in which the topology of the structural network can be 
modulated flexibly and dynamically depending on transient global 
activities or even on the state of the coupling medium.
Bottom–up neuromorphic networks. Neuromorphic functionalities 
using OMIECs may be obtained not only on the single-device level 
(neuron or synapse) but also possibly on the network scale using 
bottom–up processes such as electropolymerization starting from 
a monomer-containing solution (Fig. 3c). For example, an electropo-
lymerization method was developed for PEDOT, allowing the directed 
growth of fibres with a length of several millimetres and a controlled 
diameter in a liquid environment118. This technique was later modi-
fied to grow ‘evolvable’ OECTs, thereby mimicking the process of 
synaptogenesis51,53. In fact, the time constants of synaptic plasticity in 
the electropolymerized fibre structures can be tuned by the growth 
conditions (voltage amplitude and input frequency), enabling learn-
ing on the timescale from milliseconds to hours. A chemical polym-
erization approach was also used for the in vivo growth of CPE fibres 
acting as a bioelectronic interface119, and similar in vivo fabrication 
was used to create soft substrate-free conducting materials within 
the biological environment via metabolite-driven polymerization32. 
Evolvable networks have even been transferred to the level of com-
plete neural networks. For example, electropolymerization has been 
used to build organic pattern classifiers120 or nonlinear random neural 
networks acting as a physical reservoir for real-time classification of 
bio-signals31,121–123.
Overall, combining complexity in materials caused by correlation 
effects at high charge carrier densities resulting in negative differential 
transconductance and structural complexity might herald a new era of 
neuromorphic computing going away from the current paradigm 
of synapse-centred computation towards dendrocentric learning, by 
taking into account actual computations taking place at the dendrites 
of neurons124.
Learning, sensing and bio-interfacing
Sensorimotor learning and environmental intelligence. Apart from 
the widely used algorithmic implementation with software-based 
neural networks, learning can be incorporated on-chip using signals 
directly from the environment via external sensors. One example 
includes sensorimotor integration, a form of associative learning 
in which several external signals are combined and associated 
(input–input or input–output associations) to adapt to a changing 
environment and optimize the performance of a system with embod-
ied intelligence (that is, the target behaviour of a mobile robot)33. 
In this particular example, learning occurs locally on an organic 
neuromorphic circuit in real-time and in a closed-loop fashion, by 
exposing the circuit directly on environmental signals with iterative 
interaction33. With this sensorimotor integration, a robot in a maze 
can gradually learn to associate the presence of navigation cues with 
turning decisions at the maze intercepts and gradually escapes from 
the maze.
Local and/or distributed learning and sensorimotor control 
can be enhanced substantially by using low-power and easy-to-tune 
neuro­morphic materials and devices. Delocalizing such properties 
(that is, distributing spatially on the body of an intelligent system) and 
using self-healable, flexible, stretchable polymers can potentially lead 
to more robust systems with lifelong intelligence that are tolerant to 
mechanical damages48,125. Local training and learning can be enriched 
with multimodalities by introducing locally integrated sensors and

stimuli-responsive materials acting as novel artificial nociceptors 
(thermoelectric modules), haptics (pressure sensors) and artificial 
retina systems (optical or light sensors). In robotics, on-chip biochemi-
cal learning schemes with real neurotransmitters could also be interest-
ing to investigate and might open up entirely new dimensions beyond 
conventional approaches of digital-like reinforcement learning.
The ability of organic (neuromorphic) devices to be distributed in 
large areas can enable forms of environmental intelligence. For exam-
ple, low-cost biosensors (which are printable or biodegradable) that 
monitor plant nutritional levels and extract specific spatiotemporal 
patterns across the field and within day–night or seasonal cycles could 
be critical for improving decision-making in precision agriculture126,127. 
Environmental intelligence may also benefit from organic neuromor-
phic electronics that act as a substrate for large-scale and distributed 
sensing, processing and pattern recognition128. In this way, large objects 
such as buildings could be regarded as perceiving, acting and adapting 
structures, with multimodal organic neuromorphic electronics that 
measure in real-time and extract optical, mechanical or acoustic pat-
terns. Such large-scale intelligence might provide valuable information 
and real-time control regarding the optimum energy consumption, 
mechanical integrity or environmental noise.
Biohybrid systems and neuromorphic bioelectronics. Organic 
neuro­morphic devices and their corresponding arrays and circuits 
have a great potential to operate at the interface with biology and in 
particular with neuron(-like) cells (Fig. 4). These biohybrid neuromor-
phic platforms could encode cellular signals and process biological 
information exploiting electrical and electrochemical transduction 
processes. In fact, because organic biosensing interfaces have high 
selectivity and sensitivity, biohybrid synapses have been established 
with a single neurotransmitter29. Electrochemical and collective modu-
lation of multiple neurotransmitters has also been exploited to create 
biohybrid optoelectronic synapses30.
Triggered by biological signalling, hybrid platforms can also 
provide functional actuation and control over synaptic molecules99, 
biological membranes129, cell layers21, tissue and organ130 or eventually 
living organisms20,131–133. Ideally, these systems can act as a bridge and 
establish bidirectional interactions between the living and artificial

Perspective
world to monitor biological functions and actuate a mean of stimula-
tion if required by means of a closed-loop system134. In turn, seam-
less integration and transparent, soft and conformable interfaces 
between the artificial neurons and the host biological system will pro-
vide mechanical stability over the long term. In order to achieve good 
interfacing, flexible and stretchable materials represent an excellent 
choice both for the device support and electroactive materials135–138. 
In this scenario, blending organic semiconductors with tissue-like 
materials, such as gelatine-based materials, can massively lower the 
Young’s modulus mismatch between the device and the target tis-
sue. Neuromorphic is not only recalling electronic-based operation 
but should also be seen as a more general concept to recapitulate 
neuronal-inspired structural and functional factors18. In fact, the con-
tact area between the electroactive surface and the cellular environ-
ment should be attractive to cells and tissues and recognized as their 
own matrix. To this end, microstructuring and nanostructuring the 
electroactive surface with biomimetic designs and tailoring the surface 
chemistry can trigger tighter engagement (that is, mechanical match-
ing and more efficient signal transduction) of cells or tissue with the 
devices47,139. Furthermore, biohybrid neuromorphic systems might 
also support in situ multimodal sensing and computing through the 
combination of optoelectronics, electrochemistry, electrophysiology 
and iontronics and might provide real-time monitoring and computing 
of biosignals from the human body100,140.
However, closed-loop bidirectional communication that resem-
bles the learning and connectivity properties of the human brain 
is still lacking and requires computing capabilities that are still not 
fully achieved by organic interfaces. Such capabilities include the 
post-acquisition treatment of biosignals with operations such as spike 
sorting and brain wave classification140. Here, a visionary design would 
be the integration of inorganic high-throughput devices and memris-
tors (for information processing and biosignal treatment) with organic 
neuromorphics (to be the functional ionic–electronic transducing ele-
ments at the biological end)134,141. A potential application of such design 
would be to support the operation and maintenance of prosthetics to 
restore and potentiate, if needed, certain biological functions when 
key organ functionalities are lost.
Concluding remarks
Since 2015, the field of organic bioinspired electronics with OMIECs 
has been steadily growing with many important small steps. However, 
there are still some questions about what the future would look like. 
By introducing new materials, energy-efficient devices and uncon-
ventional functionalities, organic bioinspired electronics hold the 
synthetic toolkit for transformational changes in bioinspired and neu-
romorphic technologies. Diverse top–down and bottom–up fabrica-
tion and synthetic processes for point-like devices, device arrays or 
even distributed networks already exist. Owing to the inherent sensing 
and actuating capabilities and biocompatibility of organic electro-
chemical materials and devices, energy-efficient and multimodal edge 
computing and processing locally at the place of interest are only a 
few steps away. However, materials and device development is mostly 
laboratory-based and still at a premature stage, and thus requires 
leaps to reach a high level of technological readiness. Nevertheless, 
the path towards technological maturity is not completely unknown, 
as a trajectory has been already shaped by the development and com-
mercialization of organic LEDs and is out there as blueprint. Ad hoc 
characterization, analysis and modelling techniques, able to identify 
and describe the various sources of device degradation and variability, 
are still underdeveloped but necessary. New strategies for materials 
exploration and synthesis (manual or traditional, semi-automatic, or 
artificial intelligence-guided or autonomous) could be necessary for 
overcoming fundamental issues such as material degradation and 
for improving device metrics (retention time, speed, linearity in artifi-
cial synapses, spiking frequency in artificial neurons and so on), as well 
as for introducing novel functionalities (for example, artificial recep-
tors). Biocompatibility assessment is essential for every additional step 
(that is, when introducing new OMIECs, dopants or additives). Essential 
tools for the future development of integrated organic neuromorphic 
electronics, such as physically based analytical models for accurate

Fig. 4 | Biohybrid devices and systems. a, An organic artificial synapse can 
process co-current electrical (action potentials) and biochemical signals 
(neurotransmitters). b, Biohybrid artificial nerve systems mimic neural signal 
transmission — the conversion of biochemical signals (neurotransmitters) into 
electrical signals by the brain — which are transmitted by the artificial nerve to 
drive prosthetics. Multimodal (electrical and biochemical) neural networks 
allow and mediate the conversion, recognition and transmission process.

Perspective
computer-aided design circuit simulations, are still missing. Although 
not trivial for electronics, the biological wetware and its role in neural 
processing should be considered in circuit modelling and implementa-
tion. In a similar direction, hardware–algorithm co-design will most 
probably be necessary for the development of artificial networks, and 
to account for the special properties of such a technology (that is, need 
for access devices, linearity in programming, electrolyte operation and 
biosensing capabilities).
The community of organic bioinspired electronics still has a lot to 
learn from the progress of mature technologies such as complementary 
metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) and solid-state memristors. 
Indeed, CMOS-based neuromorphic electronics is a mature field that 
has accumulated decades of technological advancements. Therefore, 
lessons should be derived from CMOS technology on reliability, low 
device-to-device variability, upscaling and integration. Moreover, 
solid-state memristive technologies can be a source of inspiration for 
organic bioinspired electronics owing to their high level of integration, 
the advancements in hardware–algorithm co-design and the wide 
application space that has been demonstrated over the past decade. 
Co-integration of soft with solid-state technologies should also be 
considered in order to get the best out of every technology. However, it 
has to be clear that soft matter is not intending to replace conventional 
technologies, but rather to augment current capabilities, and for that, 
technological niches should be clearly identified.
A fundamental challenge, but with great innovation potential, is 
that biological phenomena are still in many cases not well understood 
and, therefore, their mapping into organic materials and/or device 
properties is ambiguous. Biorealism in neuromorphic electronics, 
for instance, is hard to be tabulated and described by engineering 
metrics. Therefore, it is still debatable up to which level the compu-
tational primitives of biological systems are critical for technological 
emulation. At least with this approach of biorealistic development, 
the integration borderline between the neuromorphic and the neural 
world will gradually fade away. This deeper symbiotic co-operation of 
biomimetic and neuromorphic technologies with the human activity 
could unravel new and unpredictable interaction dimensions and will 
substantially assist humans in various ways in the domains of personal  
and scientific computing, environmental intelligence, personalized and  
precision medicine, bioelectronics, point-of-care diagnostics, virtual 
or mixed reality, and (bio, soft)robotics. In a broader perspective, for 
instance, such interaction dimensions will open entirely new avenues 
for the development of strategies for understanding and controlling 
biology, with many unknown future ramifications. It seems that we 
are entering a new exploration phase in the domains of biocomput-
ing, neuromodulation, tissue engineering and regeneration, in which 
novel tools for interacting in a more natural manner with biological 
systems are necessary. In the future, it is speculated that biohybrid 
(artificial–neural) systems might work on our side synergistically and 
accompany us in such a way as animal domestication happened over 
the past few millennia. These far-reaching perspectives may mark the  
beginning of ethical considerations142. For instance, although a 
long-term goal of intelligent systems is their autonomous operation, 
either in in vitro or in vivo scenarios, a solid framework for safe opera-
tion is required. The framework for restoring pathological conditions 
with such novel technologies can be clearly defined. However, the 
ethical borderline is blurred when it comes to the augmentation of 
sensorimotor processes or physical capabilities, as such technologies 
might be more accessible to specific socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Because such technologies will create new and multimodal data, 
as well as new ways to control living organisms, an issue that rises is 
who has access to those (re)sources and how cognitive liberty and 
privacy are protected. Finally, how intellectual property can be man-
aged in human-made biohybrid systems that perform biocomputing 
is still an uncharted territory.
