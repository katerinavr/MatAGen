Organic electrochemical neuromorphic devices can be volatile (such as an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)) or non-volatile (such as an organic electrochemical resistive access memory (OEC-RAM)). b, OECT. The presence of ions in OMIECs (from an electrolyte) modulates the hole density of the polymer. At the device level, this ionic–electronic coupling is translated into a change of the drain current versus gate voltage (ID, versus VG) or a change of the transconductance versus gate voltage (gm versus VG) curve. The ion injection (application of VG) and ion back flow (removal of VG) are fully reversible and the device is volatile (indicated by the long dashed line with arrowsheads in panel a). c, OEC-RAM. The output characteristic of the device, can be tuned in an analogue fashion under the influence of input voltage pulses VP. OEC-RAMs are non-volatile and state retention is ensured with an access device (switch, transistor and so on) between the gate and the channel, imposing an open circuit potential or an energy barrier that prevents ion back flow (indicated by the short dashed line with arrowhead in panel a). d, Organic artificial neurons. Biological neurons in wetware: action potentials are generated and propagate across the axon. Biological neurons are immersed in an aqueous electrolyte, which is an environment that contains various carriers for signalling. Ion channels endow neurons with ionic and molecular specificity. Circuit blocks for organic electrochemical neurons: circuit blocks or devices correspond to different nonlinear behaviour (inverter topology: S-like response; cascade-like topology with feedback: S-shaped negative differential resistance (S-NDR); antiambipolar OMIECs (Gauss-like)). Colour-coded transistors correspond to different types of OMIECs (p-type and n-type, enhancement mode and depletion mode, and so on). Biorealistic artificial dynamics and bio-interfacing: organic artificial neurons based on mixed conductors display biorealistic dynamics that closely resembles those of biological neurons. Such neurons can be used as event-based components for neuromorphic bio-sensing, actuation and bio-interfacing. Parts a and b adapted from ref. 34, Springer Nature Limited.
