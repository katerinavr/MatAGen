ABSTRACT: Developing soft materials with both ion and
electron transport functionalities is of broad interest for
energy-storage and bioelectronics applications. Rational
design of these materials requires a fundamental under-
standing of interactions between ion and electron
conducting blocks along with the correlation between the
microstructure and the conduction characteristics. Here,
we investigate the structure and mixed ionic/electronic
conduction in thin ﬁlms of a liquid crystal (LC) 4T/PEO4,
which consists of an electronically conducting quarter-
thiophene (4T) block terminated at both ends by ionically
conducting oligoethylenoxide (PEO4) blocks. Using a combined experimental and simulation approach, 4T/PEO4 is
shown to self-assemble into smectic, ordered, or disordered phases upon blending the materials with the ionic dopant
bis(triﬂuoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) under diﬀerent LiTFSI concentrations. Interestingly, at intermediate
LiTFSI concentration, ordered 4T/PEO4 exhibits an electronic conductivity as high as 3.1 × 10−3 S/cm upon being
inﬁltrated with vapor of the 2,3,5,6-tetraﬂuoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) molecular dopant while still
maintaining its ionic conducting functionality. This electronic conductivity is superior by an order of magnitude to the
previously reported electronic conductivity of vapor co-deposited 4T/F4TCNQ blends. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that
structure and electronic transport in mixed conduction materials could be modulated by the presence of the ion
transporting component and will have important implications for other more complex mixed ionic/electronic conductors.

he molecular design of materials with the ability to

carriers is of broad interest spanning energy storage

conduction properties as well as the methods outlined for
measuring dual conduction have been extensively investigated
in various inorganic materials.6 More recently, the ﬁeld of
organic electronics which utilizes π-conjugated small molecules
and polymers as electronic conductors has experienced

facile chemical design.7−11 Together with the expansion of the
organic electronics ﬁeld, there have been growing interests in
developing organic materials such as polymeric12−19 or liquid
crystal (LC) systems20,21 with mixed electronic/ionic con-
ducting properties that couple the electronic conduction of the
π-conjugated moieties with other ionic conduction moieties.
Given their enormous potential, understanding the struc-
ture−processing−transport relationships in organic mixed
conductors are of keen scientiﬁc and technological interests.
Until now, only a few structure−mixed conduction studies
have been performed on organic mixed conductors, and most
of them only focus on polymeric systems.12−19 Understanding
fundamental mixed conduction in conjugated polymers,
however, is not straightforward due to the complex semi-
crystalline structures that make both structure characterization
and simulation challenging.19 Compared to polymeric systems,
LCs hold advantages of simple assembly and structural
reorganization because of their intrinsic ﬂuidity. The
nanostructure of LCs such as nematic, smectic, columnar, or
bicontinuous cubic can be achieved spontaneously via
nanoscale segregation of immiscible parts of the mole-
cules.22−25 Their small size also makes detailed simulations
of their structure and properties less computationally intensive
than simulation of polymeric systems. Moreover, their
synthesis is more precise, which makes them ideal material
testbeds for new chemical strategies without the major eﬀort
that developing new monomers would entail. While either
ionic or electronic transport behaviors in LCs have been widely
observed,26−30 so far, there have been only a few reports on
mixed ion/electron conduction behavior of LCs. Kato et al.
reported electrochromic behaviors of LCs as a result of the
materials’ ability to conduct ions and electrons, but no detailed
investigation of structure and ionic/electronic conduction
behaviors was shown.20,21
Toward studying mixed conduction in LCs, recently, we
synthesized a coil−rod−coil π-conjugated LC compound 4T/
PEO4 consisting of a quarterthiophene (4T) rigid mesogen
and ﬂexible tetra(ethylene oxide) (PEO4) segments on both
ends of the mesogen (Figure 1a).31 The π-conjugated 4T
mesogen serves as the electronically conducting unit, and the
PEO4 segments provide ion conducting properties when
blended with salt. The volume ratio of thiophene and the PEO
block is chosen in order to enable an ion transport function of
PEO4 while permitting π−π interaction between 4T units to
achieve smectic ordering. As seen in the polarized optical
image (POM) of neat 4T/PEO4 (Figure 1b), the material
exhibits birefringent characteristics typically observed in LC
materials. We have shown that 4T/PEO4 self-assembles to
form a highly ordered smectic phase, resulting in high ionic
conductivity of 5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 70 °C upon blending with
lithium bis(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at a
concentration of r = [Li+]/[EO] up to 0.05. Additionally,
the observation of π−π interaction between 4T units makes
4T/PEO4 a promising candidate to achieve the desired mixed
ionic and electronic conduction.
In this work, we combine experimental and computational
approaches to investigate the inﬂuence of the underlying 4T/
PEO4 self-assembled structure on its mixed conduction
characteristics. We show that blending 4T/PEO4 with LiTFSI
is a versatile route in generating LCs with diﬀerent structures,
which aﬀects both ionic and electronic conduction. At a
LiTFSI concentration r of 0.05 and below, 4T/PEO4 adopts
ordered smectic morphology, whereas at the intermediate
concentration r = 0.10, the 4T units start to penetrate into the
PEO phase and connect the smectic layer together, resulting in
a more ordered structure. At a high LiTFSI concentration of r
= 0.20, the 2D arrangement starts to break apart and the
system becomes disordered. While 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI samples
exhibit ionic conducting behavior, their electronic transport is
realized by exposing the samples to vapor of the 2,3,5,6-
tetraﬂuoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ),
which is a method known to introduce electronic dopants
into organic semiconductors without disrupting the morphol-
ogy of the host material.32 The optimum ion transport is
observed at low LiTFSI concentration, where 4T/PEO4
adopts smectic morphology, and the highest electronic
conductivity is seen at r = 0.10, where favorable electronic
percolation pathways exist. Our results demonstrate the strong
connection between processing, morphology, and mixed
conduction properties of LCs.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structure Control of 4T/PEO4 by the Addition of
LiTFSI. To study the evolution of 4T/PEO4 morphology upon
addition of the ionic dopant LiTFSI (chemical structure shown
in Figure 1a), we employ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray
scattering (GIWAXS), UV−vis−NIR absorption spectroscopy,
and variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), in
combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
The representative GIWAXS detector images of ca. 80 nm 4T/
PEO4-LiTFSI thin ﬁlm at diﬀerent r are shown in Figure 2a.
The GIWAXS pattern of the r = 0 sample shows narrow
diﬀraction peaks (00h) in the out-of-plane direction up to the
fourth order, indicative of an ordered smectic phase in which
the layers are oriented parallel to the substrate. This is further
supported by our MD results showing that the top view of 4T

units self-assemble into a typical herringbone packing
comparable to that in the P21/c crystal structure reported
for pure 4T.33 In our previous publication, we showed that the
herringbone packing of 4T drives the self-assembly of the 4T/
PEO4 smectic structure and results in the two distinctive π−π
interaction reﬂections marked A and B in our experimental and
simulated GIWAXS diﬀraction patterns.31 The elongation of
these reﬂections suggests strong in-plane and weak out-of-
plane ordering of the π−π interacting units. This is likely due
to the 2D π−π interaction of the 4T units within each smectic
plane. For r ≤0.05, the diﬀraction patterns of 4T/PEO4-
LiTFSI are qualitatively similar to those of the neat samples,
indicating that the smectic morphology of 4T/PEO4 is
maintained. This is conﬁrmed by the MD simulation snapshot
and calculated GIWAXS patterns of r = 0.05, as shown in
Figure 2b,c.
For r = 0.1, we observe a signiﬁcant change in the structure
of the sample compared to the neat and lower salt
concentration samples. The GIWAXS image of the r = 0.1
sample reveals a diﬀerent diﬀraction pattern indicative of a
more ordered 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI structure. The appearance of
extra diﬀraction peaks in this sample might indicate either a
more periodic arrangement between 4T and PEO domains
and/or an increase in crystallinity upon interacting with
LiTFSI. Moreover, we do not observe the peak elongation of
the oﬀ-axis reﬂections along the vertical direction, as seen in
the r = 0 or 0.05 samples, suggesting a better 3D registration
between 4T units along the π−π interaction direction across
the whole ﬁlm thickness. In the MD-generated structure at r =
0.1, we observe 4T/PEO4 fragments acquiring enough
translational entropy to break apart from the herringbone
arrangement of 4T, penetrate the PEO phase, and thus connect
the smectic layers. To quantify the smectic order disruption
from MD simulation, we performed a cluster analysis using
hierarchical clustering for thiophene rings. Two thiophene
rings are considered part for the same cluster if they are 0.6 nm
or less apart. We merge all the clusters given the same criteria
until we are left with smallest number of clusters, Nc, which are
at least 0.6 nm apart. We found that Nc = 2 for r = 0.01, 0.02,
and 0.05, and Nc = 1 for r = 0.10 and 0.2, indicative of a layer
merging at high LiTFSI concentrations. As demonstrated in
Figure 2c, the calculated GIWAXS pattern of the r = 0.1
sample shows key similarities to the experimental GIWAXS
patterns with the appearance of diﬀraction reﬂections near |qr|
= 0.6, 0.9, 1.3, 1.5, and 2 Å−1. The appearance of these
diﬀraction reﬂections in the r = 0.1 sample thus most likely

originated from the additional periodicities between 4T and
PEO domains introduced by the interlayer bridge rather than
the increase in the crystallinity of the samples. Finally, at very
high salt concentration of r = 0.2, the smectic peaks in the out-
of-plane direction signiﬁcantly broaden and the signature π−π
interacting peaks at higher q disappears, indicating that the LC
structure of 4T/PEO4 is lost by the excess amount of LiTFSI,
which is observed in the corresponding MD simulation
snapshots and the calculated GIWAXS patterns.
To corroborate the structure insights acquired from
GIWAXS and MD simulations, we perform UV−vis−NIR
absorption spectroscopy and VASE experiments. We partic-
ularly focus on the r = 0.1 sample where the most dramatic
4T/PEO4 structural change occurs. As seen in Figure 3a, for
both r = 0 and r = 0.1 samples, we observe the appearance of
the vibronic (or “aggregate”) shoulders as indicated by the
arrows. These vibronic shoulders suggest the formation of π−π
aggregates within the thin ﬁlm sample. Interestingly, in the r =
0.1 sample, the intensity of these aggregate shoulders greatly
enhances, suggesting better π−π interaction of 4T/PEO4 upon
the addition of LiTFSI. VASE measurement was performed to
further determine the average orientation of the conjugated
backbone 4T with regard to the underlying substrates. For
both r = 0 and r = 0.1 samples, the best ﬁts were achieved by
employing the uniaxial anisotropic model which assumes
diﬀerent dielectric functions for the in- and out-of-plane
direction, but no preferred orientation within the x−y plane
(ε″x = ε″y ≠ε″z).34 The imaginary part of the complex
permittivity ε″ of the r = 0 and r = 0.1 samples is shown in
Figure 3b,c. The r = 0 sample exhibits pronounced anisotropic
behavior which has an out-of-plane imaginary permittivity that
is stronger than that of the in-plane component. This is
indicative of the average tendency of the conjugated backbone
4T to lie perpendicular to the substrate, which is consistent
with the observation from GIWAXS data. The preferred out-
of-plane orientation of the conjugated backbone of 4T/PEO4
is probably due to the favorable interaction of the PEO side
chain with the SiO2 substrate. On the other hand, the in-plane
and out-of-plane imaginary permittivities of the r = 0.1 sample
are more comparable, suggesting that, unlike the neat sample,

quarterthiophene units in this sample are no longer preferably
oriented in the out-of-plane direction. It is likely the smectic
phases destabilize at r= 0.1, and thus creates a mesophase with
stronger π−π interaction and percolation between 4T units as
indicated by GIWAXS and MD simulations above. Overall, we
have shown that blending 4T/PEO4 with LiTFSI is an
eﬀective method to control its structure, which will directly
inﬂuence ionic and electronic transport properties as described
in the next sections.
Introducing Electronic Conduction Functionality via
F4TCNQ Vapor Doping. 4T is formally a semiconducting
material and insulating in its pristine state. To enable and
modulate electronic conduction in 4T/PEO4 and 4T/PEO4-
LiTFSI requires the incorporation of molecular dopants.
Speciﬁcally, the small molecule electron acceptor F4TCNQ
has been shown to be a suitable dopant molecule for 4T.35
Note that diﬀerent strategies of solution mixing and sequential
doping have been employed to introduce molecular dopants
into conjugated organic semiconductors.32,36,37 Motivated to
understand how controlling the underlying self-assembled
structure with LiTFSI inﬂuences the charge transport proper-
ties, we choose to follow the sequential doping method where
one ﬁrst casts a thin ﬁlm and then inﬁltrates F4TCNQ from
the vapor phase using diﬀerent exposure times, as illustrated in
Figure 4a. Critically, previous reports have shown that vapor
doping of polymeric semiconductors with F4TCNQ leads to
homogeneous doping through the thickness of the thin ﬁlm
and with minimal disruption of the underlying self-assembled
structure.32,37,38 For our 4T/PEO4 r = 0 and r = 0.1 thin ﬁlms,
GIWAXS experiments reveal that vapor doping does not lead
to signiﬁcant disruption to the underlying self-assembled
structure as indicated by similar GIWAXS patterns before and
after vapor doping with F4TCNQ (see Supporting Informa-
tion Figure S4).
To reveal the extent of molecular doping as a function of
F4TCNQ vapor exposure time, we performed UV−vis−NIR
absorption measurements as shown for 4T/PEO4 r = 0 and r =
0.1 thin ﬁlms in Figure 4b,c. Overall, the evolution of the UV−
vis−NIR spectra is consistent with formation of hole charge
carriers from the molecular doping process. For both thin
ﬁlms, vapor doping leads to a decrease in the primary
absorption peaks between 2.5 eV and 3.5 eV and the
appearance of subgap absorption peaks in the 0.5−1 eV
range, whose intensity increases with doping time. The
saturation doping exposure time is around 25 min for both r
= 0 and r = 0.1 samples for the experimental conditions of this
work. Additionally, for both samples, the intensity of the two
subgap peaks is relatively strong compared to the main
absorption peaks, suggesting that F4TCNQ is homogeneously
distributed through the thickness of the ﬁlm beyond 25 min of
deposition. This conclusion is further supported by GIWAXS
depth proﬁle measurements in Figure S7, where nearly
homogeneous diﬀraction proﬁles are observed at diﬀerent
depths of the sample doped with F4TCNQ vapor for 25 min.
With respect to the doping mechanism, the appearance of
the characteristic subgap peaks between 0.5 eV and 1.0 eV in
UV−vis−NIR spectra is indicative of the ground-state charge
transfer complex (CPX) doping mechanism, which has been
similarly observed in 4T vapor co-deposited with F4TCNQ.35
CPX is described to occur through frontier orbital hybrid-
ization of 4T and F4TCNQ, which leads to the formation of a
hole transporting 4T/PEO4-F4TCNQ mixed phase. The
formation of 4T/PEO4-F4TCNQ mixed phase is further
supported by the small increase in 4T/PEO4 π−π interaction
distance from 0.47 nm to 0.52 nm upon introducing F4TCNQ
for the r = 0 sample (Figure S6). Interestingly, for the r = 0
sample, we observe absportion peaks from F4TCNQ anions
near 1.5 eV for short vapor exposure times. The appearance of
a F4TCNQ anion absorption peak is indicative of the integer

charge transfer (ICT) doping mechanism where electron
transfers occur from the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) of the host organic semiconductor to the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the acceptor
dopant. A similar coexistence of CPX and ICT observed in
our 4T/PEO4 r = 0 sample was recently shown in P3HT
doped with F4TCNQ.39
Mixed Ion/Electron Conduction in 4T/PEO4 Meas-
ured by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. To
determine the inﬂuence of F4TCNQ molecular doping on the
charge transport properties of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI thin ﬁlms, we
performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
measurement at room temperature. All of our electronic and
ionic conductivity measurements were performed on samples
fabricated atop gold interdigitated electrode (IDE) devices
(Figure 5a) to increase the eﬀective surface areas and enhance
the signal-to-noise ratio of electrical measurements in thin
ﬁlms.40 We note that, at room temperature, the intrinsic
electronic conductivity of 4T/PEO4 without F4TCNQ was
(4.9 ± 1.5) × 10−7 S/cm, as determined by the DC method.
The intrinsic electronic conductivity without F4TCNQ of 4T/
PEO4-LiTFSI samples was below 2 × 10−8 S/cm for all values
of r. These values of intrinsic electronic conductivity are
suﬃciently low to enable the measurement of ionic
conductivity using the EIS method.13
Figure 5b depicts Nyquist impedance plots of the r = 0.1
sample at diﬀerent F4TCNQ doping times. As frequently
observed for ion conducting materials, the Nyquist plot of the
sample without F4TCNQ shows a semicircle at high
frequencies and a capacitive tail at low frequencies, indicative
of dominating ion conducting behavior. Upon introducing
vapor F4TCNQ to the sample for 3 min, the Nyquist
impedance data drastically change. The observation of two
semicircles in the Nyquist plot together with the absence of the
capacitive tail at low frequency indicates the presence of both
ionic and electronic transport.13 At 30 min of F4TCNQ

doping, the Nyquist impedance data become a single
semicircle with a signiﬁcantly reduced radius, indicating that
the electronic conductivity has increased considerably
compared to ionic conductivity. The ionic and electronic
resistance values were calculated for F4TCNQ-doped 4T/
PEO4-LiTFSI samples by ﬁtting the EIS data to the
appropriate equivalent circuits shown in the inset of each
Nyquist plot in Figure 5b. The rationale for the equivalent
circuit selection and conductivity calculation is reported
elsewhere13 and is also detailed in the Supporting Information.
We note for all samples that the electronic conductivity can be
measured using either the EIS or the DC method, both
yielding good agreement, suggesting the accuracy of the model
ﬁt in our EIS data.
Shown in Figure 5c is the room temperature electronic
conductivity of the two samples as a function of F4TCNQ
doping time. As expected, vapor doping F4TCNQ leads to an
increase in lateral thin ﬁlm electronic conductivity for both
samples. The neat r = 0 sample shows more than an order of
magnitude increase in electronic conductivity from (1.3 ±
0.89) × 10−5 S/cm to (3.2 ± 0.54) × 10−4 S/cm after 25 min
of doping. The r = 0.1 sample initially has a conductivity lower
than that of the 4T/PEO4 neat sample but exhibits a larger
increase in conductivity from (1.3 ± 0.16) × 10−7 S/cm to (3.1
± 0.45) × 10−3 S/cm after 25 min of doping. We believe the
higher electronic conductivity of the r = 0 sample at lower
vapor doping times relates to the presence of ICT states in
coexistence with CPX states. It has been proposed that ICT
states lead to more mobile charge carriers relative to CPX.41 In
turn, the formation of either CPX or ICT states is intimately
linked to the nature of mobile charge carriers, indicating the
magnitude of electronic conductivity.
Interestingly, near the optimal doping time, the maximum
electronic conductivity of (3.1 ± 0.45) × 10−3 S/cm in the r =
0.1 sample is nearly an order of magnitude higher than the
maximum electronic conductivity of the r = 0 sample.
Moreover, electronic conductivity of the r = 0.1 sample is
superior to the maximum conductivity of 4T co-deposited with
F4TCNQ reported by Méndez and Heimel et al.35 as marked
by the dashed line in Figure 5c. Considering that both samples
yield only CPX states at the optimal doping time and a
comparable doping level, the improvement in electronic
conductivity most likely arises from the diﬀerence in the
underlying self-assembled structure as suggested by the
structural changes observed in GIWAXS and MD simulation
results discussed earlier.
Figure 5d summarizes the evolution of ionic and electronic
conductivity of the r = 0.1 sample as a function of F4TCNQ
vapor doping time. The charge transport processes can be
divided into three stages: the early stage where ionic transport
dominates (gray-shaded area), the intermediate stage where
ionic and electronic transports are comparable (orange-shaded
area), and the late stage where the electronic transport
dominates (blue-shade area). Here, we would like to note that,
at the late stage, we believe that ionic conduction still remains.
However, the EIS response only captures the lower resistance
electronic transport contribution as we are using electronically
reversible and ion-blocking Au metal electrodes.13 Our results
indicate that 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI samples still maintain their ion
conducting functionality upon doping with F4TCNQ.
Inﬂuence of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI Morphology on Mixed
Conduction. It is evident that the underlying self-assembled
structure with the addition of LiTFSI plays a vital role in
dictating charge transport properties. Thus, we expand and
characterize the electronic and ionic conduction characteristics
of all LiTFSI concentrations from r = 0 to r = 0.20 after vapor
doping with F4TCNQ. As shown in Supporting Information
Figure S2, all samples show similar trends for both ionic and
electronic conductivity as a function of F4TCNQ doping time.
In Figure 6a, we summarize the ionic conductivity of 4T/
PEO4-LiTFSI samples before F4TCNQ inﬁltration as well as
the maximum electronic conductivity of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI
samples upon introducing F4TCNQ vapor. Similar to our
previous results,31 the room temperature ionic conductivity of
4T/PEO4-LiTFSI is relatively high for r = 0.01 [(2.3 ± 0.2) ×
10−5 S/cm)] and r = 0.05 [(4.2 ± 0.3) × 10−5 S/cm] samples
due to the ordered smectic morphology of 4T/PEO4. The
stable smectic morphology and high ionic conductivity up to r
= 0.05 in 4T/PEO4 are similar to those in other reports by
Ohtake et al., where the authors found that lithium salt-
complexed rod−coil−rod LCs exhibited a stabilized meso-
phase with high ionic conductivity.42,43 However, at r = 0.10
and r = 0.20, where the smectic layer ordering is disrupted, we
found a signiﬁcant decrease in ionic conductivity for both
concentrations. Although the decrease in ionic conductivity at
high concentrations could originate from ion-pair formation
and the reduction in segmental mobility that arises from
transient cross-linking between Li+ and EO units,44 we partially
attribute the decrease in ionic conductivity to the disruption of
the smectic ordering that hinders the ionic conduction
pathways within the samples. On the other hand, the electronic
conductivity remains relatively constant for r ≤0.05, where
4T/PEO4 adopts a smectic morphology but increases by an
order of magnitude at r = 0.1, as was shown earlier. At r = 0.2,
the electronic conductivity signiﬁcantly decreases, which is also
consistent with the poorly ordered structure suggested by both
GIWAXS and MD simulations.
To provide further insights into the origin of the maximum
electronic conductivity at r = 0.1, we calculate the electronic
mobility
eμ for the MD structures of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI

method to ﬁnd the fraction of open connections in each MD-
generated structure. Additional details of electron mobility
estimation are shown in the Supporting Information. Note that
the reorganization energy in Marcus theory has both inner and
outer contributions, with the former coming from the nuclear
reorganization of the reactants and products and the latter
from the reorganization of the environment around the
reactants and products.47 However, as we are primarily
interested in capturing the qualitative eﬀect of varying LiTFSI

concentration, we only calculate the inner contribution and
assume that the outer contribution, although signiﬁcant in
absolute value, is relatively constant (i.e., less sensitive to salt
concentration). As shown in Figure 6b, the predicted
percolation factor θp and electron mobility μed follow similar
quantitative trends as a function of LiTFSI concentration r.
Both θp and μe are relatively constant from r = 0 to r = 0.05,
where 4T/PEO4 adopts a smectic morphology. However, both
θp and μe increase and reach a maximum at r = 0.1. These
simulation results reveal that the change in the self-assembled
structure, indicative of 3D interconnectivity between smectic
layers, accounts for the enhanced electronic conductivity at r =
0.1. As the structure of 4T/PEO4 becomes disordered at r =
0.2, both θp and μe decrease signiﬁcantly, which is consistent
with the poor electronic conductivity measured experimentally.
To further emphasize the role of electronic charge
percolation on electronic conductivity, we perform electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurements on
r = 0 and r = 0.1 samples as a function of F4TCNQ vapor
doping time, the results of which are shown in Figure 6c,d.
Before doping, no EPR signals are observed, which is indicative
of negligible intrinsic charge carriers in 4T/PEO4. Upon
introducing F4TCNQ, the EPR signal increases as a function
of doping time and saturates around 25 min for both samples,
which is consistent with UV−vis−NIR results. This evolution
is indicative of increase in spin concentration arising from the
electronic charge carriers formed from molecular doping.
Importantly, for the same F4TCNQ doping time, the EPR
signal of the r = 0.1 sample is much sharper compared to that
of the r = 0 sample. For EPR measurement of organic
semiconductors, the narrowing of EPR signals typically
originates from delocalization of spin (shallow trapped electron
spins). This is due to the averaging of the anisotropic part of
magnetic interactions and/or decrease of hyperﬁne interaction.
The increased delocalization of electronic charge could be due
either to (i) increasing crystallinity and/or (ii) increasing
percolation of charge transporting pathways. Based on our
observation from MD simulation in Figure 2, we postulate that
the bridging of the smectic layers enhances the percolation
pathways for charge carrier, which gives rise to the sharpening
of the EPR signal in r = 0.1 samples. We emphasize that the
ﬁnal spin concentration at the optimal doping time is
determined to be around 1020 cm−3 for both r = 0 and r =
0.1 samples (see Supporting Information Figure S3 for more
details). As conductivity is the product of charge carrier
mobility and carrier concentration, the similar carrier
concentration suggests that the improvement in electronic
conductivity of the r = 0.1 sample originates from a higher
“apparent” electronic carrier mobility (assuming all carriers
possess equal mobility). The change in carrier mobility is
supported by the MD snapshots of structure and electron
transfer rate ki for r = 0 and r = 0.1 samples, which indicates
better percolation pathways for electronic carrier transport in
the r = 0.1 sample (Figure 6e,f). Our combined experimental
and computational results thus provide complementary pieces
of the connection between processing, morphology, and ion/
electron transport behaviors in LC systems.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we have investigated the ionic and electronic
conduction characteristics in connection to the self-assembled
structure of a π-conjugated oligothiophene-based liquid crystal
4T/PEO4 upon doping with the LiTFSI salt and the F4TCNQ
molecular dopant. Using GIWAXS, spectroscopic ellipsometry
measurement in combination with molecular dynamics
simulation, we showed that 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI samples under-
went a transition from a smectic morphology at LiTFSI
concentration of r = 0.05 to a more ordered structure with
better percolation between 4T units at r = 0.1 before losing its
ordered structure at r = 0.20. The highest ionic conductivity
was observed for r = 0.05 and below whereas the ionic
conductivity decreased at r = 0.10 and 0.20 partially due to the
disruption of ion conduction pathways. The electronic
conductivity upon doping with vapor F4TCNQ was shown
to increase from r = 0 to r = 0.10 due to the improvement of
percolation pathways for electronic transports, whereas the r =
0.20 sample exhibited the lowest electronic conductivity
because of the disordered structure. UV−vis−NIR absorption
spectroscopy measurement indicated that CPX was the major
F4TCNQ doping mechanism for both r = 0 and r = 0.1
samples, suggesting the formation of a cocrystal between
F4TCNQ and 4T/PEO4. Importantly, for the r = 0 sample, in
addition to the expected CPX process, we also observe the
weak ICT process at the early state of F4TCNQ doping,
indicating the presence of both electronic doping mechanisms
in one single material.
The results presented in this work provide several important
contributions to the rational design of electronic and ionic
transporting LC materials. First, we introduce the design
strategy of using LC multiblock oligomers that provide both
electroactive and ion-active properties. Second, we describe a
detailed connection between processing, self-assembly, and
ion/electron transport behavior in LC systems. In addition, we
show how the use of LC materials introduces opportunities in
elucidating molecular doping mechanisms, which could
signiﬁcantly help in advancing the ﬁeld of organic semi-
conductors. Our results thus enable additional, more detailed
studies of the interconnection among LC self-assembly,
electronic properties of 4T/PEO4 (and related molecules),
and molecular doping; work along these lines is currently
under way. By utilizing the ease of synthesis, straightforward
self-assembly, and less intensive computational calculation, we
showed that LCs could be use as material testbeds to
understand mixed conduction behavior of soft materials in
general.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Materials and Sample Preparation. The synthesis of 4T/PEO4
was accomplished via two-fold Kumada cross-coupling of 5,5′-
dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene with 3 equiv of the corresponding
brominated thiophene-PEO4 precursors in the presence of Ni(dppp)-
Cl2 as catalyst. More details of the synthesis procedure are provided in
our previous publication.31
All substrates used in this study were cleaned by ultrasonication in
acetone and 2-propanol for 15 min each followed by ozone plasma
treatment for 5 min. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
measurements were performed on ﬁlms deposited on Si substrates
with 1.5 nm of native SiO2. UV−vis−NIR absorption measurement
was performed on ﬁlms deposited on top of glass substrates.
Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were performed on ﬁlms
supported by Si substrates possessing diﬀerent thermal oxide layer
thicknesses. Conductivity measurements were performed on ﬁlms
deposited atop custom-fabricated interdigitated gold electrodes on Si
substrates with 1000 nm of thermally grown SiO2. Electro-
paramagnetic resonance measurement was performed on ﬁlms
supported by quartz substrates.
Solutions of 4T/PEO4 and lithium bis(triﬂuoromethane)-
sulfonimide (LiTFSI) salt (Sigma-Aldrich, battery grade) were

prepared separately by dissolving the materials in anhydrous
tetrahydrofuran (Sigma-Aldrich) with a concentration 10 mg/mL
each and shaken on a vortexer for at least several hours before mixing.
4T/PEO4 and LiTFSI solutions were then mixed at the appropriate
ratios to achieve the desired concentrations. The mixed solutions were
then shaken overnight before being spun onto the prepared substrates
at 1000 rpm for 2 min to make both pristine 4T/PEO4 and 4T/
PEO4-LiTFSI thin ﬁlms. Film thicknesses of all samples in this study
were kept at ca. 80 nm, as conﬁrmed by spectroscopic ellipsometry
measurement. All sample preparation was performed in an argon-ﬁlled
glovebox.
Vapor Doping Procedure of F4TCNQ. Vapor doping of
F4TCNQ was performed using the previously described procedure.32
In brief, 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI thin ﬁlms were vapor-doped with
F4TCNQ in an argon-ﬁlled glovebox. Approximately 5 mg of dopant
was placed in a glass jar (diameter ≈5 cm; height ≈4.5 cm), and then
the glass jar was inserted into a stainless-steel container preheated at
∼200 °C for at least 30 min on top of a hot plate. The sample was
placed underneath the cap using double-sided tape. The samples were
taken out of the doping chamber at diﬀerent times to achieve samples
at diﬀerent doping times (doping levels).
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Conductivity
measurements were performed on a sample fabricated on top of the
gold IDE using a Gamry 600+ potentiostat inside an oxygen- and
moisture-free argon-ﬁlled glovebox. An optical image of the IDE
device is exempliﬁed in Figure 5a. Prior to conductivity measurement,
the excess amount of materials on the electrode pads was removed.
The electrical connection from the IDE to the potentiostat was made
using two custom-built microprobes. The EIS characterization was
performed from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz with an oscillatory peak potential of
50 mV. The collected impedance data were then ﬁt to the appropriate
equivalent circuits in order to extract the sample ionic resistance, Rion,
and electronic resistance, Re. Details of selecting equivalent circuits
are shown in the Results and Discussion. The conductivity σ of the
sample was then calculated according to the following equation:48

Here, d = 8 μm is the separation distance between electrodes; l =
1000 μm is the electrode length; N = 160 is the number of electrodes,
and h = 80 nm is the thickness of the ﬁlm.
Grazing Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering. GIWAXS
measurements were performed at beamline 8-ID-E of the Advanced
Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, with 10.86 keV (λ =
0.11416 nm) synchrotron radiation. Samples were enclosed and
measured inside a low-vacuum chamber (10−3 mbar) to minimize
concerns about radiation damage as well as to prevent extraneous
scattering from ambient air. The measurement time was chosen to be
4 s per frame. For each sample, three data sets were taken from three
adjacent spots on the sample and then averaged in order to enhance
the signal-to-noise ratio. In our work, the samples were tilted at an
angle of incidence of 1° with respect to the incoming beam. This
angle was chosen to be above the estimated critical angle of the
sample (ca. 0.13°) but also above the critical angle of the Si substrates
(ca. 0.17°) in order to probe the whole ﬁlm thickness and minimize
signal from reﬂected beam at the same time.49,50 The scattering signal
was recorded with a Pilatus 1MF pixel array detector (pixel size = 172
μm) positioned 228 mm from the sample. Each data set was stored as
a 981 × 1043 32-bit tiﬀimage with a 20-bit dynamic range. The
Pilatus detector has rows of inactive pixels at the border between
detector modules. In order to ﬁll these gaps, after each measurement,
the detector was moved to a new vertical direction and the
measurement on each spot was repeated, then the gaps were ﬁlled
by combining the data from two detector positions. The signals were
reshaped and output as intensity maps in qz versus qr (=

space. We also performed detector nonuniformity, detection
eﬃciency, the polarization eﬀect, and a solid-angle variation for
each image. Vertical line cuts were performed as a function of
intensity along the qz direction. All of the GIWAXS data processing
and extraction were executed using the GIXSGUI package for
MATLAB.51
UV−Vis−NIR Absorption Spectroscopy. The UV−vis−NIR
absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed using a
Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus UV−vis−NIR dual beam spectrophotometer
at the Soft Matter Characterization Facility (SMCF) at the University
of Chicago.
Molecular Dynamics Simulation. We simulate all of the systems
using LAMMPS with optimized parameters for liquid simulations all-
atom as the force ﬁeld. The force ﬁeld parameters for 4T/PEO4 are
the same as the ones used in our previous works,31 and for LiTFSI, we
use the parameters used by Park et al.52 The initial structures are
prepared using the methodology shown in our previous work, where
200 units of PEO4 along with the varying concentrations of LiTFSI
are equilibrated as a bilayer system and then attached to the 4T crystal
to create a smectic structure with LiTFSI in the PEO regime. To
equilibrate the 4T/PEO4 systems containing LiTFSI, we thermal
cycled all of the systems between 300 and 380 K for 10 times at a rate
of 10 K/ns followed by 20 ns simulation at 300 K. Details of
electronic mobility calculation are shown in Supporting Information
Figure S7.

Variable-Angle Spectroscopic Ellipsometry. The optical
anisotropy of 4T/PEO4-LiTFSI samples was measured using the α-
SE variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (J.A. Woollam Co.).
Measurements were performed on three identical ﬁlms spun on Si
substrates; one possessed ca. 1.5 nm of native SiO2 thickness, and two
possessed a thermally grown oxide layer of thicknesses ca. 100 and
1000 nm. The thermally grown SiO2 layers were used for interference
enhancement to increase the out-of-plane signal. VASE measurements
were performed in the reﬂection mode at three angles: 65, 70, and
75°. A multisample analysis of three samples was used to increase the
goodness of the results because of the strong correlations between the
ﬁtting parameters.34 All of the data analyses were performed using the
CompleteEASE software, provided by J.A. Woollam Co. The optical
constants of Si, native oxide, and thermal oxide were also taken from
CompleteEASE software’s library database.
Polarized Optical Microscopy. An Olympus BX51 polarizing
optical microscope was used for visual observation of optical textures
of 4T/PEO4.
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Continu-
ous wave X-band (9−10 GHz) EPR experiments were carried out
with a Bruker ELEXSYS II E500 EPR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin,
Rheinstetten, Germany), equipped with a TE102 rectangular EPR
resonator (Bruker ER 4102ST). Measurements were performed at
room temperature (T = 295 K). Thin ﬁlms on the substrate with
dimensions of 2 mm × 15 mm were placed in the EPR quartz tubes
with 4 mm in diameter. For spin quantiﬁcation, a single crystal of
CuSO4·5H2O with known spin concentration was used as a reference
sample. Spin quantiﬁcation was done by comparing double integrals
of the experimental and reference EPR signals.
