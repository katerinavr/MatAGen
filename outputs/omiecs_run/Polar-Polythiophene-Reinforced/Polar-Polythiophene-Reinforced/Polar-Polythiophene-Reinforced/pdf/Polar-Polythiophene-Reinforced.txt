ABSTRACT: Conjugated polymers with oligoether side chains are promising mixed ionic-
electronic conductors, but they tend to feature a low glass transition temperature and hence a low
elastic modulus, which prevents their use if mechanical robust materials are required.
Carboxymethylated cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) are found to be a suitable reinforcing agent for
a soft polythiophene with tetraethylene glycol side chains. Dry nanocomposites feature a Young’s
modulus of more than 400 MPa, which reversibly decreases to 10 MPa or less upon passive swelling
through water uptake. The presence of CNF results in a slight decrease in electronic mobility but
enhances the ionic mobility and volumetric capacitance, with the latter increasing from 164 to 197
F cm−3 upon the addition of 20 vol % CNF. Overall, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)
feature a higher switching speed and a transconductance that is independent of the CNF content
up to at least 20 vol % CNF. Hence, CNF-reinforced conjugated polymers with oligoether side
chains facilitate the design of mechanically adaptive mixed ionic-electronic conductors for wearable
electronics and bioelectronics.

■INTRODUCTION
Conjugated polymers are widely studied for optoelectronic
applications ranging from organic photovoltaics and thermo-
electrics to bioelectronics.1−3 The type and number of side
chains strongly impact the solubility, solid-state order as well as
the ability to transport ions and electronic charge.4,5 Alkyl and
oligoether side chains are widely used, and both types facilitate
solubility of conjugated polymers in organic solvents, with the
latter ones enabling processing from solvents of higher
polarity.6 Conjugated polymers with oligoether side chains
can undergo significant passive swelling, i.e., the uptake of
water when submerged in an aqueous electrolyte, as well as
active swelling, i.e., the ingression of additional electrolyte
upon the application of an electrochemical potential.7,8
Conjugated polymer films display mixed ionic and electronic
conduction, i.e., the ability to transport both ions and
electronic charge carriers, which is of considerable interest
for bioelectronics and exploited in devices such as organic
electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and ion pumps.9−11
Oligoether side chains also endow conjugated polymers with
a sub-zero glass transition temperature Tg,12 in contrast to
polymers with alkyl side chains, which can feature a Tg
considerably above room temperature (Figure 1).13 It can be
anticipated that a sub-zero Tg will result in fast backbone as
well as side-chain relaxation kinetics at ambient conditions,
which benefits ion mobility. On the other hand, a low Tg also
tends to result in a soft material at room temperature,

especially if the crystallinity of the polymer is low. Accordingly,
conjugated polymers with oligoether side chains display a
much lower tensile elastic modulus at room temperature, e.g.,
E < 10 MPa in the case of p(g42T-T) with tetraethylene glycol
side chains,12 which is the subject of this study (see Figure 2a
for the chemical structure), and E < 50 MPa in the case of a
high-molecular-weight grade of a similar polythiophene with
shorter triethylene glycol side chains.14 In contrast, polymers
that bear alkyl side chains tend to feature values of E ≫100
MPa, especially when paired with an above room temperature
Tg (Figure 1). Water uptake by polymers with oligoether side
chains can be expected to lead to a further reduction in elastic
modulus. Such soft materials must be used with an adequate
support such as a (flexible) substrate to facilitate their use
where mechanical robustness is required, e.g., in the case of
implantable electrodes,15 conducting fibers for e-textile
devices16,17 such as fiber-based electrochemical transistors,18,19
or the legs of a thermoelectric generator.1 For some
applications, it would be desirable if the material or device
was initially rigid to facilitate, e.g., insertion as a free-standing
artifact into a biological tissue but then became soft once
installed or implanted.20,21
To modulate the mechanical properties of conjugated
polymers, strategies such as the introduction of flexible
spacers,30 copolymerization31,32 or blending with an insulating
polymer,33 compounding with nanocellulose,34 and molecular
doping12 have been explored. Nanocomposites are intriguing
because they may allow increasing the stiffness of the material
without unduly compromising ion mobility and chain
relaxation dynamics within the conjugated polymer matrix.
Nanocellulose continues to receive widespread attention as a
reinforcing agent for polymers due to its high strength,
stiffness, and aspect ratio.35,36 Nanocellulose has been used as
an additive for a number of different conjugated polymer-based
materials such as polypyrrole (PPy),37,38 polyaniline (PANI),34
and poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)34 as well as poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PE-
DOT:PSS).39−41 For example, the addition of cellulose
nanofibrils (CNFs) with a degree of carboxymethyl sub-
stitution of up to 0.25 to PEDOT:PSS resulted in composite
materials with an electrical conductivity of about 350 S cm−1.40
Many conjugated polymers, in particular those with alkyl side
chains, are soluble in apolar organic solvents, complicating
compounding with nanocellulose, which is typically processed
from polar solvents such as water or dimethylformamide
(DMF).
Here, we study the mechanical and electrochemical
properties of nanocomposites composed of the polar
polythiophene p(g42T-T) and CNF. The addition of CNF to
p(g42T-T) allows us to reinforce the polymer without affecting
the Tg (Figure 1) or the transconductance of nanocomposite-
based OECTs. Swelling of p(g42T-T):CNF nanocomposites
through water uptake results in a reversible decrease in elastic
modulus from E > 100 MPa to about 10 MPa or less, which
opens up the use of cellulose nanocomposites for the
preparation of mechanically adaptive materials for wearable
electronics and bioelectronics.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We chose to work with carboxymethylated CNF with a degree
of substitution of 0.1, i.e., 10% of the hydroxy groups of
cellulose have been replaced with a carboxymethyl group,
which has been found to allow the preparation of highly
conducting nanocomposites in the case of PEDOT:PSS and
CNF.40 A predetermined amount of a DMF solution of
p(g42T-T) was added to a DMF dispersion of carboxymethy-
lated CNF (see the Experimental Section for details). The
mixture was stirred for 1 h and then used to prepare
nanocomposite films by either drop casting (thick films) or
wire bar coating (thin films). The resulting nanocomposites
had a CNF content that varied from 0.6 to 33 vol % assuming
densities of 1 and 1.6 g cm−3 for p(g42T-T) and CNF,
respectively.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to assess the
distribution of CNF in the polymer matrix. Quantitative
analysis of the height of neat fibrils revealed a diameter of 4.6
± 1.1 nm. We were only able to distinguish the nanocellulose
in very thin films (thickness d ≈20 nm) containing at least 20
vol % CNF (Figure 2b). The recorded AFM images indicate
that a significant fraction of CNF is present as individual fibrils.
The observed fibrils on the film surface had a height of 2.7 ±
0.9 nm, which suggests that they are in part embedded in the
polymer matrix.
Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to determine
the impact of the nanocellulose on the Tg of the polymer. For
neat p(g42T-T), we obtained a Tg = −53 °C from the peak in
loss modulus (Figure S1). For the nanocomposites containing
11 and 20 vol % CNF, two peaks were observed, the first one
located at −46 and −52 °C and a second peak at 5 or −3 °C,
respectively (Figure S1). The presence of two Tg values can be
attributed to the existence of two types of domains in the
polymeric matrix, i.e., a bulk material with a similar Tg as neat
p(g42T-T) and a polymer layer close to the CNF surface where
chain motion is restricted, yielding a higher Tg. Note that
nanocellulose does not display a glass transition.42
Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) was performed to
analyze the crystalline order of neat p(g42T-T) and the
nanocomposites containing 3, 11, and 20 vol % CNF (Figure
S2). The WAXS diffractogram of neat p(g42T-T) featured two
peaks at q100 ≈0.35 Å−1 and q200 ≈0.72 Å−1, characteristic of
lamellar stacking.43 At higher wave vectors, only a broad
amorphous halo with a peak at q ≈1.6 Å−1 was present but no
π-stacking peak could be observed. The addition of CNF
results in a considerable decrease of the intensity of the
lamellar stacking peaks, which does not scale with the
remaining polymer content. Hence, it appears that the
presence of CNF disrupts lamellar stacking of the polymer
to some extent. Concomitantly, a distinct peak emerges at q200
≈1.62 Å−1 in the case of nanocomposites containing 11 and
20 vol % CNF (Figure S2), which we assign to the 200
diffraction of CNF,44 instead of π-stacking of the polymer
(which would appear at a similar position) since CNF appears
to disrupt its ability to order.

We used tensile deformation to compare the mechanical
properties of the p(g42T-T):CNF nanocomposites. The
Young’s modulus strongly increased upon the addition of
CNF from Em = 1 MPa for the neat polymer to E = 756 MPa
for p(g42T-T):CNF containing 27 vol % CNF (Figures 3a, S3
and Table S1). The value of neat p(g42T-T) is lower than a
previous measurement (see Figure 1),12 which we explain with
a lower degree of order of the here used polymer batch. The
elongation at break decreased from εb > 20% for a CNF
content of up to 3 vol % to εb ≲10% for larger amounts of
CNF. The experimentally obtained Young’s modulus values
were compared with those predicted by the Ouali and Halpin-
Tsai models, which can be used to describe the reinforcing
effect obtained for a percolating network of the reinforcing
agent and a material dominated by filler−matrix interactions,
respectively.45−47

where Vc is the percolation threshold (here given a value of 0.7

0.4 in the case of a three-dimensional (3D) network.46 The
modulus predicted by the Ouali model increases rapidly above
Vc, significantly exceeding experimental values (Figure 3b), and
thus, we argue that a reinforcing filler network is likely not a
good description of the here studied p(g42T-T):CNF
nanocomposites.

where Er is Young’s modulus of the reinforcing agent, here
given the value reported for cellulose I single crystals, i.e., Er =

Tsai model matches the experimental values up to 6 vol %
CNF (Figure 3b), and thus, we propose that a material
dominated by filler:matrix interactions is a reasonable
description of p(g42T-T):CNF nanocomposites with a low
CNF content. For higher CNF concentrations, the measured
Young’s modulus exceeds the values predicted by the Halpin-
Tsai model and instead approaches the values predicted by the
Ouali model, which we assign to partial aggregation of CNF
leading to an increased influence of filler:filler interactions.
In a further set of experiments, we explored the change in
mechanical properties of the nanocomposites upon swelling
through water uptake. Vacuum oven dried samples of p(g42T-
T):CNF nanocomposites with 11 to 33 vol % CNF were
immersed in deionized water for approximately 48 h (Figure
4a), immediately followed by tensile deformation since the
samples rapidly dried once removed from the water bath. Note
that the thickness of the p(g42T-T):CNF nanocomposite films
was not changed even after swelling and drying were repeated
3 times over the course of 5 days. Thus, it is clear that CNF
remains in the bulk films (see Figure S4a,b). We were unable
to carry out tensile deformation experiments with neat p(g42T-
T), which became too soft upon swelling. The water uptake of
the nanocomposites was estimated by comparing the weight of
dry and swollen samples, wdry and wswollen, expressed as the
swelling ratio according to:

All four studied compositions showed similar behavior with
a swelling ratio of about 2 and a water content of about 50%
(Table S2). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
spectra of swollen samples featured a broad peak at 3350 cm−1,
corresponding to the O−H stretch vibration, which signifi-
cantly decreased in magnitude upon drying under ambient
conditions for 15 min (Figure S5). Therefore, tensile
deformation of swollen nanocomposites was carried out
immediately after their removal from the deionized water
bath so that the time in air until the end of the tensile
deformation experiment did not exceed 10 min. Tensile
deformation experiments revealed that swollen samples
displayed a more than one order of magnitude lower Young’s
modulus of only E = 3−15 MPa, compared to dried samples
(Figures 4b, S6a and Table S1). The here observed significant
reduction in elastic modulus upon swelling with water is in
agreement with previous reports of other types of cellulose
nanocomposites, which albeit comprised non-conjugated
polymer matrices.20,50 To investigate the reversibility of the
swelling process, we dried the swollen nanocomposites by
placing them in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for ∼24 h. Tensile
deformation of swollen and then dried samples indicated that
nanocomposites with 11 and 20 vol % CNF were able to regain
the same degree of reinforcement, as evidenced by a similar
Young’s modulus before and after swelling/drying (Figures 4b
and S6b). Instead, for higher contents of 27 and 33 vol %
CNF, Young’s moduli of swollen and dried samples were
somewhat lower than those of the as-cast material, which we
explain with irreversible structural changes upon swelling.
AFM allowed us to compare the texture and thickness of dry
and swollen thin films. AFM topography images reveal that
neat films are smooth with a low root-mean-square (RMS)
roughness of Rsq = 0.8 nm in the case of neat p(g42T-T) and a
slightly higher value of Rsq = 1.0 nm for a nanocomposite film
containing 20 vol % CNF (Figures 5 and S6a,c), indicating that
CNF is embedded in the film. However, the roughness and
thickness significantly increased when submerging the films in
deionized water. AFM topography images of films submerged
in deionized water revealed a roughness of Rsq = 7.3 nm and a
swelling ratio of dswollen/ddry = 1.43 ± 0.16 for neat, swollen
p(g42T-T), and values of 4.4 nm and 1.30 ± 0.09 for a
nanocomposite film containing 20 vol % CNF (see Figure 5b;
dswollen and ddry are the thickness of swollen and dry films,
respectively). Thin films experience a lesser degree of passive
swelling compared to bulk samples (cf. Table S2), which has
also been observed for other materials such as ionomers and
was explained with confinement effects.51 AFM topography
images reveal a lower roughness as compared to the neat
polymer (Figures 5b and S7b,d). Swollen nanocomposite films
feature a lower roughness compared to neat, swollen p(g42T-
T), i.e., the presence of CNF results in films with a more fine-
grained texture. Repeated swelling and drying were carried out
for a nanocomposite film comprising 20 vol % CNF, and an
invariant film thickness after five cycles suggests that CNF
remains in the films (Figure S4). Hence, we were readily able
to fabricate electrochemical devices with the here studied
nanocomposites.
The hydrophilic nature of CNFs can be expected to alter the
transport of ions into polymer films during electrochemical
oxidation, which would influence the operation of electro-
chemical devices. We constructed planar devices that allowed

us to track the moving front of electrochromic color changes
upon application of an electrochemical potential, similar to the
experiments described by Stavrinidou et al. (see Figure 6a for
the schematic of the setup and the Experimental Section for
details).52 A potential of ϕ = 1 V vs Ag/AgCl was applied at
one end of the channel,53 and a CCD camera was used to
monitor the lateral change in color due to oxidation of the
polymer, which requires the ingression of Cl−ions from the
aqueous electrolyte (100 mM NaCl) into the film and thus
provides information about the mobility of Cl−ions. A
comparison of the optical images shown in Figure 6b reveals
that after application of the electrical potential for 60 s, the
moving front has progressed further into nanocomposite films
compared to neat p(g42T-T), indicating a higher ion mobility.
The position of the moving front l(t) as a function of time t
(see Figure S8a) allowed us to determine the mobility of Cl−
ions μCl

For neat p(g42T-T), we extract an ion mobility of μCl

which increases to 3.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a nanocomposite
film containing 20 vol % CNF (Figure 6c). We conclude that
the addition of CNF to p(g42T-T) results in a slightly
enhanced mobility of Cl−ions in nanocomposite films.
OECTs were fabricated to investigate how the addition of
CNF impacts the electrochemical response of p(g42T-T).
Transfer curves of devices with active layers composed of neat
p(g42T-T) were compared with devices based on nano-
composites containing 3, 11, or 20 vol % CNF. All transfer
curves feature low current levels at positive gate voltages VGS

operation. The dimension-normalized transconductance gm* =
|dIDS* /dVGS| of all devices is comparable (Figure 7a), indicating
that the presence of non-conducting CNF does not
significantly affect the electrical properties of the materials.

We obtain a value of μC* = 135 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for neat
p(g42T-T), which is not significantly affected by the addition
of CNF and comparable to values reported for p(g32T-T), a
similar polymer with shorter triethylene glycol side chains.54
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for poten-
tials ranging from −0.4 to 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl (Figure S10)
allowed us to determine the volumetric capacitance C*, which
displayed a maximum value Cmax
*
at a potential of +0.4 V vs
Ag/AgCl (Figure S11). The C* values from EIS in
combination with the μC* values from OECT transfer curves
were used to calculate the mobility. Trajectories of μ vs C*
reveal a comparable trend for both neat p(g42T-T) and the
investigated nanocomposites with 3, 11, and 20 vol % CNF
(Figure 7b). Both parameters first increase and reach
maximum values at VGS = −0.4 V, followed by a slight
decrease at higher oxidation potentials, in agreement with
previous reports for similar polymers such as a thienothio-
phene−thiophene copolymer with oligoether side chains.54
The maximum capacitance Cmax
*
increased with the CNF
content from 162 to 197 F cm−3 (Figure 7c and Table 1).
Instead, the maximum mobility μmax slightly decreased with the
CNF content from μmax = 0.83 cm2 V−1 s−1 for neat p(g42T-T)
to 0.65 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the nanocomposite with 20 vol % CNF
(Table 1 and Figure 7d). The increase in Cmax
*
indicates that
the presence of CNF aids the accumulation of charge carriers
upon application of a negative VGS, which compensates for the
slight decrease in charge-carrier mobility, overall resulting in
invariant values of μC* and hence a transconductance that is
not affected by the presence of CNF (see Figure 7a). We argue
that the more fine-grained texture of swollen nanocomposite
films as compared to neat p(g42T-T) (see the AFM images in
Figure 5) results in additional grain boundaries that slightly
impede charge transport but increase the internal surface area
where electrochemical oxidation can occur.
The addition of CNF increases the ionic mobility without
affecting μC*, which may accelerate the response of OECTs to
changes in the input gate potential, an advantage for circuit
design. To verify that CNF composites display faster switching
behavior, we fabricated OECT devices with a patterned active
layer with a size of 220 × 100 μm2 for the channel (W/L = 100
μm/20 μm). The contact region had a size of 100 × 100 μm2
to minimize parasitic capacitance, which can strongly influence
the transient response. Then, the drain current IDS was
recorded while applying a constant VDS of −0.6 V and voltage
steps on the gate electrode, i.e., VGS = 0 to −0.6 V and −0.6 to
0 V for turning devices ON and OFF, respectively. Time
constant values τon and τoff were extracted from the time-
dependent drain current by using eqs 9 and 10:

where Ion is a steady-state on-current at VGS = −0.6 V and VDS
= −0.6 V, and t is the time after applying the voltage step (see
Figure 8a). To facilitate a precise analysis of the transient
response, we obtained τ and Ion values from 20 devices, which
were prepared with an identical mask layout. The transient
response of OECTs depends on the material properties (e.g.,
C* and μCl
−) as well as the exact device dimensions (e.g.,
channel dimensions and area of the active layer) and parasitic
capacitance from the metal electrodes. However, since both Ion
and τ are proportional to the thickness of the active layer, plots
of τ vs Ion facilitate a fair comparison of the transient response
of different active-layer materials (Figure 8b).
OECTs based on p(g42T-T):CNF nanocomposites dis-
played a higher switching speed than devices with a neat
p(g42T-T) active layer. For Ion = 0.5 mA, for example, we
extrapolate values of τon = 3.72 ms and τoff = 0.43 ms for neat
polymer devices, while for nanocomposite devices, we obtain
lower values of τon = 1.93 ms and τoff = 0.29 ms (Figure 8).
Hence, the addition of 20 vol % CNF to p(g42T-T) results in a
1.9 and 1.5 times faster ON and OFF switching speed,
respectively. Even though the nanocomposite has a slightly
higher volumetric capacitance and lower charge-carrier
mobility than the neat polymer, which would suggest lower
switching speeds for identical current output, the higher ionic
mobility of the nanocomposite films appears to improve the
transient response of OECTs.
To rule out that differences in active swelling, i.e., water
uptake upon the application of an electrochemical potential,
cause the observed decrease in μmax with the CNF content, we
also carried out chemical doping with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-
tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ). P(g42T-T) and CNF
were coprocessed with 20 mol % F4TCNQ (relative to the
g42T-T repeat unit), resulting in thin films with an electrical
conductivity of about 20 S cm−1 (Table 1). Previous studies
have shown that the selected dopant concentration results in
highly doped films and does not negatively affect the
nanostructure of the polymer.6,12 UV−vis spectra of doped
films featured distinct polaronic absorption peaks in the near-
infrared part of the spectrum as well as two additional peaks
around 1.5 eV that are characteristic of F4TCNQ anions. We
estimated the fraction of ionized dopant molecules by
comparing the UV−vis spectra around 3 eV with previously
reported absorption spectra of neutral F4TCNQ and its anion
(Figure S12).55 Assuming that each F4TCNQ anion gives rise
to one polaron on the polymer backbone, we were able to
estimate the number of charge carriers (polarons) Np, which
allowed us to determine the charge-carrier mobility according
to

where e is the elementary charge (Table 1). A value of Np ≈
0.7 × 1026 m−3 yields a value of μF
d4TCNQ = 2.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for
neat p(g42T-T), which decreases to 1.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the
nanocomposite with 20 vol % CNF, in agreement with the
slight decrease in charge-carrier mobility deduced from OECT
devices (Table 1).
■CONCLUSIONS
Coprocessing of the polar polythiophene p(g42T-T) with
carboxymethylated CNF allows the preparation of nano-
composites that in the dry state feature a Young’s modulus of
more than 400 MPa, an increase by more than two orders of
magnitude compared to the neat polymer. Moreover, passive
swelling of the nanocomposites resulted in a reversible
decrease in modulus to 10 MPa or less. The addition of
CNF to p(g42T-T) enhances the mobility of Cl−ions but
results in a slight decrease in electronic mobility compared to
the neat polymer, with values of 3.6 × 10−5 and 0.65 cm2 V−1
s−1 for nanocomposites comprising 20 vol % CNF. At the same
time, nanocomposites featured an improvement in volumetric
capacitance, reaching a value of Cmax
*
= 197 F cm−3 for
nanocomposites comprising 20 vol % CNF. Overall, OECTs
reveal an invariant transconductance but a higher switching
speed upon the addition of CNF to the channel. Evidently,
CNF can be used as a reinforcing agent for polymers with
oligoether side chains, which allows one to modulate the
mechanical properties and, in addition, improves the electro-
chemical performance of the polymer. The combination of
reversible passive swelling and invariant transconductance
facilitates the design of mechanically adaptive mixed ionic-
electronic conductors for wearable electronics and bioelec-
tronics.
■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Materials. p(g42T-T) with a number-average molecular weight Mn
= 21 kg mol−1 and polydispersity index PDI = 5.9 was synthesized
according to a previously reported procedure.6 A 2.6 wt % aqueous
dispersion of carboxymethylated CNF with a degree of substitution of
0.1 was provided by the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE).
Solvent exchange from water to DMF resulted in a dispersion of 0.9
wt % CNF in DMF, using the following procedure: (1) 400 mL of
DMF (purity ≥99.9% purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a
round-bottom flask containing 2 g of the aqueous CNF dispersion;
(2) the mixture was sonicated for 20 min and then stirred for 30 min
using a homogenizer; and (3) a rotary evaporator at a temperature of
80 °C was used to remove the solvent. The above process was
repeated 4 times to ensure complete water removal and exchange to
DMF. F4TCNQ and silver paint were purchased from TCI Chemicals
and Agar Scientific, respectively.
Sample Preparation. Nanocomposites were prepared by stirring
a solution of p(g42T-T) in DMF (8 g L−1 for thin films or 12 g L−1 for
thick films) with a dispersion of 0.9 wt % CNF in DMF at different
ratios for 1 h using a magnetic stirrer, resulting in p(g42T-T):CNF
dispersions that contained a solid content of 0.6 to 33 vol % CNF
[calculated assuming a density of 1 and 1.6 g cm−3 for p(g42T-T) and
CNF]. Doping with F4TCNQ was done by coprocessing p(g42T-
T):CNF mixtures in DMF with F4TCNQ (2 g L−1 in acetonitrile).
Thin films for spectroscopy and conductivity measurements (thick-
ness d ≈70 nm) as well as for electrochemical characterization
(thickness d = 140−230 nm for OECTs and liquid AFM and 50 nm
for EIS devices) were prepared by wire bar coating on glass substrates
at 45 °C using a K101 control coater from RK Print Instruments
(wire diameter = 50 μm). Thick films for tensile testing and WAXS
were fabricated by drop casting multiple layers on glass substrates at
45 °C (thickness d ≈100 μm), followed by drying under vacuum for
∼48 h and finally being removed from the glass substrate with a sharp
blade. The film thickness of thin and thick films was measured with
AFM or an AlphaStep D-100 profilometer from KLA and micro-
calipers, respectively.
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AFM images were recorded in
tapping mode using a MultiMode SPM microscope equipped with a
Nanoscope IV Controller from Veeco (Figure 2) or an NTEGRA
NT-DMT instrument (Figures 6 and S7). Topography images of

swollen films were obtained in liquid AFM mode in deionized water
after immersing the as-prepared films in deionized water for 12 h.
Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS). Transmission WAXS
diffractograms were obtained under vacuum using a Mat:Nordic
instrument from SAXLAB equipped with a Rigaku 003+ high
brilliance microfocus Cu-radiation source (wavelength = 1.5406 Å)
and a Dectris Pilatus 300K detector. Samples were placed at a
distance of 134 mm from the sample and irradiated for 1800 s. The
sample-to-detector distance was calibrated using silver behenate
powder. The SaxsGUI software was used for data reduction.
Tensile Testing. Tensile testing of free-standing thick films was
performed using a Q800 dynamic mechanical analyzer from TA
Instruments at room temperature in controlled force mode with a
force rate of 0.005 N/min using a gauge length of 3.8 mm. To ease
fastening between the linear film tension clamps, samples of neat
p(g42T-T) and nanocomposites containing up to 4 vol % CNF were
fixated in a paper frame that was cut prior to tensile testing.
UV−vis−NIR Absorption Spectroscopy. UV−vis−NIR spectra
of thin films were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050
spectrophotometer.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). FTIR
spectra were recorded in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode
using a PerkinElmer Frontier FTIR instrument equipped with a
GladiATR attachment from Pike Technologies.
Ion Mobility Measurements. Active layers were bar-coated on
pre-cleaned indium-doped tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates
and patterned with a swab soaked in chloroform (width = 10 mm;
length = 30 mm). Then, paraffin films were deposited on the ion-
channel region and molten by placing the devices on a hot plate at 60
°C for 5 min. During the measurements, one end of the devices was
electrically connected with a Cu clip, and the other end was dipped in
an aqueous electrolyte (100 mM NaCl). A potential of ϕ = 1 V vs Ag/
AgCl was applied at the ITO working electrode with a Keithley 2400
source-measure unit using a three-electrode configuration that
comprised a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode.
The potential of ϕ = 1 V vs Ag/AgCl was applied for 5 min, and a
video of the channel was recorded with a Canon EOS RP camera. To
remove the background, all images (frame rate = 30 fps) of the video
were divided by a frame recorded at 0 V vs Ag/AgCl (dedoped state).
Intensity profiles along the ion channels were acquired for each frame
using the ImageJ software. For each normalized intensity profile, the
distance l between the start of the channel and the location where the
intensity had dropped to 50% of the initial value was determined
using MATLAB. The ion mobility was extracted by plotting l2 vs t
(Figure S8b; see eq 7).
OECT Fabrication and Characterization. The metal electrodes
of OECT devices were prepared via lithography. First, the source and
drain electrodes were defined via a lift-off process using a Karl Suss
MA6 contact aligner and a Kurt J Lesker PVD225 e-beam evaporator
on cleaned Marienfeld soda lime glass slides, resulting in channels
with a width W = 200 μm and length L = 20 μm. Then, active layers
with a thickness of d = 140−230 nm were wire bar-coated. The active
layers are not patterned but partially removed near the contact pads
with a swab soaked in chloroform. Finally, a 20−30 μL drop of an
aqueous electrolyte (100 mM NaCl) was placed on top of the active
layer. Device characterization was conducted with two MATLAB-
controlled Keithley 2400 source-measure units, with a Ag/AgCl
reference electrode (RE-1B from ALS) immersed in the electrolyte as
the gate electrode. For analysis of the transient response, the drain
current was electrically bypassed and recorded using a Stanford
Research Systems SR570 preamplifier and a DAQ board from
National Instruments.
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Films with a
thickness of d ≈50 nm were wire bar-coated on ITO-coated glass
substrates (Ossila, 20 Ω sq−1). The active layer was patterned with a
swab soaked in chloroform, and its area (A ≈40 mm2) and thickness
were measured with a CCD camera and AFM, respectively. Finally,
the ITO contact was contacted with crocodile clips, passivated with
paraffin wax, and then, the sample was immersed in an aqueous
electrolyte (100 mM NaCl). EIS spectra were obtained with a CH
instrument CHI 650D using a conventional three-electrode
configuration that comprised a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a
Pt counter electrode. The offset potential was varied from +0.4 to
−0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl with a 20 mV peak-to-peak sinusoidal signal
(frequency of 10−1 to 105 Hz). The electrochemical capacitance of the
active layer was extracted from EIS data using the EIS Spectrum
Analyser
software
and
an
equivalent
circuit
model
Re[RsCs[Rc[RaCa]]], where Re, Rs, Cs, Rc, Ra, and Ca are the resistance
of the electrolyte, electrochemical resistance/capacitance of the ITO
substrate, contact resistance between the substrate and the active
layer, and electrochemical resistance/capacitance of the active layer
(see Figure S10a for a circuit diagram). The obtained values for Ca
were normalized by the volume (=d × A) of each sample.
Electrical Characterization. The sheet resistance Rs = π/ ln 2 ·
V/I of thin films on glass substrates, where V and I are the measured
voltage and current, respectively, was measured with a four-point
probe setup from Jandel Engineering (cylindrical probe head,
RM3000) using co-linear tungsten carbide electrodes with an
equidistant spacing of 1 mm. The electrical conductivity was
calculated according to σ = 1/(dRs), where d is the film thickness.
