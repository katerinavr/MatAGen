1. Introduction
Organic 
electrochemical 
transistors 
(OECTs) are gaining momentum as next 
generation biosensors.[1–6] The first three 
gold electrode-based OECT device was 
first demonstrated by White et al. in 1984, 
using conducting polypyrrole as its active 
layer.[7] Intensive research efforts invested 
into physical modeling were instru-
mental to understand and master both 
the steady-state and transient responses of 
OECTs.[8] Replacing conducting polypyr-
role with a third generation conducting 
polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedi-
oxythiophene) doped with polystyrene 
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) allowed extrac-
tion of figures-of-merit (FoMs) values 
competing with current state-of-the-art 
electrolyte-gated transistors, especially for 
gm transconductance

value.[9] In PEDOT:PSS based-OECT, a 
positive biased Gate voltage (VGS) drags 
negative ions out of the full volume of a 
gating electrolyte. Oppositely, countered 
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) are gaining momentum in 
future applications of biosensors and bioelectronics. Nonetheless, contact 
(or series) resistances (RS/D) remain underexplored, even though physical 
processes between the source/drain electrodes and organic mixed ionic-
electron conductors (OMIECs) drive a substantial part of their performances. 
To address this shortcoming, in this study, low-dimension OECTs featuring 
2 µm-long poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrene sulfonate 
acid (PEDOT:PSS) channel are explored. Normalized contact resistances 
(RS/D⋅W) values as low as 1.4 W cm are obtained. It is observed that channel 
PEDOT:PSS thickness is not detrimental to RS/D but is impacting the cut-off 
frequency. A figure-of-merit (h) expressing the charge-carrier injection (or 
extraction, respectively) efficiency shows that planar depletion-mode OECTs 
are not contact-limited up to L = 30 µm channel length. Finally, an unprec-
edented approach that highlight the importance of optimizing the micro-
fabrication technologies is shown, by decreasing the contact overlap length, 
according to OMIECs physicochemical contact properties. Indeed, a transfer-
length method coupled to a current-crowding model allow to fully understand 
the behavior of low-dimension PEDOT:PSS OECTs and next, to optimize its 
circuits design. This is paving the way toward the development of OECTs-
based integrated circuits with faster switching speed, broadening further their 
scopes and future use as advanced bioelectronics platforms.

positive ions enter into the bulk of PEDOT:PSS thin-film and 
pair up with fixed negative charges from PSS by electrostatic 
interactions. Consequently, the number of free charge carriers 
is decreasing onto the PEDOT backbone. Due to the application 
of a positive VGS bias, the current between Source and Drain 
(IDS) is consequently decreasing, leading to a so-called deple-
tion mode PEDOT:PSS OECT. Electronic charge carriers within 
OECTs (i.e., polarons and bipolarons) are relatively mobile 
under the negative Source and Drain voltage (VDS) bias applied. 
In a nutshell, OECT relies on ionic-to-electronic transduction 
in a three-terminal device configuration, exhibiting two-key 
parameters: i) the time for ions (τi) to enter into the bulk of the 
channel consisting of organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor 
(OMIEC) and ii) the time for electronic charge carriers (τe) to 
transit from Source to Drain (S&D) electrodes (Figure 1a,b). 
Ion permeability, swelling effect, channel thickness, volumetric 
capacitance dependencies of PEDOT:PSS have been exten-
sively studied, discussed and commented in the literature to 
rationalize the observation of high FoM values.[10–13] Nonethe-
less, the underlying physics and electrochemistry of OECTs are 
not completely understood till date, some critical mechanisms 
remaining underexplored.[14] This is notoriously the case of the 
injection (or extraction) efficiency of electronic charge carriers 
localized at the interface between the PEDOT:PSS channel and 
the Source (or Drain, respectively) electrode. This is particularly 
surprising since an interfacial mechanism is driving the final per-
formance of any transistor devices, particularly when it comes 
to reach bioelectronics logic circuits and neuromorphic applica-
tions.[15–17] A recent publication confirmed such importance by 
evaluating the influence of disorder on transfer characteristics 
of OECTs for which the contact resistance (RS or RD) amount 
compared to the total resistance of the device (ROECT) was lim-
iting the performances of OECTs featuring PEDOT:PSS as its 
OMIEC-based channel material.[18] From an analytical modeling 
approach, Lüssem et al. reported the effect of contact resistance 
on PEDOT:PSS OECTs with different doping level.[19] Even if 
addressed through a modeling approach, such limiting param-
eters have not been experimentally investigated till date in 
lower dimension channel OECT (L < 50 µm).[20,21] Nonetheless,  
this evaluation is critical to enable the advanced design of 
higher performance OECT electronic devices and the integra-
tion density of these building blocks into electronic circuitry 
without altering their intrinsic electronic performance.
In this work, we investigate these issues in low-dimension 
OECTs, varying the OECT’s channel length (L) from 30  µm 
down to 2 µm with a <5 µm overlap contact length (
C
fab
L ) between 
the S&D electrodes and using PEDOT:PSS as the channel 
material. Normalized contact resistance values (RS/D⋅W) as low 
as 1.4 Ω cm are obtained. For planar OECTs, it was found that 
PEDOT:PSS channel thickness is not detrimental to RS/D but 
is strongly affecting the cut-off frequency. PEDOT:PSS OECT 
dynamic response shows a total OECT switching time (τOECT) 
of 85 µs (i.e., ≈12 kHz) versus an electronic switching time (τe) 
of 2.8 µs (i.e., ≈357 kHz) that is contradictory with the meas-
ured cut-off frequency. This is confirming that ionic switching 
time (τi) is drastically limiting OECTs dynamic response. A 
charge-carrier injection (or extraction, respectively) efficiency 
FoM is showing that planar depletion-mode OECTs are not 
contact-limited up to L = 30 µm channel length. LC is below the 
calculated characteristic contact length (LT) for planar or stag-
gered OECTs, implying that series resistances should be there-
fore considered as affected by technological micro-fabrication. 
Finally, considering that the length at the convergent point 
(Lconv) is acting as an “extension length” in the channel resist-
ance, for L < −Lconv, the nature of the Source (or Drain)/OMIEC 
contact is definitively affecting the dynamic response of OECTs.

(e.g., consisting here in a liquid electrolyte). This electrolyte is 
in intimate contact with the PEDOT:PSS active layer and coated 
atop the S&D electrodes in the case of planar OECTs. The 
PEDOT:PSS channel material here is formulated to improve its 
bulk dc-conductivity up to 740 S cm−1 (see Experimental Section).
Planar (Figure  1a) versus staggered (Figure  1b) OECTs are 
simply defined and differentiated by varying the number of 
spin-coated PEDOT:PSS layers with an unchanged gold S&D 
electrodes thickness. We succeeded in tuning the PEDOT:PSS 
channel layer from one to three PEDOT:PSS spin-coated layers 
(see Experimental Section). The channel thickness of OECTs is 
evaluated through the extraction of capacitance values from a 
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements 
setup, as previously reported.[22] Capacitances are extracted for 
all investigated channel areas (W⋅L), in case of planar or stag-
gered OECTs (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Fitted slopes 
in Figure S1 (Supporting Information) were found to be similar 
to the interfacial capacitance either capacitance per unit area 
(Ci in F cm−2) or Double Layer capacitance (CDL) that usually 
establish (O)FETs or EG(O)FETs FoMs.[23–28] Considering that 
the PEDOT:PSS capacitance per unit volume (C*) is largely 
reported in the literature for the exact similar PEDOT:PSS 
formulation used here, we directly extract the OECTs thick-
nesses.[12,27] For 
PEDOT:PSS

 39 F cm−3 and Ci = CDL = d⋅C*, cal-
culated thicknesses are dplanar ≈ 220 nm and dstaggered ≈ 690 nm, 
respectively. We notice that the ratio of slopes in Figure S1 
(Supporting Information) for one or three spin-coated layers 
is 27/8.74 ≈ 3.09; a ratio that is in a very good agreement with 
the ratio of spin-coated layers. The gold S&D electrodes are 
200 nm-thick in all OECT devices (see Experimental Section). 
Figure 1c shows an optical microphotograph of fabricated low-
dimensional OECTs with channel length (L) down to ≈2  µm. 
S&D gold electrodes (200 nm-thick) are protected by a parylene 
C (transparent) layer, except in the opening filled by light blue-
colored PEDOT:PSS layer (Figure 1c). The microfabrication step 
involving the second photomask alignment is the critical step 
to achieve low overlap contact lengths (LC) between an OMIEC 
and S&D electrodes (Figure S2). Micro-fabricated OECTs used 
in this work show typically LC  ≈  5  µm overlap and channel 
lengths (L) varying from 32, 22, 11, 6, 3 µm (down to 2 µm) for 
2 different channel widths (W = 25 µm or W = 50 µm) (2 col-
umns of 2 × 5 OECTs) (Figure S3, Supporting Information).
2.1.2. Channel Thickness and Length Effects on Figures-of-Merits 
(FoMs)
Transconductance (in the Saturation Regime) and µOECTC* 
Characteristics: Figure 2a shows typical output curve of a 
PEDOT:PSS OECT below 1 V, with negative, VDS, and positive, 
VGS, varying from 0 to +0.6 V.
A low VGS is maximizing the current (IDS) flowing between 
Source and Drain electrodes, whereas a large VGS is decreasing 
IDS, as expected for a depletion-mode OECT. For low VDS 
(VDS  <  −0.05  V), linear IDS dependence was observed, high-
lighting no particular Series Resistances at Source and Drain 
electrode (RS/D) effects. At higher VGS and VDS, IDS is going 
first through a saturation effect but also toward a “negative” 
resistance (VGS = 0.4; 0.5; 0.6 V) since IDS is going below the 
saturation Drain current. From gm transconductance, we extract 
µOECTC* as:

where W, L, and d are the channel width, length and thickness, 
respectively; µ is the charge-carrier mobility; C* is the capaci-
tance per unit volume of the channel; and VTh is the threshold 
voltage. The µOECTC* product is increasing according to the 
channel length (L) (Figure 2b), both in case of planar or stag-
gered OECTs. Nonetheless, the µOECTC* product is not rigor-
ously linearly dependent in the case of planar OECTs. It is 
noteworthy that a µOECTC* dispersion was already reported for 
PEDOT:PSS OECTs and is mitigating such a trend.[29] More-
over, the µOECTC* product is reaching higher values in case of 
thinner planar channel OECTs (Figure  2b). Such dependen-
cies on the geometrical thickness (d) and length (L) are theo-
retically expected from Equation (1). Figure 2b plots µOECTC* 
values where gm was considered to its maximal values. 
The VGS to apply (in order to get a maximal gm) (

decreasing as long as L increases and seems to reach a plateau 
starting from L ≈ 20 µm (Figure 2b). Moreover,

or thickness (d). From Figure 2b, one can observe that µOECT 
is ranging, according to the channel length, from 0.6 to 
4.9  cm2  V−1  s−1 (planar or staggered OECTs taken together). 
These values are in agreement with PEDOT:PSS OECTs 
reported values in the literature.[29,30] Such a device behavior 
implies that one has to take into account i) an effective charge 
carrier mobility, or similarly, contact resistances (RS/D) effects 
or ii) disordered charge transport effects.
Dynamic Temporal Characteristics and Cut-Off Frequency: 
We investigated the dynamic response of OECTs according 
to a pulse square-wave with a ΔVGS = 0.6 V amplitude during 
Δt  =  2  ms time duration. Figure 3a represents IDS dynamic 
response to the VGS pulse. The tested OECT device shows a 
moderate hysteresis for a response time (τOECT) of 84.6 µs (i.e., 
f  =  11.8  kHz) and 82.6  µs (i.e., f  =  12.1  kHz) in forward and 
backward sweeps, respectively. Such a response time takes into 
account the total OECT response time (τOECT), involving the 
ions transit time (τi) and the electronic charge carrier transit 
time (τe), consequently (Figure  1a). Electronic charge carrier 
mobility (µOECT) was extracted from Equation (1) in order to cal-
culate the electronic transit time (τe) following:

(2)
The τe values were found to be of ≈2.8 µs (i.e., fc = 357 kHz) 
and ≈5.1 µs (i.e., fc = 197 kHz) for planar and staggered OECTs, 
respectively (Figure S4, Supporting Information). OECT 
dynamic response is mainly limited by ions transit time (around 
τi ≈ 80 µs) as confirmed by direct measurements of OECT cut-
off frequencies (fc) (Figure 3b). One can notice importantly here 
that fc is far from 357  kHz, when only electronic charge car-
riers are considered. Here like in previous results reported in 
the literature,[12,31,32] staggered OECTs have a slower response 
time in respect to planar OECTs. Figure  3b clearly shows 
higher cutoff frequencies in case of planar (or thinner) OECTs 
for each channel length. From those experimental results, 
we observe that the time for ions to deplete the PEDOT:PSS 
channel layer is lower in case of planar thinner OECTs. Indeed, 
it is not counter-intuitive to analyze that the cutoff frequency 
will be higher in case of thinner layer to deplete. It is then not 
surprising to observe cutoff frequencies damaged properties 
from thinner to thicker devices. This result also clearly states 
that the ions switching time is limiting OECTs performance. 
We notice a saturation effect at ≈7 kHz for L < 3 µm in case 
of planar OECTs. We point here that the cut-off frequencies’ 
physical expression [fc inversely proportional to the L⋅(L + LC) 
product] do not satisfactorily fit the data displayed in Figure 3b.
Figure S5 (Supporting Information) shows the transfer char-
acteristics for low VDS  =  −0.1  V, at different channel lengths 
in case of planar PEDOT:PSS OECTs. From VGS  =  +0.2  V 
to VGS = +0.6 V, IDS is increasing when the channel length is 
increasing, except for the lowest channel length, L  =  2.2  µm. 
This trend is in accordance with Figure 3b results. Indeed, there 
is a cutoff frequency saturation at the similar lowest channel 
length, L  =  2.2  µm. This is indicating a velocity saturation of 
charge carriers and thus a short-channel effect around L = 2 µm 
in planar PEDOT:PSS OECT. Nonetheless, such a statement is 
not taking into account overlapping effects of the PEDOT:PSS 
channel layer on the Source and Drain electrodes (Figure 1c).
2.2. Contact Resistances (RS/D) and Characteristic Injection 
Length (LT)
2.2.1. Contact Resistances (RS/D)
The Transfer-Length Method (TLM) was used to calculate the 
contact (or series) resistances that arise at the interface between 
the Source (or Drain) electrode and the OMIEC (PEDOT:PSS) 
channel. It is a widespread method that is regularly used 
in (O)TFTs.[33–40] TLM is using a series of OECTs with dif-
ferent channel lengths measured at low source-drain voltage 
(Figure 4a). TLM is not destructive and does not disrupt the 
OMIEC thin-film morphology, since values are calculated exclu-
sively using an analytical analysis. The total OECT resistance is

where RS/D is the contact (or series) resistance; Rch is the 
channel resistance; µi and VTh,i are the intrinsic mobility and 
threshold voltage, which represent conductive channel mate-
rial, without the influence of series resistances. By plotting 
normalized total resistance ROECT.W according to the channel 
length (L) and after extrapolating the experimental data with 
linear curves, the y-intercept (i.e., L  =  0) reveals the total 
series resistances (RS + RD) while the slope gives the channel 
resistance per unit length (i.e., 
ch
ch
r
R
W
=
) which is representa-
tive to the conduction channel material. Figure 4a shows nor-
malized contact resistance (RS/D⋅W) values as low as 1  Ω  cm 
for VGS = 0.3 V, closely corresponding to VGS where gm is maxi-
mized. Over the OECT ON-resistance (i.e., VGS = 0.5 V) to the 
OECT OFF-resistance (i.e., VGS = 0.1 V) regimes, RS/D⋅W is not 
exceeding 1.4 Ω cm. Such contact (or access) resistances (RS/D) 
are remarkably low, particularly compared to OFETs. Indeed, in 
depletion mode, PEDOT:PSS OECT switches from ON-state to 
OFF-state for applied positive Gate voltage (from VGS = 0 V to 
VGS = +0.6 V) (Figure 2a). For low Gate voltage, the impedance 
mismatch between the metal gold electrode and the channel 
layer will be low, since the PEDOT:PSS channel layer is in a 
highly doped state (i.e., conducting). Moreover, gold work func-
tion is aligned with PEDOT:PSS HOMO level, making “ohmic” 
contact. This explains why contact resistances are low; par-
ticularly when compared to OFETs. Moreover, it is stated that 
PEDOT :PSS (or CPs) is showing low interface dipole, induced 
by contacts doping effect.[38,41–43] Moreover, the work function 
of pristine PEDOT is lower than that of gold, giving rise to an 
interface potential difference and heavy doping at low voltage. 
The charging of the PEDOT:PSS interface creates an Elec-
trical-Double Layer.[44] At the opposite, “intrinsic” (non-doped) 
organic semiconductors (OSCs) (small molecules or polymers)/
Metal interfaces show higher contact resistance, because of a 
more pronounced interface dipole existence. Charges injection 
on OSC or CPs/Metal contacts are modeled between Mott–
Schottky and Bardeen interfaces. It is commonly adopted that 
organic electronics devices rely on both models.
Lconv is regarded as an equivalent extension of channel resist-
ance.[45] Staggered or Planar OECTs show contact resistance 
(RS/D) dependency to VGS until 0.3 V (Figure 4b). Below such 
a VGS value, the resistance to the injection (or to the extraction) 
of charge carriers is similar for staggered or planar OECT. This 
potentially contradicting result at first sight can in fact be rec-
onciled by considering that PEDOT:PSS OECTs are operating in 
depletion-mode. Indeed, at low depletion state (i.e., low + VGS), 
PEDOT:PSS OECT is highly doped. The PEDOT:PSS HOMO 
energetic level and the Au (Source/Drain) work function ener-
getic level are aligned (around 5.0–5.2 eV): there is no energy 
barrier to the current flowing, almost making “Ohmic” contact. 
IDS current is flowing through the interface (i.e., the contact) 
without “resistance”: RS/D is thus low. Thin (low exchanged-
surface with the contact) or thick (high exchanged-surface 
with the contact) channel PEDOT:PSS layer is not limiting the 
contact injection (extraction, respectively) efficiency because 
the channel layer is in a highly doped Level. At high depletion 
state, (i.e., high + VGS), PEDOT:PSS channel layer is depleted 
with a low doping level (i.e., there are almost no free charge 
carriers). The number of charge carriers injected into the 
PEDOT:PSS becomes greater than that present at equilibrium 
(i.e., depleted case). The excess charge then forms a space-
charge zone, creating an electric field opposing the injection of 
the carriers. PEDOT:PSS is observing a Space-Charge Limited 
Current (SCLC) effect. A screening effect is occurring at the 
Metal-conducting polymer interface (i.e., contact). The charge 
carrier injection (or extraction, respectively) efficiency is low-
ered, RS/D are thus increasing. In such a de-doped state, higher 
is the exchanged surface between the Metal and the conducting 
polymers, higher is the contact-limited effect. This means that 
RS/D will increase more according to VGS (i.e., de-dedoped state) 
for staggered “thick” OECTs. Experimental data in Figure  4b 
were fitted according to the model developed by Kaphle et al. 
where the dependency of the contact resistance can be fitted by 
an exponential dependency, as: RS/D = A × exp(B × VGS) + C.[19] 
Fitted parameters for staggered or planar PEDOT:PSS OECTs 
are regrouped in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Gate 
voltage is a depletion voltage and contact resistances grow expo-
nentially according the Gate Voltage. Indeed, Figure 1a shows 
the OFF-state of the PEDOT:PSS OECT as the Gate voltage

increases. In such an exponential growth dependency, the 
growth rate is similar for staggered or planar OECTs, between 
10 and 15 units per volts (V−1). That means the Gate voltage 
depletion effect is similar in any OECTs case. Contact resist-
ances are more increasing in case of shorter channel width 
(W). Indeed, as the fitting equation is showing, the multipli-
cation factor (A) is very different in case of the channel width 
(W  =  25  µm or W  =  50  µm). More especially, it is one order 
of magnitude larger for W = 25 µm channel width. Staggered 
and planar OECTs have similar PEDOT:PSS formulation, thus 
similar bulk conductivity and show thus similar contact resist-
ance at VGS = 0 V [RS/D (for VGS = 0 V) = A + C value]. Table 1 
summarizes the channel and series resistances values for the 
different case of OECTs, as well as a FoM, the charge-carrier 
injection efficiency (η) at the source electrode (or the extraction 
efficiency at the drain electrode, symmetrically):[38,46]

η is decreasing according to the channel length (Figure S6, Sup-
porting Information), since Rch is highly increasing according 
to the channel length. Interestingly, the channel resis­tance 
is always dominating the OECT behavior, meaning that 
PEDOT:PSS OECTs cannot be contact-limited for L < 20 µm. 
Such a physical meaning is of high interest for establishing 
geometrical design rules and envisioning OECT-based circuitry 
for (bio)electronic applications. By fitting such experimental 
data with exponential decay curves, we extrapolate this analysis 
to long channel lengths (L → ∞). As can be seen in Figure S6 
(Supporting Information) where the resistance to charge car-
rier injection (or extraction) is dominating over the OECT total 
resistance for L > 30 µm, this trend is not holding true for stag-
gered OECTs (Table 1).
2.2.2. Characteristic Injection (or Extraction) Length (LT)
The (O)TFT series resistances are closely related to the overlap 
between source (or drain) contact and gate contact (LC). In case 
of BC-TG OECTs, LC is determined by the Parylene C patterning 
that is insulating the electrolyte from the gold interconnec-
tions and source or drain contacts, thus patterning the OMIEC 
channel and overlap length (Figure 1b). In TFTs, the drain cur-
rent does not usually flow through the whole source or drain 
contact but is limited to a specific area of contact or is efficiently 
injected (or extracted) in a characteristic (effective) length (LT), 
expressed as:[47]

The characteristic injection (or extraction) length (LT) increases 
with channel thickness, the bulk density of states and the 
source-to-drain contact resistances.[48] It is a critical parameter 
for designing (O)TFTs. Its discussion is addressed hereinafter 
for OECTs. It is considered that there is no LT effect in case 
of planar OECTs since the OMIEC channel is not overlapping 
with the contact electrode (Figure 5a). Current-crowding model 
is thus to consider in case of staggered transistors. Above the

LT value, the contact dimension (LC) has no influence on the 
parasitic contact (or series) resistances, since the current does 
not flow through the further part of the source or drain con-
tact (inactive region) (Figure 5b). On the contrary, below LT, the 
whole contact area is active with respect to the current flow: 
the resistance is roughly proportional to the reciprocal of the 
contact dimension (Equation  (5)). Therefore, an increase in 
the contact dimension (LC) does not affect the OECT contact 
(or series) resistance, but at the expense of enhancing parasitic 
gate-to-source or gate-to-drain capacitances. This is detrimental to 
increase the cut-off frequency of OECTs.[49,50]
The TLM method allows the extrapolation of RS/D and Rch 
values (as expressed in Equation  (3) and reported in Table  1) 
from linear curve fits. All converge on the same point (i.e., 
indicated as point A in Figure  4a). On this convergent point 
A = [−Lconv; Rconv], Equation (3) can be modified as:[45]

LT is also calculated in the case of planar OECTs, since the 
PEDOT:PSS thickness (i.e., 220 nm-thick) is slightly higher than 
the gold contact electrodes (i.e., 200 nm-thick). This could be 
considered as the lowest contribution to current crowding effect 
we would validate, taking into consideration, as long as OECTs 
are fabricated by solution-process. LC is below LT for planar or 
staggered OECTs (Figure 6), meaning that series resistances 
should be therefore considered as affected by technological 
microfabrication issues. It should be logical then to increase 
LC to optimize the OECTs performances. This is without 
taking into account that cut-off frequency is decreasing with 
increasing LC. Indeed, increasing LC contributes to parasitic 
gate-to-source or gate-to-drain capacitances, corresponding to the 
inactive region, ΔL = LC − LT length difference, at the electrode/
OMIEC interface (Figure  5). Nonetheless, it is not physically 
relevant here since ΔL < 0. It does not explain thus the cut-off 
frequency saturation we observe in Figure 3b. Moreover, consid-
ering that Lconv is acting as an “extension length” in the channel 
resistance, for L < −Lconv = 2.8 µm, electrode/OMIEC contact is 
dominating the dynamic response of the OECT. Indeed, below 
–Lconv, cut-off frequency is starting to saturate for L < 3 µm, as 
observed in Figure  3b. Through an unprecedented approach, 
we experimentally prove here the importance to improve the 
OECTs micro-fabrication, as the layer-to-layer photolithography 
alignment, according to the electrode/OMIEC contact proper-
ties. We corroborate that the nature or the morphology of the 
interfacial layers, their doping states as well as the influence of 
defects or disorder in such OMIECs are of paramount impor-
tance in setting the overall OECTs performances.
3. Conclusion
We have designed and characterized depletion-mode OECTs 
with low-geometrical channel length (Lchannel  =  2  µm) and 
overlap contact length (LC = 5 µm) dimensions, showing nor-
malized contact resistances (RS/D⋅W) values as low as 1.4 Ω cm, 
where the gm transconductance is maximum. We observe that 
PEDOT:PSS channel thickness is not detrimental to RS/D but 
is affecting the cut-off frequency. PEDOT:PSS OECT dynamic 
response shows a total OECT switching time (τOECT) of 85 µs 
(i.e., ≈12 kHz) versus an electronic switching time (τe) of 2.8 µs 
(i.e., ≈357  kHz) that is contradictory with the measured cut-
off frequency, saturating at 7  kHz. First, this confirms that 
the ionic switching time (τi) is drastically limiting OECTs 
dynamic response. Moreover, the figure-of-merit expressing a 
charge-carrier injection efficiency at the contact (or extraction, 
respectively) shows that depletion-mode planar OECTs are not 
contact-limited up to L = 30 µm channel length. Finally, we take 
here an unprecedented approach to highlight the importance to 
optimize the micro-fabrication technologies for manufacturing 
higher performance OECTs, by decreasing the overlap length 
between the electrodes and the OMIEC, according to the elec-
trodes/OMIEC contact properties. Indeed, the application of 
the TLM coupled to a current-crowding model allowed us to 
better understand the behavior of low-dimension PEDOT:PSS 
OECTs and thus to optimize OECTs circuits design. We ana-
lyze that the overlap contact length (LC) remains below the 
measured characteristic contact lengths (LT) for planar or stag-
gered OECTs, implying that series resistances should be there-
fore considered as affected by technological micro-fabrication. 
Finally, considering that Lconv is acting as an “extension length” 
in channel resistance, for L < −Lconv, the nature of the Source 
(or Drain)/OMIEC contact is definitively affecting the dynamic 
response of OECTs. Such an approach is paving the way toward 
the development of OECTs-based integrated circuits with faster 
switching speed, broadening further their scope and future 
uses as advanced bioelectronics platforms.

4. Experimental Section
Thin-Film OECTs Microfabrication: A 10  nm-thick chromium layer 
was deposited by Vacuum Thermal Evaporation (VTE) at a 10−6  Torr 
vacuum base pressure to 0.1  Å  s−1 deposition rate. Consequently, 
200 nm-thick gold layer was deposited by VTE (at a 10−6 Torr vacuum 
base pressure; 1.0  Å  s−1 deposition rate), onto a 4  in. diameter glass 
wafer. AZ10XT (520 cps) photoresist (PR) was deposited by spin-coating 
for 35 s at 1750 rpm. An 8.9 µm-thick photoresist was exposed during 
14  s at 20  mW  cm−2 (@405  nm) through a chromium photomask 
with a Süss MicroTec MJB4 mask-aligner. The PR was baked at 110 °C 
for 120 s before to be developed with MF26A developer during 5 min. 
Consequently, Cr and Au layers were selectively etched in a hot NB Au 
etch 200 (Microchemicals) bath during 5 min at 60 °C. Finally, Cr layer 
was etched in a Technietch Cr01 bath. A first layer of 3 µm-thick Parylene 
C (PaC) was deposited (in a SCS coater), followed by the spin-coating of 
a Micro90 solution, and a second PaC layer (4 µm-thick) was deposited 
atop. Micro90 spin-coating decreased the adhesion between the 2 PaC 
layers. Photolithography and O2 Reactive Ion Etching (200 W, 10 sccm 
CF4, 50  sccm O2, 50  min) was used to open the access to S&D gold 
electrodes. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated for 30 s at 1500 rpm on such a 
patterned substrate. The second layer of PaC was removed by mechanical 
peeling, leaving the PEDOT:PSS only in the channel (Figure S1,  
Supporting Information). Parylene C film location was determining 
the overlap length (LC) between Source (or Drain) electrode and the 
electrolyte + Gate electrode.
For the preparation of the PEDOT:PSS films, 20  mL of aqueous 
dispersion (PH-1000 from Heraeus Clevios GmbH), 5  mL of ethylene 
glycol, ≈50  µL of dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid were mixed and 
sonicated before spin-coating. The films were subsequently baked 
at 140 °C for 1 h onto a hot plate and immersed in deionized water to 
remove the excess of low molecular weight compounds: this was defined 
as the sequence (A) for one spin-coated layer. Three PEDOT:PSS spin-
coated layers were deposited by repeating 3 times the A sequence. Four-
probe measurements were given 270  Ω  □−1. For a 50  nm thick-film, 
such a PEDOT:PSS formulation led to a bulk dc-conductivity value of 
≈740 S cm−1.

Measurements: Resistance along the gold interconnects was ≈40  Ω. 
This was considered as negligible in the data analysis since it only 
represented ≈10% the maximal measured RS/D resistance. These 
interconnects resistance level was similar for all devices investigated 
in this study; ruling out source of bias in the subsequently analyses 
performed. The PEDOT:PSS channel width, length, and overlap were 
measured through optical microscopy (Nikon) while the channel 
thickness was extracted with a mechanical profilometer (Dektak XT, 
Veeco). NaCl (100  mm) in deionized water was used as the liquid 
electrolytic medium, and a Ag/AgCl pellet as the gate electrode. 
A three-electrode configuration was used for the electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Metrohm), with 
platinum and Ag/AgCl counter and reference electrodes, respectively. 
The source and drain electrodes were shorted together, and the 
channel was used as the working electrode. In OECTs, the wiring of 
the OECT is illustrated in Figure 1a, in a common source configuration, 
and tested using a National Instruments (NI) PXI system and custom 
LabView software. The drain bias was applied using a NI PXIe-4145 
Source-Measure unit. A sinusoidal voltage signal was applied at the 
gate, with varying frequency and for amplitude of ΔVGS = 10 mV. The 
drain current was measured using the NI PXI 4071 Digital Multimeter 
and was synchronized with the measured gate voltage using the 
built-in PXI architecture.
