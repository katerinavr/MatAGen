Abstract
Polymeric mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) combine aspects
of conjugated polymers, polymer electrolytes, and polyelectrolytes to
simultaneously transport and couple ionic and electronic charges, opening
exciting new applications in energy storage and conversion, bioelectronics,
and display technologies. The many applications of polymeric MIECs lead
to a wide range of transport conditions. Ionic and electronic transport are
directly coupled through electrochemical doping, while the mechanisms
of ionic and electronic transport depend on distinctly different chemical
functionality, (macro)molecular structure, and morphology. Despite this,
ionic and electronic transport are surprisingly tunable, independent of one
another. We review the various types of polymeric MIECs, the mechanisms
of ionic and electronic charge transport across conditions, and the inter-
relations between the two, with special emphasis on the unique aspects of
polymeric MIEC transport phenomena.

1. INTRODUCTION
Initially, electronically conducting polymers and ionically conducting polymers were developed
separately. Electronically conducting polypyrrole was discovered and reported in 1963 (1), though
it was not until the independent discovery and report of electrically conducting polyacetylene
in 1977 that electrically conducting conjugated polymers (CPs) received wider attention (2).
Around roughly the same time, poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was found to be capable of dissolving
salts (3) and displaying significant ion conduction (4). Both systems were very quickly recognized
to have promise in electrochemical applications, and thus it was only a matter of time before
polymeric materials were purposefully designed to leverage both electronic and ionic conduction
simultaneously.
Polymer mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) were explicitly recognized and studied
beginning in the late 1980s as potential battery electrodes (5). Since then, a robust field of or-
ganic MIECs has emerged (6), among which polymeric MIECs are the most successful. As soft
solids, polymeric MIECs are mechanically, electrically, and chemically responsive in unique ways
compared to traditional inorganic MIECs (6). Today polymer mixed conductors have been em-
ployed in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEECs) (7), actuators (8), neuromorphic devices
(9), bioelectronics (10), organic electrochemical transistors (11), iontronics (12), thermoelectrics
(13), supercapacitors (14), battery electrodes (15), and electrochromics (16), to name a few. Poly-
meric MIECs are so broadly applicable due to ionic-electronic interactions that allow them to
store and transduce (ionic and electronic) charge and signals, respectively.
It is instructive to look to the more established fields of ionic transport in polymer electrolytes/
polyelectrolytes and electronic transport in doped organic semiconductors. However, the same
ionic-electronic interactions that make polymeric MIECs attractive complicate mixed transport.
The numerous insightful studies of mixed transport in polymers are spread across several decades
and multiple disciplines; thus, we draw important connections across the literature to assemble
a complete picture of the present body of knowledge of mixed transport in polymeric materials.
Here, we describe the ion and electronic transport in polymeric MIECs from the dry to gelled
state, with an emphasis on the deviations from the behavior of simple electronic or ionic conduc-
tors. Further, we highlight the unique synergetic effect on thermally driven charge transport.
2. IONIC TRANSPORT
The understanding of ionic transport in polymeric MIECs is dependent on the extensive work
done studying electrically insulating polymer electrolytes and polyelectrolytes (Figure 1a,b). In
particular, the following section draws heavily on some classic texts (17, 18) and excellent re-
cent reviews (19, 20). To survey ionic transport in polymeric MIECs, it is worthwhile to consider
what chemical functionality allows for ions to dissolve in polymers, what phenomena drive ionic
transport, the macromolecular motion that allows or facilitates said ionic transport, and various
compositional environments in which ionic transport in polymeric MIECs occurs.
2.1. Ion Solvation
For a polymer to conduct ions, it must be able to dissolve a salt (i.e., a reduction of the Gibbs
free energy of the salt dissolved in the polymer compared to the pure salt crystal). Poor solvation
in polymeric MIECs manifests on the device level as ion injection and transport barriers and
poor ionic-electronic coupling (e.g., charge storage or doping). In typical electrolytes, solvation
of ions arises by hydrogen bonding in protic, high-dielectric-constant electrolytes (e.g., water)
or by coordination to dipole containing functional groups in aprotic electrolytes (e.g., ether

oxygens in tetrahydrofuran) (Figure 2a,b). The most common solid polymer electrolytes lever-
age periodically repeating ether oxygen groups to coordinate and solvate cations (Figures 1a
and 2c), while anions are present but unsolvated. Alternatively, the polymer can be a component
of the salt itself, paired with charge-balancing counterions (Figures 1b and 2e), as in the case of
ionomers (<10% of the repeat units bear ionic charge) or polyelectrolytes (>10% of the repeat
units bear ionic charge). Typical examples of polymer electrolytes and polyelectrolytes are PEO
and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), respectively (Figure 1a,b).
Traditional CPs (Figure 1c,d) tend to have low dielectric constants,lack (a high density of) ion-
coordinating functional groups, and often contain long nonpolar alkyl side chains and thus do not
readily dissolve most salts. Polymeric MIECs overcome this via the incorporation of ionic charge
(polyelectrolytes) or coordinating groups (polymer electrolytes) (Figure 2d,f ). These groups can

be present as side chains of the polymer backbone, covalently linked blocks, or distinct polymer
electrolytes/polyelectrolytes that the CP has been composited with or templated on.This naturally
gives rise to six types of polymer mixed conductor: (I) CP/polyelectrolyte blends, (II) CP/polymer
electrolyte blends, (III) CP-b-polyelectrolyte block copolymers, (IV) CP-b-polymer electrolyte
block copolymers, (V) conjugated polyelectrolytes, and (VI) CP electrolytes (Figure 1) (6).
For polyelectrolyte MIECs (types I, III, and V), the tethered ionic charge requires counter-
balancing ions to maintain charge neutrality. Fixed ions are associated with oppositely charged
counterions producing ion pairs, and ion pairs are energetically predisposed to cluster and aggre-
gate (Figure 1e,f ) (21). In type VI conjugated polyelectrolytes, the ionic moieties are tethered via
side chains (often alkyl in nature) to a rigid conjugated backbone (Figures 1d and 2k–m). The
rigidity of the conjugated backbone and the energetic preference for π-π interchain interactions
limit the degree of aggregation/clustering. Generally, ionic aggregates are confined to the lamellar
spacing between π-stacked conjugated backbones (22–24).
Type II, IV, and VI polymer electrolyte MIECs most often employ (poly/oligo)ether chains,
blocks, and side chains, respectively. Ion solvation requires a sufficient number of coordination
sites, suitably spaced to allow chain conformation around the ion. In the linear polyethers, this
ideal spacing is two carbons between each ether oxygen, as found in PEO (Figure 1a). Al-
kali metal cations can reside in a PEO helix, coordinating with several ether oxygens (on av-
erage six in the case of Li+) (Figure 2c). Due to the low dielectric constant, these dissolved
ions are poorly screened and can also associate into multiple ion aggregates directly as contact
clusters or indirectly as solvent (chain) separated clusters. In PEO, anion coordination is neg-
ligible; as such, small halide ions are poorly soluble, while larger or polarizable anions (e.g.,
bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide) improve solubility (18).
In type I–IV polymeric MIECs (Figure 1e–i), conjugated and ionic/ion-coordinating macro-
molecular components tend to phase segregate into CP-rich domains and polyelectrolyte/polymer
electrolyte–rich domains, with ion dissolution occurring primarily in the latter. In type V and
VI polymeric MIECs (Figure 1j–p), ionic/ion-coordinating groups are evenly distributed along

the polymer and cannot naturally phase segregate. Due to phase segregation, type I–IV polymer
MIECs tend to present compositional heterogeneity on the tens to hundreds of nanometers length
scale, while length scale compositional heterogeneity in types V and VI is determined by the side
chain length (2–4 nm). Often polymeric MIECs are semicrystalline, and the relative distribution
of ions between the amorphous and crystalline domains is not known (25, 26).
In polymer mixed conductors, ions can also interact with electronic charge. Overall, elec-
tronic charge (holes or electrons) requires a counterbalancing dopant (anion or cation) to main-
tain charge balance. In polyelectrolyte MIECs (types I, III, and V), these can be some fraction of
the fixed ionic charge on the polyelectrolyte. In type II, IV, and VI polymer mixed conductors,
dopant ions are separately dissolved ionic species. Localized (trapped) electronic charge presents
as a discrete site for ionic-electronic coordination (27). Conversely, delocalized electronic charge
leads to a large increase in the dielectric constant (28) that works to screen particular ionic-ionic
and ionic-electronic associations. In phase-separated polymer mixed conductors (types I–IV), the
coordination between ionic and electronic charges can accumulate at the interface between the
polyelectrolyte/polymer electrolyte–rich domains and the CP-rich domains (29, 30).
2.2. Ion Drift and Diffusion
Ionic transport occurs in response to electric field (drift/migration) and concentration gradient
(diffusion) and, discounting convection, can be considered a summation of Ohm’s law and Fick’s
law. For dilute systems in one dimension, the current density ( Jionic) due to ionic transport can be
described as
Jionic = 

e |zi| niμi
d
dx + eziDi
dni
dx

,
where e is the elementary charge, ɸ is the potential, zi is the charge, ni is the number density, μi
is the mobility, and Di is the diffusion coefficient of each ionic species. It follows that σ ionic =
[e|zi|niμi] is the ionic conductivity. In dilute conditions, ni is easily convertible to the anion or
cation concentration (ci), and Di and μi are interconvertible with the Nernst-Einstein equation,
Di = RTμi,
where R is the gas constant. However, assumptions of infinite dilution do not hold in polymer
MIECs. Ion-ion interactions can produce neutral ion pairs (that can diffuse but do not migrate),
net charged ion triplets, and larger clusters or aggregates that can be neutral or charged. Thus, raw
anion and cation concentrations are not informative, and when known concentrations of each ion
and multi-ion species are absent, anion and cation thermodynamic activities should be used. Ad-
ditionally, depending on local pH, there may be non-negligible proton, hydronium, or hydroxide
transport in hydrated or aqueous systems.
Given this complexity, ionic transport in polymer MIECs is often quantified as simple σ ionic
or molar fluxes. When diffusion coefficients or mobilities are reported, they should be consid-
ered apparent or effective unless rigorously proven otherwise. In certain systems, it can be helpful
to consider ionic transport using Maxwell-Stefan diffusion (20) or in terms of an effective salt
diffusion coefficient and transference number (19).
While in typical electrolytes electroneutrality requires the local cation and anion concentra-
tions to be equal, this is not the case in polymeric MIECs, as holes or electrons can accumulate to
counterbalance excess anions or cations:
F  zici + enholes −enelectrons = 0,

where F is Faraday’s constant, ci is the individual ion concentrations, and n is the number density
of electrons or holes. Thus, ionic transport in polymer MIECs can give rise to independent anion
and cation concentration gradients (31), which are leveraged in LEECs (32).
2.3. Chain Motion
Solvated ion motion is necessarily coupled to the motion of the surrounding media. In liquid
electrolytes, the bulk solvent molecules are highly mobile and reorganize around the ion and its
solvation shell as they move together (i.e., vehicle transport), which manifests as a drag on ion
motion that is proportional to the electrolyte viscosity. In polymers, ionic transport is similarly
connected to motion of the surrounding macromolecules.
Except for low-molecular-weight oligomers, the solvating shell of coordination groups or ionic
moieties covalently bound to the polymer cannot transport with the ion (i.e., no vehicle transport).
Thus,the solvation shell is continually reforming as ions move between coordination sites through
local motion of the polymer chains. On short time and length scales, polymer segmental motion
can be described as an unentangled chain using the Rouse or Zimm model, while on longer time
and length scales, the motion of an entire entangled polymer chain can be described using the
reptation model (33). Uncoordinated ions (e.g., anions in PEO) still depend on chain motion to
move through the available free volume of the polymer. Due to this dependence on chain motion,
crystallinity is often detrimental to ionic transport.
When considering chain-coupled ion motion, it is instructive to consider the polymer persis-
tence length (ℓp), which describes the length below which the polymer acts like a rigid rod. For
example, ℓp for PEO is only 4 ˚A (Figure 1a) (33, 34); thus, a single chain can conform around
a cation and provide multiple sites for cation-ether oxygen coordination. Polystyrene has a ℓp ≈
7.3 ˚A (33), while PSS (Figure 1b) has a ℓp ≈12 ˚A (35), as the aggregation of ion pairs results in
longer rigid segments of polymer. The PEO ℓp is sufficiently short (i.e., the polymer is sufficiently
flexible) such that segmental motion occurs close to the scale of individual ion-coordinating ether
oxygens, allowing the cation to move while maintaining a highly coordinated solvation shell. PSS
chains are not so flexible as to allow the individual motion of coordinating sulfonate ions, but they
are flexible enough to bring neighboring ion aggregates in and out of close proximity with each
other, allowing ion hopping.
Polymeric MIECs contain a high degree of conjugation, imparting increased chain rigidity.
For example, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Figure 1c) in dilute solution displays
a ℓp of 29 ˚A, over seven times that of PEO (36). In the solid state, this increases to a ℓp of 49 ˚A
and 75 ˚A for amorphous and crystalline chains, respectively (37). Thus, conjugated chains are not
able to conform themselves to particular ions due to the limited local segmental motion to assist
ion motion. Fluctuations in the dihedral angle between repeat units [e.g., the ethylenedioxy rings
on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)] may impart some small ability for coordinating
sites to reorient in response to adjacent cations, particularly in amorphous domains (38, 39). As
with ion solvation, in phase-separated systems (types I–IV), segmental motion in the nonconju-
gated polyelectrolyte/polymer electrolyte–rich domains promotes ionic transport. For nominally
homogenous type V and VI polymer MIECs, the local motion of the ionic or ion-coordinating
side chains enables ion motion.
Because of the dependence of ionic transport on polymer motion, the temperature dependence
of σ ionic often follows the same functional dependence as the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT)
formulation of viscosity near a materials glass transition temperature, Tg (40),
σionic = σ0e
(
−B
R(T−T0) ).

While this is an empirical model, T0 is generally related to Tg by a constant offset. Below (18) and
far above (19) Tg, a simple Arrhenius relationship captures the temperature dependence of ionic
conductivity (41):
σionic = σ0e
 −Ea


,
where Ea is the activation energy of the ionic transport. In traditional CPs, the VFT relationship
must be modified to account for the applied potential and the solubility mismatch of ions with
CPs (42).
Despite the importance of thermal transitions in rationalizing ionic transport, the thermal
properties of polymeric MIECs are not fully understood. In conjugated polyelectrolytes (type V),
melt and glass transitions are counterion dependent (24). In type VI systems, thermal transitions
are often not observed, despite clear crystallinity as assessed by X-ray scattering. In random
copolymers of oligoethylene glycol and alkyl side chain monomers, an oligoethylene glycol
fraction of 5% is sufficient to suppress all measurable thermal transitions, despite significant
crystallinity being retained (43). In similar homopolymers, glass and multiple melt transitions
are apparent when a methyl group separates the polythiophene backbone and the first side
chain ether oxygen. Absent the methyl spacer, two glass transitions but no melting transitions
were observed, despite the polymers showing crystallinity via diffraction (44). It is possible that
the enthalpy of melting (ΔHm) is suppressed in these systems or that the Tm is shifted beyond
the degradation temperature.
2.4. Ionic Transport Environments
There are four general ionic transport conditions to consider: dry, hydrated, swollen by a
contacting liquid electrolyte, and (hydro)gelled (Figure 3). These conditions arise from varied
applications of polymeric MIECs, and each case presents unique characteristics that influence
ionic transport.
2.4.1.
Dry ionic transport. The dry condition consists simply of the mixed conducting
polymer and dissolved ions, lacking liquid solvent molecules from ambient vapor or a contacting

In the dry state, ion transport is wholly dependent on chain motion. Ambient solvent vapor or moisture can solvate ions and lead to
significant swelling, which enhances ion transport. Contact with liquid electrolytes increases these effects. In the extreme case, such as a
hydrogel, ion transport is essentially equivalent to that in a liquid electrolyte.

liquid electrode. These can be closed systems with a fixed total composition (e.g., LEECs)
or open systems in contact with any ion sink/source (e.g., a solid polymer electrolyte) with a
dynamic total composition (e.g., solid-state battery electrodes). In both cases, ionic transport
is dependent on chain fluctuations, and extended conjugation is detrimental to ionic transport.
Microphase-separated materials with flexible nonconjugated chains or blocks show the highest
dry σ ionic (40, 45–47). In type IV P3HT-b-PEO (Figure 1i), σ ionic of ∼5 × 10−4 S/cm at 90°C
is on par with pure PEO when normalized by ether oxygen content (40, 46, 47), indicating good
connectivity between ion-coordinating sites (48). The type VI conjugated homopolymer elec-
trolyte poly[3-oligo(oxyethylene)-4-methylthiophene] (P350MT) (Figure 1o) with oligoethylene
glycol side chains displays a decreased σ ionic of 4 × 10−5 S/cm at similar temperatures due to
decreased segmental motion from extended backbone rigidity (49), which likely manifests as a
loss of coordination site connectivity (48).
Ion coordination pins chains, decreasing their fluctuations and increasing Tg with increasing
ion concentration. For example, the Tg of P350MT (type VI) (Figure 1o) increases ∼90°C from
neat to a salt loading of 0.35 cations per side chain ether oxygen (49). In addition, ion-ion inter-
actions lead to a negative dependence of ion mobility on ion concentration. These compounding
effects cause σ ionic to rise with initial addition of salt, peak below 0.1 cation per ether oxygen, and
decrease with additional salt in type II and VI polymeric MIECs (Figure 4a) (44, 45, 49) similar
to PEO (19).
In the dry state, type VI conjugated polyelectrolyte MIECs (Figure 1j–l) display very low σ ionic
(∼10−11 S/cm) (41, 50–52), as strong ion-ion interactions leave only ∼0.1% of ions mobile (51),
and the limited segmental motion due to conjugated backbone rigidity requires long hops between
aggregates with large activation energies (0.8–1.6 eV) (41, 50, 51). Tripling the ion-containing side
chain density on polyfluorene-based conjugated polyelectrolytes (Figure 1j) halves the activation
energy and increases σ ionic by an order of magnitude (∼10−10 S/cm) (51), presumably due to both
an increase in mobile ions and a decrease in hopping distance between ion aggregates.
In electrically insulating polymer electrolytes, nonvolatile additives (crown ethers, tetraglyme,
ionic liquids, etc.) have been shown to improve ionic transport by plasticizing the polymers (53),
and creating a mobile solvation shell, à la vehicle transport. Initial studies of polymeric MIECs
with ionic liquids (54, 55), sorbitol (56, 57), and crown ethers (58) have been promising.
2.4.2. Hydrated ionic transport. Hydration has a tremendous effect on ionic transport in poly-
mer mixed conductors. Many polymer MIECs (especially types I, III, and V) show such low σ ionic
in the dry state that they can be considered as simply electrical (semi)conductors due to strong
ion association with the polymer and limited chain motion. With hydration, water plasticizes
chains, increasing chain motion, and begins to solvate the ions, partially displacing the polymer in
the cation solvation shell (27). In conjugated polyelectrolytes, water dissociates the counterion. A
sufficient degree of hydration produces a mobile solvation shell of water, allowing vehicle trans-
port. At room temperature, the σ ionic of conjugated polyelectrolytes (type VI) spans seven to eight
orders of magnitude depending on the degree of hydration (Figure 4b) (41, 52). PEDOT:PSS
(type I) also shows similarly large increases in σ ionic with increased hydration, and the degree of
hydration in both can be quite large, 70–90 wt% at 90% relative humidity (RH) (52). At high
levels of hydration, temperature-dependent σ ionic deviates from VFT or Arrhenius behavior (41).
The σ ionic of type I materials with high water content is quite high (10−3–10−2 S/cm) (Figure 5)
(41, 52, 59–61). These conductivities approach those of the equivalent aqueous electrolytes. As
many polymeric MIECs incorporate poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSH), parallel proton trans-
port via the Grotthuss mechanism likely becomes significant in the highly hydrated state (62).

2.4.3. Electrolyte swollen ionic transport. Many applications require polymeric MIECs to
be in contact with liquid electrolytes (10, 11, 14, 16). This complicates the description of trans-
port, as ions and solvent are now in a concentration- and electrochemical potential–dependent
equilibrium between the contacting liquid electrolyte and polymer MIEC (63). This is most
obvious in potential-dependent swelling of polymeric MIECs in response to electrochemi-
cally induced electronic charge. In this environment, many marginal polymeric MIECs that

Ionic and electronic conductivity map of various types of polymeric mixed ionic-electronic conductors
under dry, hydrated, electrolyte swollen, and gelled conditions. The degree of doping and hydration
leads to a several orders of magnitude range of electronic and ionic conductivity, respectively.
Dry polymer electrolyte-based materials (types II, IV, and VI) show much better ionic conductivity than dry
polyelectrolyte-based materials (type V). However, hydrated and solvent swollen polyelectrolyte/conjugated
polymer composites (type I) show both the best ionic and electronic conductivity. Abbreviations:

minimally solvate/transport ions become surprisingly effective mixed conductors. As an example,
the type VI material poly(2-(3,3′-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)-[2,2′-bithiophen]-
5-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) [p(g2T-TT)] passively swells only ∼10% when in contact with
aqueous NaCl, independent of electrolyte concentration. However, upon the application of an
oxidizing potential, p(g2T-TT) reversibly swells an additional 42% to 86% (63). This exemplifies
the important contribution of electronic charge in ion solvation and coordination. In a similar ma-
terial with roughly double the density of oligoethylene glycol side chains, the reversible swelling
in response to electrochemical potential is increased to ∼300% and can exceed 1,000%, though ir-
reversibly (64). This electrochemical potential–dependent polymeric MIEC swelling is intuitively
expected to lead to large changes in σ ionic,though this has yet to be directly experimentally verified.
In traditional hydrophobic CPs, electrochemical potential–dependent swelling manifests as
voltage-switchable semiconductor to mixed conductor behavior. In the neutral state (absence
of electronic charge), hydrophobic CPs do not dissolve ions or water; however, once electronic
charge is present, it is energetically favorable (required) that dopant ions are present and thus
the film swells with electrolytes. The electrochemical potential necessary for this to occur is
not simply connected to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the CP; it
includes an ion-dependent overpotential (65) that increases with decreasing ion polarizability
and is inversely proportional with ion miscibility in the CP (42). In true MIEC polymers that

are sufficiently able to solvate ions, this overpotential is effectively zero, and the onset of electro-
chemical potential–dependent swelling tracks with HOMO/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) level positions.
Peculiarly, the rigid backbone ladder (BBL) polymer (Figure 1d) passively swells ∼10% when
in contact with an aqueous electrolyte and swells ∼100% upon application of a reductive potential
with little apparent overpotential (66). This is quite unexpected due to the low density of ion
coordination sites (carbonyl groups), and the large ℓp of BBL (∼1,530 ˚A) (67) would imply the
inability of local segmental motion to assist ionic transport. BBL may have sufficient free volume
to allow ion and water penetration, and due to its rigidity it may form a unique rigid rod gel
network, allowing a high degree of swelling; however, this phenomenon deserves further study.
As with highly hydrated systems, polyelectrolyte-based MIECs in contact with liquid elec-
trolytes display facile ionic transport. Across a variety of ions, PEDOT:PSS σ ionic shows the same
concentration dependence as liquid electrolytes (68). PEDOT:PSS moving front experiments re-
vealed ion mobilities on par with aqueous electrophoretic mobilities (69). As excessive swelling can
be detrimental to device stability, cross-linkers are often employed to decrease polymeric MIEC
swelling. In cross-linked PEDOT:PSS, the ionic mobility was decreased by an order of magnitude,
in keeping with the expected swelling-conductivity relationship (69).
Type I polymeric MIECs incorporating proton-conducting ionomers in acidic electrolytes
reach very high σ ionic values (10−2–10−1 S/cm) (Figure 5), almost assuredly due to Grotthuss
transport of protons through a hydrogen-bonded network (70, 71). In PEDOT templated on sul-
fonated poly(2,6-dimethyl 1,4-phenylene oxide), the proton hopping activation energy in 1 M
sulfuric acid (34–72 meV) was over 20 times lower than the activation energy of chain-dependent
hopping in dry polyelectrolyte-based MIECs. Highlighting the effect of the Grotthuss mecha-
nism, in the same material, Li+ conductivity was one-tenth that of protons (71).
Many studies assume single ion transport between the MIEC and liquid electrolytes. Any ad-
ditional mass transport has been ascribed to solvent transport. In the case of polyelectrolyte-based
MIECs (types I, III, and V), this assumption is likely true, as Donnan exclusion arising from the
fixed polyelectrolyte charge should prevent transport of ions of the same charge as the polyelec-
trolyte. However, in polymer electrolyte–based MIECs (types II, IV, and VI), there is neither fixed
ionic charge nor Donnan exclusion. Both anions and cations are in equilibrium between the liquid
electrolyte and the MIEC, and single ion transport is at odds with experimental observations of
dopant and counterion uptake (72–74).
2.4.4. Hydrogel ionic transport. Both highly hydrated and electrolyte swollen polymeric
MIECs are more accurately described as conductive hydrogels, which is an area of explicit re-
search (75–78). In such hydrogels, ionic transport is decoupled from polymer chain dynamics, as
continuous liquid pathways are available for ionic transport. Thus, engineering high σ ionic is un-
necessary; instead, maintaining a percolative path for effective electronic transport is the main
design goal, as discussed in Section 3.6. Separately engineering the electronic transport pathways
while maintaining liquid (void) spaces spanning the nano- to mesoscale leads to considerable over-
lap between MIEC hydrogels and structured porous materials (77).

IONIC-ELECTRONIC CONDUCTORS
Of the extensive body of work studying electronic transport in CPs, the most insightful paral-
lels to transport in polymeric MIECs can be drawn from studies of molecular and electrochemi-

RADICAL POLYMERS
As the name suggests, radical polymers can stabilize electronic charge not through conjugation and delocalization,
but through stable open-shell moieties, i.e., radicals. These radicals can couple with ions in a similar manner as
electrochemical doping in CP-based MIECs (73), and their mixed conducting properties have made them attrac-
tive materials for battery electrodes (79). Ionic transport occurs in the same chain motion–dependent manner as
traditional polymer electrolytes. Radicals are often localized to pendant groups, and electronic transport occurs
through self-exchange between pendant groups that are brought into close proximity via chain motion (80). In
contrast to CPs, radical polymers do not require a rigid backbone for electronic transport. Instead, the same chain
motion that imparts ionic conductivity also imparts electronic conductivity, with both showing a strong dependence
on Tg (81).
dopants are ions and tend to electrostatically stabilize electronic charge. Though both can occur
in polymeric MIECs, electrochemical doping is especially important to consider due to the high
ion concentrations present. While the focus on CP-based systems reflects the state of the field,
not all polymer MIECs are conjugated (see the sidebar titled Radical Polymers).
3.1. The Nature of Electronic Carriers
Just as ionic transport in polymeric MIECs requires the appropriate chemical functionality to
solvate ions, electronic transport requires the proper electronic structure to stabilize mobile elec-
tronic charge carriers. This requisite electronic structure is most commonly achieved through
extended conjugation that creates delocalized π-orbitals. Electronic carriers can be induced by
adding an electron (reduction) or removing an electron to create a positively charged hole (oxida-
tion). Following the nomenclature of semiconductors, polymeric MIECs that are readily oxidized
and reduced are referred to as p- and n-type materials, respectively, while those that undergo both
are referred to as ambipolar.
While anions and cations in close proximity can form neutral pairs, unless the energetics are
precisely engineered (82), an electron and hole in close proximity tend to recombine, annihilating
both. Thus, it is unlikely to have areas of both sustained electron and hole concentration. Instead,
recombination zones form at the interface of n- and p-type regions, as exploited in LEECs (32).
The relative ease with which an electronic carrier can be induced by molecular or electrochem-
ical doping is directly related to the polymeric MIEC molecular orbitals’ energy level positions.
To induce an electron, the LUMO must be sufficiently deep, or to induce a hole, the HOMO
must be sufficiently shallow to be within accessible potentials for the given electrolyte system. For
systems containing water, this range is ∼4.0 to ∼5.4 eV deep on the vacuum scale (83, 84).
Unlike crystalline inorganic materials in which electronic charge carriers are nearly completely
delocalized and interact little with the materials crystalline lattice, electronic carriers in polymeric
MIECs are closely coupled to local structural deformations. It is useful to treat the electronic
charge and coupled lattice deformation as a single quasiparticle termed a polaron. Polarons them-
selves can combine into large quasiparticles to form bipolarons and multipolaronic/bipolaronic
species (85).
Electroneutrality dictates that oppositely charged ions balance electronic carriers. The fixed
polyelectrolyte charge in type I/III/V materials can serve this function, while type II/IV/VI ma-
terials require the injection of counterbalancing dopant anions or cations. Alternatively, elec-
tronic carriers can be introduced into polymeric MIECs through molecular doping with molecules
that favorably undergo charge transfer with polymeric MIECs. The same chemical functionality

that allows polymeric MIECs to solvate ions has also been found to improve molecular doping
efficiency (86, 87).
3.2. Mechanism of Electronic Transport
As with ions, electrons and holes move in response to applied field and concentration gradients.
The drift-diffusion equation in one dimension gives the current density (Jn) for electrons,
Jn = enμn
dφ
dx + eDn
dn
dx ,
and the current density (Jp) for holes,
Jp = epμp
dφ
dx −eDp
dp
dx,
where n and p are the number densities,μn and μp are mobilities,and Dn and Dp are the diffusivities
for the electrons and holes, respectively. Thus, the n- and p-type electrical conductivities are given
as σ n = enμn and σ p = epμp, respectively. Absent molecular doping, n and p are equal to the excess
cation and anion concentrations, respectively. This is especially relevant in polymeric MIECs that
are coupled with an external electrolyte and are under potentiostatic control.
Electronic charge transport in doped CPs is often described as Efros–Shklovskii variable-range
hopping (28, 88, 89), in which the electronic conductivity (σ electronic) has the following temperature
dependence:
σelectronic = σESe

TES
T
−1
2
,
where σ ES is the conductivity prefactor and TES is the characteristic temperature.The fundamental
insight of this model is the presence of a Coulomb gap in the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi
level. The Coulomb gap can be qualitatively rationalized as the energetic distance between the
highest filled localized states (Fermi level) and the lowest empty delocalized states (transport level
or mobility edge) (see inset in Figure 6a). Increasing the charge density should decrease TES
such that at or above TES, the thermal energy should be sufficient to collapse the Coulomb gap,
resulting in high (metallic) conductivity (28). However, this has not been unequivocally achieved
(90), likely due to dopant-induced disorder that accompanies high carrier densities (28).
Over smaller temperature ranges, electronic mobility is commonly (if not strictly accurately)
described as thermally activated hopping with an Arrhenius relationship:
μ = μ0e
 −Ea
RT

,
where the activation energy (Ea) and exponential prefactor (μ0) are carrier density dependent. The
activation energy is a useful parameter to approximate the difference between the Fermi level and
transport level to compare the mobility at different carrier densities and in different materials
(91, 92).
Efficient electronic transport in polymeric MIECs depends on particular characteristics on dif-
ferent length scales. On the shortest length scale, the degree of carrier localization is paramount.
Decreased localization leads to lower activation energies and higher mobilities. Localization de-
pends intrinsically on the chemical and molecular structure and extrinsically on the proximity
of ions. Carriers can be localized to a particular repeat subunit due to its electron-accepting or
-donating character. Alternatively, large dihedral angles between repeat units can limit delocaliza-
tion of charge to single (or few) repeat units. A classic CP example is regiorandom P3HT, in which

are the lower and upper transport levels, respectively. The broadening of the density of states distribution with increased doping drives

the steric hindrance of side chains in head-to-head coupled thiophenes introduces significant tor-
sion, decreasing the conjugation length and localizing charge, which widens the optical bandgap
and decreases σ electronic (93, 94). In comparison, all head-to-tail coupled regioregular P3HT lacks
this torsion and shows charge delocalization over 10 repeat units (95). This is reflected in the ℓp
of regiorandom (∼10 ˚A) and regioregular (∼29 ˚A) P3HT (36). When localization is the limiting
factor, it leads to mixed valence redox transport in which σ electronic maximums are observed in the
half-charged states (96). However, in most polymeric MIECs, localization is not so extreme and
is one of several factors that affect electronic transport.
On longer length scales, intrachain, interchain, and interdomain transport sum to produce
macroscopic percolated electronic transport pathways. Low disorder (low torsion) that decreases
carrier localization also improves transport down the chain backbone (intrachain transport).
Planarity can be enhanced by backbone design or through intermolecular interactions (aggre-
gation or crystallinity). Inherently planar backbones with fused rings or chemical functionality
that limit torsion at single bond linkages (e.g., BBL, ℓp ∼1,530 ˚A) display low energetic disorder,

independent of molecular packing (67, 97). In aggregates and crystallites, intermolecular interac-
tions can force otherwise somewhat flexible chains into more ordered extended planar structures,
more than doubling their ℓp values (37) and extending charge carrier delocalization along the
chain and onto neighboring chains (98), allowing efficient interchain transport. The extent of
ordering can be just a few chains aggregated together up to crystallites hundreds of nanometers in
diameter,with increased aggregation or crystallinity generally correlated with improved electronic
transport. Within the limit of very rigid planar polymers, the minimum requisite aggregation for
efficient interchain transport can be single close contacts between two chains (99).
The intermolecular aggregation or crystallinity that allows efficient interchain transport also
produces discrete boundaries between crystallites and between crystalline and amorphous do-
mains. Interdomain transport is impeded by the boundaries themselves and the high disorder of
the amorphous regions (90). Doped CPs that show completely delocalized (metallic) carriers in
ordered domains still display thermally activated macroscopic transport due to these boundaries
and amorphous regions (89). The effect of boundaries is minimized in films of highly rigid chains
or aligned domains in which boundaries are gradual and low angle (99, 100). Still, traversing the
amorphous regions between crystallites requires individual connecting tie chains between crystal-
lites or aggregates (Figure 6b), resulting in a positive correlation between electronic transport and
molecular weight, as longer chains more often bridge crystallites (101, 102). This is exemplified
in oligomeric MIECs that show much lower σ electronic than similar polymeric analogs (103, 104).
3.3. Effect of Ions on Electronic Transport
Ions complicate electronic transport. At low concentrations, ions present deep Coulomb wells that
localize (trap) carriers and decrease their mobility (Figure 6a) (94, 105, 106), such that the carrier
mobility in electrochemically doped devices is over an order of magnitude lower than that in field
effect devices at equivalent volumetric charge carrier density (91). Above ∼0.1% doping (1 dopant
ion per 1,000 repeat units), electronic mobilities dramatically increase with increased dopant con-
centration as the tail of the DOS fills (Figure 6a) (106), and Coulomb wells overlap, smoothing
the energy landscape and reducing the hopping activation energy (92). This is reflected in an in-
creased dielectric constant screening ions and carriers and increased carrier localization lengths
(28). High doping levels (∼10%) lead to high mobilities [0.1–10 cm2/(V·s)] and σ electronic (10–
1,000 S/cm) (88, 92, 107, 108), with hopping activation energies equivalent to the thermal energy
(kbT) at room temperature (91, 92). Above 10% doping, σ electronic improvements diminish, with
mobility plateauing as the cumulative disorder that accompanies doping flattens the DOS and de-
creases the number of delocalized transport states (see inset in Figure 6a) (28). At extreme doping
levels, disorder is so great that carrier mobility is suppressed and σ electronic is extinguished (92).
3.4. Dry Electronic Transport
In dry type V materials, while total ion concentrations are high, the dopant concentration (excess
anion or cation) is well below 1% (51), and carrier mobility is quite low [∼10−5 cm2/(V·s)]
(Figure 5) (109). Type IV materials with balanced anion and cation concentrations also show
quite low σ electronic (10−8–10−7 S/cm) (Figure 5) but can be increased approximately five orders
of magnitude by introducing excess dopant anions. Further, the dopant-conductivity relationship
is not simply linear, as a 10-fold increase in dopants yields a 100-fold increase in σ electronic (110).
PEDOT:PSS (type I) is inherently highly doped (∼30%) by the PSS−on which it is templated.
Additives or processing that remove superfluous PSS, improve domain purity, and create a
well-percolated network of PEDOT-rich domains yield σ electronic > 1,000 S/cm (Figure 5) (88,
107, 111).

3.5. Hydrated and Electrolyte Swollen Electronic Transport
In undoped CPs, water acts as an electronic trap, diminishing electronic transport, and the dis-
placement of water molecules from CP films drastically improves the electronic properties (112).
Polymeric MIECs’ high carrier densities can saturate such traps, and their coordinating groups
can potentially interact with water without creating traps, as they display high σ electronic in aque-
ous environments. The intrinsic and molecular doped σ electronic of conjugated polyelectrolytes
(type V) is relatively insensitive to hydration (41, 52, 60). Similarly, high σ electronic formulations of
PEDOT:PSS (type I) are insensitive to hydration (60), while low σ electronic formulations show only
a factor of 3 decrease in σ electronic at 100% RH (59).
When polymeric MIECs are in contact with a liquid electrolyte, the dopant density is directly
tunable with electrochemical potential, making them prime channel materials for organic electro-
chemical transistors (11, 113–116). The massive change in σ electronic with charge density permits
high transconductance (gain), quantified by the intrinsic material figure of merit μC∗, the product
of the charge carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance (reflecting the DOS) (117, 118).
The equilibrium between polymeric MIECs and liquid electrolytes leads to a strong dopant
density dependence on electrolyte concentration and pH, in addition to electrochemical potential
(63, 119, 120). The σ electronic of PEDOT:PSS is enhanced in acidic conditions, while increasing the
pH decreases doping and increases in cation exchange, with sodium cations supplanting protons
and preferentially associating with PSS−(at the expense of holes on PEDOT) (121). This is re-
flected in PEDOT templated on poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) sodium salt (PSSNa), which displays
quite low σ electronic that is very sensitive to hydration (52, 60).
Interdomain transport can be physically disrupted by the swelling that accompanies hydration
and electrolyte exposure (52, 63, 64, 122). Monitoring crystallinity with in situ and ex situ X-ray
scattering indicates that the bulk of the swelling must occur in the amorphous domains (26, 63,
123).Electronic transport should be especially sensitive to tie chains or domain contacts that create
percolated pathways (Figure 6b). In CP electrolytes (type VI), some swelling is necessary to facil-
itate dopant ion injection, but excessive swelling leads to decreases in carrier mobility (124–126).
3.6. Hydrogel Electronic Transport
When highly swollen, polymer MIECs are functionally hydrogels. Typically, σ electronic is low, such
that σ electronic approaching 10 S/cm is considered ultrahigh (77, 127–129), reflecting the loss of
percolation with swelling. σ electronic is inversely proportional to the degree of swelling in both
PEDOT:PSS poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(acrylic acid) double-network and PEDOT:PSS single-
component hydrogels (78, 130). Ions further disrupt percolation (likely screening electrostatic
interactions between aggregates), as gelation with phosphate-buffered saline reduces σ electronic
by 50% compared to gelation with water (78). Rheological analysis is common to hydrogel
characterization (129), and given the expected connections between the percolated electronic and
mechanical networks, combined rheological and electrical analysis is a promising avenue of
study (131).
4. IONIC VERSUS ELECTRONIC TRANSPORT
On the surface, the structural characteristics of efficient electronic transport (rigid chains,
semicrystalline structure) seem at odds with characteristics of efficient ionic transport (flexible
chains, amorphous structure). This holds true for homogenous polymeric MIECs (types V and
VI), in which the same backbone must impart electronic and ionic transporting characteris-
tics and mixed transport requires a compromise of individual ionic and electronic transport
88

(41, 49, 52, 132). Further, swelling that increases ionic transport strains the percolated pathway
of electronic transport. However, such compromises are largely sidestepped by separating the
ionic and electronic transport into separate domains (types I, II, III, and IV). Dry type IV block
copolymers show independently tuned ionic (via salt concentration) and electronic (via degree
of oxidation) transport (Figure 5) (40, 47). Control of PEDOT:PSS (type IV) morphology and
hydration allows simultaneous high ionic and electronic conductivity (60, 61, 69, 71), with a
100-fold increase in electronic conductivity diminishing ion diffusivities by a factor of only two
(107). For context, it is worth remembering that some of the highest electrical conductivities in
polymers occur in mixed conducting materials (88, 111). Further, simply maximizing both is not
the universal goal in polymer MIEC-based applications; instead, it is the rational control of ionic
and electronic transport. For instance, increased ionic transport leads to faster response times
in LEECs (58); conversely, decreased ionic transport leads to faster response times in organic
light-emitting diodes (133), and restraining ionic transport imparts nonvolatility in synaptic-like
devices (134). Given the wide variety of polymeric MIECs, there is likely to be a proper balance
of mixed conducting properties to satisfy most applications.
5. HEAT AND ENERGY TRANSPORT IN POLYMERIC MIXED
IONIC-ELECTRONIC CONDUCTORS
In addition to drift and diffusion, thermal gradients drive the transport (thermodiffusion) of both
ionic and electronic charges. Moreover, mobile charge opens additional routes for heat transport.
Thus, polymeric MIECs show unique thermodiffusion and thermal transport compared to pure
electronically or ionically conducting polymers.
5.1. Seebeck Coefficient
An applied thermal gradient (ΔT) drives thermodiffusion of charge carriers from the hot to the
cold (high to low entropy) ends, establishing a steady-state thermovoltage (ΔV). Known as the
Seebeck effect, the proportionality constant between ΔV and ΔT is the Seebeck coefficient (S =
–ΔV/ΔT). Also known as thermopower, S is the entropy transported by a carrier divided by its
charge and represents a sum of contributions of the different charge carriers and their transport.
For predominantly electronic conductors (e.g., PEDOT:tosylate), ΔV increases with increasing
ΔT until saturating at a few tens or hundreds of microvolts per Kelvin (97, 136, 137). Electronic
carriers thermodiffuse quickly, and the response of ΔV to ΔT is relatively fast (Figure 7a) (138).
Conversely, in pure ionic conductors (e.g., PSSNa), ΔV is slow to reach steady state as ions
thermodiffuse slowly due to the Soret effect. If only cations are mobile, as in the case of PSSNa,
they will thermodiffuse faster than the immobile anions, accumulating at the cold end of the
electrode. The resulting positive ΔV (∼10 mV/K) is 1,000× that of pure electronic conductors
(139–141) and varies with ambient RH (60), as hydration enhances the thermodiffusion of the
cations (Figure 7a).
In polymeric MIECs (e.g., PEDOT:PSS), the evolution of ΔV with ΔT is the result of two
competing effects: ionic versus electronic thermodiffusion. Initially, cations accumulate at the cold
end, and ΔV increases steadily as ΔT increases, reaching a maximum value of 0.1–1 mV/K de-
pending on RH. This ionic transport changes the doping level locally throughout the sample
(138), causing electronic and ionic carriers to redistribute to ensure electroneutrality. This is ac-
companied by a decrease in ΔV to ∼5–10 μV/K, equivalent to the pure electronic contribution to
ΔV (Figure 7a). Unlike the ionic contribution, the electronic contribution to ΔV is independent
of the relative humidity (60). Because of its transient nature, this ionic Seebeck effect in MIECs

does not contribute to power generation, but it can be exploited for simultaneous independent
pressure-humidity-temperature sensing (141).
Mobile electrochemically active redox species and reactive electrodes allow continual thermo-
generated ionic currents and constant power generation in polymeric MIECs. Ag+ electrochemi-
cally reacting with silver metal electrodes in PEDOT:Ag:PSS gives rise to a thermogalvanic effect
(59). Holes are transported in the PEDOT-rich regions, while cations (Ag+ and/or protons) ther-
modiffuse preferentially within the PSS-rich domains, generating an extra constant current on
top of the nonconstant ionic Seebeck effect. The addition of pure ionic conductors like PSSH to
polymeric MIECs results in hydrogels that are able to maintain the hydration necessary for ef-
fective ionic transport under ambient conditions, yielding stable thermopowers >15 mV/K (142).
The sign of the Seebeck coefficient can also be reversed from positive (mobile cations) to negative
(mobile anions) by tailoring the ion/polymer matrix interaction (143, 144).
S and σ electronic of pure electronic conductors are interrelated as a function of the charge carrier
concentration (i.e., S decreases as σ increases). This behavior is typically rationalized in terms
of the energy of the carrier with respect to the chemical potential of the material. Upon doping,
an increase in charge carrier concentration drives the Fermi level closer to the transport level,
such that the energy per carrier decreases. An empirical power law relationship between S and
σ electronic (i.e., S ∝σ electronic–¼) has been observed across a broad range of σ electronic for different
pure electronic conductors (Figure 7b) (145). While the origin of this quasiuniversal trend is yet
to be understood, it is typically attributed to inhomogeneity in the polymeric film morphology
(146) or to energetic disorder due to the presence of ionized dopants (147). Structural anisotropy
in crystalline polymers can induce both S and σ electronic to increase simultaneously (148), yield-
ing power factor values (Sσ 2) that go beyond those predicted by the empirical power law
relationship.
Polymeric pure ionic conductors do not typically follow this quasiuniversal trend (Figure 7b).
In polymeric ion gels, the σ ionic increases with increasing ionic liquid content, while the ionic

Seebeck coefficient remains constant (143). In PSS, increased hydration increases the cation mo-
bility (anions are immobile in PSS), without varying the ion concentration (149), simultaneously
increasing both S and σ ionic, leading to an S versus σ relationship orthogonal to that of pure elec-
tronic conductors. A similar trend was reported for polymeric MIECs, in which conductivity is
primarily dominated by humidity-independent electronic transport, while the Seebeck coefficient
is largely dominated by humidity-dependent ionic thermodiffusion (Figure 7b) (60).
5.2. Thermal Conductivity
In electronic conductors, phonons and electrons contribute to heat transport, and the resulting
thermal conductivity (κ) has a lattice (κL) and electronic (κel) component, such that κ = κL + κel. κel
and σ electronic are related by the Wiedemann-Franz law, κel = LTσ electronic, where L is the Lorentz
number. In CPs, κel is typically 0.1–0.5 W/(m·K), with κel becoming significant when σ electronic
exceeds 10 S/cm (151). As heat transport is more efficient through covalent bonding along the
chain direction than through van der Waals interactions between chains, amorphous and ordered
regions have different contributions to κ. In PEDOT:PSS, anisotropic phase separation results
in anisotropic κ (152), with fast in-plane heat transport through interconnected (high σ electronic)
PEDOT-rich domains and slower PSS-limited heat transport out of plane (Figure 8a) (153). This
anisotropy vanishes with increased PSS loading, and κ approaches that of pure PSS as in-plane
σ electronic decreases and heat transport is limited by PSS in all directions (Figure 8b) (150).
Polyelectrolytes display a hydration-dependent κ. In PSSNa, κ increases from 0.35 to
0.49 W/(m·K), when RH is increased from 50% to 100% (149). This rise is explained as
the formation of parallel polymer-rich and aqueous-rich paths of thermal transport [κH2O =
0.6 W/(m·K) at room temperature]. Similar trends are reasonably expected in hydrated polymeric
MIECs. Hydration should affect κL but not κel, as σ electronic is independent of hydration and σ ionic
is typically less than 10−2 S/cm (60). To a first approximation, the thermal conductivity should
be a composition-weighted average of the lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity of
the solvent and of the conducting polymer. However, the empirical results are more complicated

with high and low σ electronic PEDOT:PSS showing opposite trends in κ with hydration (154). This
complex behavior calls for a better understanding of thermal transport in polymeric MIECs.
6. CONCLUSION
There is a growing body of work studying mixed ionic and electronic transport in polymeric ma-
terials. Mixed ionic and electronic transport in polymers requires proper chemical functionality
to solvate ions and stabilize electrons and/or holes. Ionic transport depends on chain motion,
while electronic transport depends on intermolecular interactions and macroscopic percolation.
This can be achieved with a variety of polymer blends, block copolymers, and homopolymers,
each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The varied applications of polymeric MIECs
require vastly different operating environments (dry, hydrated, electrolyte swollen, etc.), which
leads to the same material displaying drastically different mixed conducting properties depending
on environment. However, proper choice of polymer MIECs can provide efficient mixed trans-
port irrespective of application environment. Studies thus far have focused on a limited range of
materials (mostly PEDOT:PSS based), and quantitative reports of ionic transport are for the most
part limited to type I and IV polymeric MIECs. Expansion of ionic transport studies to a wider
range of polymeric MIECs is needed. Investigations of additives for increased ionic transport in
dry materials are currently lacking. Low disorder planar CP electrolytes and polyelectrolytes have
tantalizing potential for improved electronic charge transport. Polymeric MIECs are uniquely
capable of simultaneously containing and transporting very high ionic and electronic charge
carrier densities, and the coupling between these high ionic and electronic charge densities lies
at the heart of their unique functionality. Better understanding of these ionic-electronic coupling
properties is the key to advancing new applications. Interest in polymeric MIECs is spread across
many fields, and improving mixed transport in particular polymeric MIEC types and applications
requires leveraging the collective knowledge across disciplines. Further progress across these
fronts will improve the feasibility of polymeric MIECs in the many current areas of interest and
open new application areas for these exciting materials.
