Neuromorphic systems that display synaptic conditioning based on
biochemical signaling activity have recently been introduced in the form of
artiﬁcial synapses that are model devices to develop tissue-interfaced
platforms. In this regard, biohybrid synapses promise adaptive
neuron-integrated functions. However, these systems suﬀer from both
molecular cross-talk as biological neural circuits signal transmission typically
involves more than one neuromodulator, and unstable electronics wirings as
complex architectures are required to interface the tissues. Moreover, whilst
novel spiking circuits can work as artiﬁcial neurons, they only recreate the
biological electrical signaling pathway while electrochemical signal
transduction is required for inter-neuron communication. As such, artiﬁcial
chemically-mediated synapses are essential to perform memory/learning
computing functions. Herein, an electrochemical neuromorphic organic
device (ENODe) working as an artiﬁcial synapse that overcomes
electrochemical and readout interferences while it emulates two
neurotransmitters synaptic weight modulation and their recycling machinery
at the synaptic cleft is shown. Neuronal short- and long-term plasticity are
replicated by transducing two separate neurotransmitter-mediated chemical
signals into reversible and nonreversible variations of PEDOT:PSS
conductance. By exploiting the electrochromic properties of PEDOT:PSS, an
alternative optical monitoring strategy is introduced which promises stable
multidevice readout from complex bio-hybrid interfaces. The platform
emulates high-order biological processes such as intrinsic forgetting, memory
consolidation, and neurotransmitter co-modulation. These brain-inspired
functionalities herald the development of tissue-integrated neuromorphic
systems that combine spiking (electrical neurons) and nonspiking
(electrochemical synapses) elements, thus envisioning prosthetic bridges for
neural engineering and regenerative medicine.

1. Introduction
Artiﬁcial intelligence applications often
require neural networks featuring highly
demanding computational density and
energy consumption.[1,2] As a response
to these technological challenges, neu-
romorphic computing aims to emulate
the structure and functions of the brain,
in order to outperform conventional
von Neumann architectures. On this ac-
count, spiking neural networks (SNNs)
introduce a spikes-based communication
mechanism among artiﬁcial neurons.
However, eﬃcient strategies to estab-
lish such biologically-inspired commu-
nication in SNNs is still lacking, dras-
tically limiting the allowed computing
functions.[3]
Furthermore, learning/memory func-
tions of the brain are based on the so-
called synaptic plasticity, enabling neu-
rons to change the weight of the synaptic
connections depending on the received
external stimuli through neurotransmit-
ter modulation.[4] This mechanism al-
lows biological neural networks (BNNs)
to perform multiple operations, such as
learning and computation, in an energy-
eﬃcient way.[5]
Similarly, by featuring brain-inspired
plasticity behavior, artiﬁcial neuromor-
phic devices enable parallel computing
algorithms with low energy consumption
and high reliability.[6,7]

Indeed, over the last decade, artiﬁcial neuromorphic systems
have been designed by exploiting memristive devices whose con-
ductance can be modulated to emulate the signal transmission
of a biological synapse.[8,9] In this scenario, organic neuromor-
phic devices based on conductive polymers (CPs) have emerged
in bio-integrated applications because of their biocompatibility
and mixed conduction (electronic and ionic) suitable for physio-
logical processes, biomolecules-mediated operation and integra-
tion with cells and tissue.[10,11] Due to their peculiar doping/de-
doping processes, organic mixed ionic-electronic semiconduc-
tors feature a large dynamic range, i.e., they allow conductance
modulations in a window (between their highest and lowest
states) that is larger than 2x their initial conductance value.[12]
They enable analog tuning which is ideal for parallel comput-
ing applications.[13] One class of organic neuromorphic devices
are based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which
have lately shown the ability to modify their conductive state
upon an external stimulation (i.e., electrical pulses at the gate
electrode) and to retain this altered conditioning over time, re-
sembling synaptic plasticity.[7] In particular, when the active ma-
terial is poly(3,4-ethylene- dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate
(PEDOT:PSS), the device operates in depletion mode and the ap-
plication of a voltage bias at the gate electrode causes a de-doping
of the ﬁlm due to cations penetrating its bulk.[14] This mecha-
nism is reversed upon removal of the voltage bias. Employing
high-frequency voltage pulses as inputs, the reversibility of the
process is hindered so that cations accumulate inside the PEDOT
channel causing a cumulative de-doping which emulates short-
term depressive behavior (STD).[15]
The evolution of such systems towards bio-integrated and
synaptic biomimicking applications has led to the development
of neurotransmitter-mediated artiﬁcial synapses, i.e., devices
working with species that participate in the biological signal-
ing mechanisms such as dopamine (DA).[16] From these con-
cepts, biohybrid synapses has been developed establishing a long-
term plasticity relationship between the oxidation of dopamine
(released by cells directly coupled with the active material) and

the memory state (conductance) of the organic neuromorphic
device.[17]
However, in a biological synapse multiple neurotransmitters
participate to the signaling mechanisms.[18,19] For instance, DA
and serotonin (5-HT) are important neuromodulators contribut-
ing to the regulation of synaptic plasticity such as long-term po-
tentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD).[20–22] Thus, sophisticated
and adaptable bio-hybrid interfaces actively interacting with neu-
rons must be able to correctly identify interrelated biological cues
such as the concentration and distribution of these neurotrans-
mitters. As such, the ﬁrst step towards these next-generation bio-
hybrid systems is the design of artiﬁcial synapses mediated by
multiple neurotransmitters which could be further integrated
into SNNs. In this context, organic artiﬁcial synapses may serve
to both enhance the inference and training of spiking networks
and emulate speciﬁc synaptic functions.[3]
Here, we engineer an artiﬁcial synapse by integrating a ﬂuid
chamber for the control of neurotransmitter solutions ﬂow in
an ENODe design. This platform is able to display short and
long-term conditioning mediated by two neurotransmitters by ex-
ploiting their selective oxidation: a key biological computational
primitive. We show that this weight modulation is reversible,
and essential for implementation in artiﬁcial neural networks.
We simultaneously monitor the conditioning electrically and op-
tically, and demonstrate the coexpression of multiple neurotrans-
mitters to emulate neuronal learning and forgetting patterns.
Indeed, optical detection approaches have emerged in the last
years due to their unprecedented ﬂexibility for choosing regions
of interest.[23,24]
This work paves the way for sophisticated bio-hybrid neuro-
morphic interfaces, comprising array of mutually dependent de-
vices that are controlled by multiple neurotransmitters resulting
from a variety of physiological cues that can be closely monitored
using noninvasive optical readouts.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Device Design and Opto-Electronic Characterization
An ENODe (Figure 1 and Figure S1, S2, Supporting Information)
was fabricated as described in Methods. Here, the gate terminal
represents the presynaptic end of the artiﬁcial synapse while the
transistor channel acts as the post-synaptic terminal.[17] The gate
electrode has been exposed to two diﬀerent neurotransmitters
(DA and 5-HT) which can be oxidized upon the application of
a gate bias (oxidation potential).[17] This potential has been de-
termined for each neurotransmitter through cyclic voltammetry
(CV) (Methods and Figure S3, Supporting Information) as 0.3 V,
0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), for DA and 5-HT, respectively which is also
in agreement with previous results.[25,26]
Additionally, chronoamperometry measurements (Figure S4,
Supporting Information) were performed to determine the neu-
rotransmitters’ diﬀusion coeﬃcients resulting as 2.4 × 10−6
cm2s−1 and 1.9 × 10−5 cm2s−1 for DA and 5-HT, respectively.
Here, although DA and 5-HT have diﬀerent diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcients, due to the neurotransmitters speciﬁc interaction at
the surface of the PEDOT:PSS electrode, they both display a
diﬀusion-controlled oxidation mechanism (Figure S4 and S5,
Supporting Information).[27]

ered showing that the modulation triggered by DA is semi-reversible (>80% recovery) while 5-HT leads to more permanent modulations (<27%
recovery).

Then, the long-term memory of the artiﬁcial synapse mediated
by the individual neurotransmitters (Figure 1a) was character-
ized through the application of periodic voltage pulses (presynap-
tic signals at the gate electrode consisting of three-square pulses
with 3s duration and 10s delay between pulses), whose ampli-
tudes correspond to the previously determined neurotransmit-
ter’s oxidation potential (Figure 1b and Figure S3, Supporting In-
formation).
The ENODe works as a depletion mode OECT : when a positive
gate bias is applied cations from the electrolyte are injected into
the channel terminal and compensate the anions on PSS−chains
decreasing the number of holes and so the drain current (PE-
DOT:PSS de-doping).[14] This leads to a reversible conductance
modulation in case no neurotransmitters are present in the elec-
trolyte solution (Figure 1bii, black dotted traces).
Here, in presence of a neurotransmitter, the PEDOT:PSS chan-
nel conductance decreases in a nonreversible way due to the de-
doping process (Figure 1bii, red and blue solid traces).[17] This
mechanism is strongly inﬂuenced by protons and electrons pro-
duced during the oxidation reaction thus depending on the type
of neurotransmitter and its concentration in the solution as pre-
viously shown.[17]
In parallel, in situ time-resolved UV-vis measurements allow
for monitoring the kinetics of penetrating ions in the polymer
ﬁlm[28]: in the optical density (OD) spectrum, a new absorp-
tion peak at ≈650 nm is detected whose amplitude is increased
by the de-doping process (Figure S6, Supporting Information).
Optical readouts methods for PEDOT:PSS have been previously
proposed,[29] though here both electronical and optical measure-
ments are simultaneously collected not only for material charac-
terization but precisely for neuromorphic applications. The inte-
gral of optical density in the region 550–650 nm (∫OD) and its
time-dependence have been extracted (Figures S6 and S7, Sup-
porting Information) and compared to the channel conductance
variations (Figures S8, S9, S10 and Table S1, Supporting Infor-
mation), establishing a readouts correspondence: the same presy-
naptic signal elicits comparable variations of optical density and
conductance (Figure 1biii) with respect to their relative baseline
values, i.e., the readout values before the modulation (Figures
S8,S10 and Tables S1,S2, Supporting Information).
Thus, both channel conductance and integral of optical den-
sity variations represent the modulation of the artiﬁcial synapse
weight and as such correspond to the “memory of the device”: the
neurotransmitters electrochemical signal is converted and stored
through an opto-electronically readable and stable mechanism
(ΔGD, ∆∫OD).
Interestingly, synapses operating with DA and 5-HT display
speciﬁc modulations of ∆GD and ∆∫OD (evaluated in percent-
ages) so that the synapse conditioning is correlated to the speciﬁc
neurotransmitter that has been employed as oxidizing species
(Figures S8 and Table S1, Supporting Information) due to the
distinct number of electrons and cations produced (Figure 1bii-
iii). This conditioning is also permanently retained due to the
electrons produced and donated to the channel polymer, while si-
multaneously inducing the penetration of cations from the elec-
trolyte to keep charge neutrality (Figure S8 and S9, Supporting
Information).[17,26] In terms of percentages of modulation, for the
lowest concentration of DA and 5-HT (0.025mM and 0.01mM,
respectively) the ratio between the electronic and optical mod-
ulations values is ≈2.3–2.5 (Table S1, Supporting Information),
while for the higher concentrations (0.1mM and 0.05mM, respec-
tively) the same ratio moves to 2.8.
Inspired by the mechanism of BNNs working to mini-
mize their occupied storage by memory erasure and control
processes,[30,31] the intrinsic properties of PEDOT:PSS are here
explored to reverse the de-doping process and possibly ‘erase’
a previously established conductance or optical density level
(synaptic extinction following synaptic conditioning).
Here, the de-doping mechanism of the PEDOT:PSS channel
can be reversed exploiting the un-binding of H+ from the PSS−
domains (the mechanisms of doping/de-doping are explained in
Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information).[32] To achieve this,
in presence of electrolyte only, periodic voltage pulses have been
applied with increasing amplitude (8 pulses of 3 s, delay 0 s, from
0.1 to 0.8 V, voltage step of 0.1 V) such that the penetrated cations
can return to the electrolyte (extinction), restoring the initial con-
ductance level of the transistor channel (Figure 1bii-iii).
Based on this, we observed that in the case of DA for both the
examined concentrations (0.025 mM and 0.05mM) the GD and
∫OD modulations (5.07 and 12.21% of GD and 2.04 and 4.33%
of ∫OD, respectively) increase with the neurotransmitter concen-
tration in the conditioning phase. These modulation values have
been extracted from the traces presented in Figure 1 (Figure S8
Supporting Information contains a detailed description of this
analysis). The optical and electronical modulations can be par-
tially reversed through the periodic gate pulses under PBS ﬂow
(extinction phase) achieving a recovery of the initial GD and ∫OD
> 75% (Figure 1c,d, extinction/conditioning %). The percentages
of the extinction/recovery ratios (hereafter named % of recov-
ery) have been obtained from the ratio-to-percentage of extinc-
tion/conditioning values (Table S1, Supporting Information). In
the case of DA, due to the eﬃcient extinction mechanism (high
values of % of recovery), the eﬀects of a double cycle of condition-
ing/extinction phases have been investigated (Figure S11, Sup-
porting Information). The artiﬁcial synapse, employing the low-
est concentration of DA (0.025mM), can allow repetitive cycles of
learning/forgetting (Figure S16, Supporting Information).
5-HT solutions (0.01mM and 0.05mM, Figure 1b blue traces),
after conditioning, lead to comparable values of GD and ∫OD
modulations (4.68 and 11.30% of GD and 2.02 and 4.0% of ∫OD,
respectively) but induced a limited recovery of the conductance
and integral of optical density (comprised in the window 10%–
30%, Table S1, Supporting Information), suggesting a perma-
nent long-term synaptic modulation.
In the case of 5-HT higher anodic current are recorded with
a stronger de-doping of the polymer channel compared to the
other neurotransmitter (Figures S3,S4, S5, Supporting Informa-
tion). However, the % of recovery values extracted from the si-
multaneous opto-electronical monitoring almost coincide. Con-
sidering for example the DA 0.025mM solution, the percentage of
recovery values from the electronical and optical readout are 90%
and 85%, respectively. Increasing the concentration of the neuro-
transmitters, only minor diﬀerences are encountered: these can
be ascribed to the diﬀerent rates at which the two species cause
a fouling of the electrode in the static case. Whilst the two read-
out methods produce modulations values of diﬀerent units which
cannot be directly compared, the respective recovery percentages
are close to being equal thus proving the intimate correspon-

to probe the same phenomena (PEDOT:PSS de-doping/doping,
Figure S10, and Table S2, Supporting Information).
2.2. Dynamic Characterization of Neurotransmitter-Electrode
Interaction
To achieve a ﬁne control on the plasticity (conductance modula-
tion) of the post-synaptic terminal, the ﬂuid chamber integrated
(Figure S1, Supporting Information) with the organic neuromor-
phic device was exploited to dynamically adjust the neurotrans-
mitters’ solution concentration over time. Here, the combined
eﬀect of the neurotransmitter diﬀusion and ﬂow rate were inves-
tigated by monitoring the current at the gate electrode Ig while
applying a constant gate bias that triggers the oxidation process
(Figure 2ai,ii). A Langmuir model has been proposed in order to
elucidate the artiﬁcial synapse’s response (Figure S12, Support-
ing Information).[33] The experimental Ig curves are replicated by
this model’s function (dotted circle in Figure 2bi,ii), highlighting
that high ﬂow regimes increase the number of species available
for the oxidation while also preventing the gate electrode fouling
caused by the reaction by-products, resulting in higher, sharper
and faster occurring Ig peaks.
As such, in static and low ﬂow-rate conditions (0 and 0.5-mL
min−1 ﬂow, respectively) the neurotransmitters’ oxidation is dom-
inated by mass transport towards the electrode which leads to low
values of Ig. On the other hand, the increase of the electrolyte ﬂow
causes the rise of the Ig maximum value due to a constant refresh
of species available for the oxidation at the gate electrode.[34]
However, high ﬂow regimes (1.5 and 2 mL min−1 for DA and
5-HT, respectively) aﬀect the interaction of the neurotransmit-
ters with the gate electrode, hindering the oxidation process (Fig-
ure 2bi-ii and Figure S10, Supporting Information).
In light of this, the neurotransmitters in solution induce a ﬂow
regimes-dependent modulation of the channel conductance and
integral of optical density as reported in Figure 3bi,ii (for the com-
plete statistics see also Figure S13 and Table S4, Supporting In-
formation). Here, by applying the same periodic voltage pulses of
the conditioning experiment (Figure 1bi), we determined the dif-
ferent neurotransmitters ﬂow ranges that induce the maximum
ΔGD and Δ∫OD as 1 and 1.5 mL min−1 for DA and 5-HT, respec-
tively (Figure 3bi,ii and Table S4, Supporting Information).
Hence, the ΔGD and Δ∫OD modulations ﬂow regimes depen-
dency can be exploited as a strategy to replicate DA and 5-HT
molecules binding to post-synaptic receptors in the synaptic po-
tentiated (large modulation) and depressed states (low modula-
tion). Also, the devices proved to be stable for up to two weeks
since their fabrication (Figure S13, Supporting Information).
2.3. Mimicking Biological Neurotransmitter Corelease Using the
Artiﬁcial Synapse
Most neurons in the brain release more than one chemical work-
ing as a neuromodulator, each conveying a principal message, so
the neural signaling mechanism is often regulated by the com-
plex orchestration of multiple neurotransmitters.[19] Here, the
simultaneous presence of multiple neurotransmitters and their
concurrent oxidation at the gate electrode is exploited to ulti-
mately modulate the channel conductance (Figure 4a).
First, binary neurotransmitters solutions have been charac-
terized through CV, transconductance, and diﬀerential pulsed
voltammetry (DPV) measurements to evaluate possible interfer-
ing phenomena in their oxidation potentials previously evaluated
individually (Figure S3,S14, S15,S16, Supporting Information).
Figure S15 (Supporting Information) shows the transconduc-
tance, CV and DPV traces that refers to binary solutions contain-

ing DA:5HT (at diﬀerent concentrations) in which two distinct
peaks appear at 0.3 V and 0.4 V corresponding to the oxidation of
DA and 5-HT, respectively, as previously reported.[25]
The artiﬁcial synapse allows to tune its output response (to a
ﬁxed electrical input) through modulations (ΔG and Δ∫OD) that
can be controlled via chemical (type of neurotransmitters) and
ﬂuido-dynamic means. Indeed, these are two methods to ﬁnely
control the synaptic modulation and enable a wide range of dif-
ferent conditioning which allows this platform to reduce the gap
with the programming capability of a biological synapse.
In this context, the artiﬁcial synapse’s output depends on
the amplitude of the voltage pulses used as input and serves
to emulate the biological cotransmission mechanisms, as the
neurotransmitters examined here are oxidizing at speciﬁc gate
potentials.[18,35]
Figure 4bi,ii,iii show the modulation of the ENODe in pres-
ence of diverse neurotransmitters binary solutions at the ﬂow
rate of 1 mL min−1.
In case of DA:5-HT (0.025mM:0.01mM) mixture (Figure 4bii),
the application of a low presynaptic stimulation corresponding
to DA oxidation potential (0.3 V), results in electrical and opti-
cal modulations of the artiﬁcial synapse (6.21% of GD and 2.7%
of ∫OD) comparable to the ones obtained for the solution with
DA only (6.37% of GD and 2.6% of ∫OD) (Figure 4bi). By con-
trast, the application of a larger-synaptic input (Figure 4biii), cor-
responding to the 5-HT anodic potential (0.4 V), triggers the si-
multaneous oxidation of DA and 5-HT and results in large out-
put modulations (10% of GD and 4.7% of ∫OD). These values are
slightly lower than the arithmetic sum of the modulations ob-
tained by the individual neurotransmitter’s solution (DA+5-HT
15% of GD and 5.2% of ∫OD, Figure S13 and Table S4, Supporting
Information), possibly due to minor interferences phenomena
arising when the two species diﬀuse simultaneously towards the
electrode interface where they compete for oxidation.[27,36] Nev-
ertheless, the selectivity of the oxidation mechanisms enables a
voltage amplitude-dependent synaptic modulation that allows to
prove the eﬃciency of the biological emulation process.
3. Conclusion
In this work, we presented an artiﬁcial synaptic platform based
on a ENODe architecture with two neurotransmitters-mediated
plasticity. We have proved that the synaptic weight modulation
of this neuromorphic platform is reversible, and it depends not
only on the concentration of neurotransmitters but also on the
type of released neurotransmitters, allowing to emulate neuronal
learning and forgetting patterns, and to replicate these biorele-
vant molecules binding to speciﬁc post-synaptic receptors vary-
ing in size, number, and distribution.
Crucially, the proposed approach that exploits the optical spec-
trum variations of PEDOT:PSS to evaluate the synaptic condition-
ing, paves the way to the use of spectroscopic techniques in en-
gineering neuromorphic circuits such as SNNs.
A noninvasive optical array facilitates the bio-hybrid cou-
pling with tissues while the correspondence between electroni-
cal (channel conductance, GD) and optical (channel absorbance
spectrum, speciﬁcally the integral of optical density, ∫OD) modu-
lation may be employed as a further strategy to control the SNNs
inter-neuronal communication enabling feedback regulated and
memory/learning functions.
The neurotransmitter-speciﬁc synaptic plasticity combined
with the reversibility of the process is able to transduce synap-
tic signals allowing it to pass from in vitro cultures comprising
models of neuronal cells (PC-12 cells which express mainly DA)
to cell cultures expressing multiple neurotransmitters.
Ultimately, SNNs comprising artiﬁcial neurons and artiﬁcial
synapses are envisioned where the synaptic weight of each spik-
ing element interconnection is selectively programmable, and
the associated information may be intentionally stored.
Such spiking networks may include cascading neural path-
ways that perform sensory coding and signal propagation with
a local modulation of neurons spiking activity. Hence, the opto-
electronic readout with the reversible programming capabilities
opens to previously unexplored learning/forgetting paradigms.
These surpass in computing performance the conventional par-
allel programming standards by exploiting a bio-inspired signal
processing which is i) neurotransmitter-selective, ii) combines
multiple inputs and iii) dynamically adapts to the neuronal bi-
ological scenarios.
4. Experimental Section
ENODe Fabrication:
The ENODe devices were fabricated on glass-ITO
patterned substrates purchased from Xin Yan Technology Ltd. The size
of the glass square substrates is 25 mm with patterned squares of ITO
(20 ohm sq−1) of 10 mm covering each corner. Substrates were cleaned
through sonication in IPA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 20 min. Employing
Kapton tape and using a PMMA master mask, 2 stripes connecting op-
posed ITO squares (with ﬁxed width 3 mm and length 20 mm) were traced
for the deposition of the polymer mixture. PEDOT:PSS (Hereaus, Clevios
PH 1000) aqueous solution was prepared by adding 6 vol.% ethylene glycol
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to increase the PEDOT:PSS conductivity, 0.1 vol.%
dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as a surfactant, and
1 vol.% (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as a
crosslinking agent to improve mechanical stability. PEDOT:PSS solution
was spun on the selected areas of the substrate at 1 000 r.p.m. for 2 min
and baked at 120 °C for 20 min. Before the operation the devices were con-
ditioned at least 20 min in PBS solution, in order to avoid swelling eﬀects
during electrical measurements.
Fluid Chamber Fabrication:
Fluid channels were prepared using a
PMMA mold made by a micro-milling machine. PDMS was mixed with
a crosslinker in a ratio of 10:1 wt/wt and degassed in a vacuum desiccator
before being poured onto the mold and heated to 80 °C for 3 h to cure
(PDMS, Sylgard 184). A 1.5 mm diameter biopsy punch was used to cre-
ate the holes for inlets and outlets, which consisted of Teﬂon tubing (0.813
mm inner diameter, 1.32 mm outer diameter). A small amount of uncured
PDMS was used to coat the bottom surface of the PDMS ﬂuidic channel
before placing it onto the glass-ITO substrate, which was subsequently
baked at 80 °C for at least 1h.
Neurotransmitters’ Solutions Preparation:
Neurotransmitters’ solu-
tions were freshly prepared by dissolving dopamine hydrochloride (98%,
Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and serotonin hydrochloride (98%, Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) into Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buﬀered Saline (Modiﬁed, without cal-
cium chloride and magnesium chloride, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at a diﬀerent
concentration ranging from 0.01 mM to 2 mM. Mixed neurotransmitters
solutions were prepared by diluting single neurotransmitter ones.
Presynaptic – Gate Measurements:
The electrochemical characteriza-
tions were performed by CV, DPV, and chronoamperometry techniques
using an Autolab PGSTAT302N potentiostat/galvanostat (Metrohm AG,
Switzerland) and the NOVA 1.8.14 software built-in routines. For these
measurements, the ENODe channel was disconnected. The electrochem-
ical potential values of the neurotransmitters reported in the manuscript

and in the Figure S3,S4,S5,S14,S15,S16 were measured with respect to
a standard Ag/AgCl reference electrode while a Pt wire was used as the
counter electrode (both terminals were inserted in the ﬂuidic module). The
ENODe gate PEDOT:PSS thin ﬁlm was used as the working electrode. For
CV measurements the potential was swept from −0.2 V to 0.6 V at variable
scan rates (1,5,10.30,50 mV s−1). For DPV, the instrumental variables were
studied, and the optimum conditions resulted: pulse amplitude: 0.050 V;
increment: 0.004 V; sample width: 4 s; pulse width: 5 s; pulse period: 10
s; sensitivity: 1 × 102 μA. For chronoamperometry, the working electrode
was subjected to diﬀerent potential steps (V = +0.3 V for DA, V = +0.4 V
for 5-HT, V = +0.5 V for AA) and the current response was measured for
a period of 20 s with a sensitivity of 1 × 102 μA.
Postsynaptic Measurements:
Devices were characterized using 2 com-
mercial platforms: ARKEO multichannel (located in TU/e Eindhoven) and
ARKEO all-in-one (located in IIT Naples) developed by Cicci Research
(Italy). These systems are composed of a thermal controlled stage, two
ﬂuidic pumps and two-channel and four-channel source meter units, re-
spectively. The system (Eindhoven or Naples) used for various sets of ex-
periments that are here presented is speciﬁed. Either needle or spring con-
tact probes (as speciﬁed) were used to access the ENODe’s gate and drain
electrodes. The electrolyte ﬂow across the device was controlled using two
ﬂuidic pumps (Syringe-pump) controlled by custom LabView software. To
preliminary test the devices, transfer curves were taken by sweeping the
presynaptic electrode voltage from −0.2 V to +0.8 V (VG) while applying a
constant VD = – 0.1V on the postsynaptic electrode.
Optical measurements (ARKEO Multichannel):
Excitation light was
provided by a LED Tower (Cicci Research, Italy) (see Supplementary Fig-
ure S1) assembled on top of the Arkeo stage; the LED Tower comprises
a set of 13 LEDs which allow to select, and combine, diﬀerent excitation
wavelengths. For all the performed experiments, a warm white light (range
>4750K) was used. Optical detection was performed with a CCD based
spectrometer (360–1050 nm), multimode bundle, and a 10 mm diameter
aspheric lens close to the substrate (access from the bottom of the Arkeo
stage, see Figure S1, Supporting Information). The spot size was roughly
1 mm, and its position (indicated in Figure S1, Supporting Information)
corresponds with the center of the channel area.
Amperometry In-Flow Measurements (ARKEO all-in-one):
For these
measurements, the ENODe channel was left unconnected. To the gate
electrode, used as working electrode, potential steps were applied
(V = +0.3 V for DA and V = +0.4 V for 5-HT) and the current re-
sponse was measured for a period of 60 s. The ﬂuidic module was
preloaded with PBS solution. As the electrical measurement was started,
the syringe pump was activated in sync by a Labview routine (ﬂow rates
tested were 0.1,0.5,0.7,1,1.3,1.5,1.7, 2 mL min−1) so that the selected
PBS-NT solution was ﬂuxed while monitoring the Ig with resolution of
0.02 ms.
Synaptic Weight Modulation & Reversibility In-Flow Experiments (ARKEO
Multichannel):
In this conﬁguration, both the ENODe channel and gate
electrodes were connected via needle probes. Pulsed measurements were
performed using a set of voltage pulses on the gate (3s ON, 10s OFF)
to target the oxidation of each NT (VG = + 0.3 V for DA, VG = + 0.4 V
for 5-HT) while monitoring the postsynaptic conductance (VD = −0.1 V).
Simultaneously, the optical spectra were recorded via the coupled optical
ﬁber.
For the static experiments (Figure 1), the ﬂuidic module was preloaded
with the solution PBS-neurotransmitter in exam, but the syringe pumps
were not activated. After the set of pulses deﬁning the learning protocol
(50 s), the pumps were activated for ﬂuxing PBS solution at 1 mL min−1.
Simultaneously, on the gate were applied three trains of voltage pulses
with increasing amplitude (0.1 to 0.8 Vg, ∆Vg 0.1V, Vd -0.1 V) with a 120 s of
delay while still monitoring the postsynaptic conductance (VD = −0.1 V).
The device response was deﬁned as the ∆GD% and ∆∫OD% (see below
section) measured 240s after the end of the last train of pulses (800 s since
the start of the measurement) while still ﬂuxing PBS.
For pulsing-in-ﬂow experiments (Figure 2, Figure S13, and Tables S4,
Supporting Information), the ﬂuidic module was preloaded with the solu-
tion PBS-NT in exam and a syringe containing the NTs solution was acti-
vated and set to the desired ﬂow regime (from 0.5, 1, 1.5 to 2mL min−1)
10s before starting the opto-electronic measurement.
Synaptic Weight Modulation & Reversibility Parameters Extraction and
Data Analysis:
For the electronic readout in the used conﬁguration, one
channel the AKEO setup served to record the channel current. The mea-
sured current traces were converted into conductance by dividing them
for the VD applied on the channel (−0.1 V). To obtain the device electronic
modulation from these traces, the point value of conductance at time 10s
(right before the start of the train of voltage pulses) was extracted as the
“baseline conductance value” (reported in Figure S8,S9, Table S1, Sup-
porting Information). Similarly, the point value of the conductance trace
at time 45 s (5 s after the last pulse) was assumed as the after-modulation
value. To better appreciate the electronic readout and reduce the device-
to-device variations in baseline conductance, the conductance variations
∆GD have been normalized by the “baseline conductance value” for each
recorded trace (examined device). Thus, %∆GD values are reported in the
tables and in the main text for the electronic readout. Finally, the recovery
of the electronic baseline has been extracted using the point value of the
conductance at the time 800 s.
For the optical readout in the used conﬁguration, the optical ﬁber
records the transmitted light in counts through the device channel. Prior
measurements, the ﬁber was calibrated by acquiring a spectrum in a no-
light condition corresponding to the blank/dark (LED oﬀ) and a reference
spectrum corresponding to the baseline value (LED on). In both condi-
tions, the ENODe device was placed under the Tower LED on the Arkeo
stage while the needle probes for electronic measurement were connected
to the electrodes and the ﬂuidic tubes were in place. As such, both the
reference spectra consider that the LED probing light crosses the optical
media corresponding to the ﬂuidic module (PDMS septum) and the glass
substrate.
The ﬁber counts acquisition trace from 360 to 1050 nm (full spectral
data) was also converted, visualized on the ARKEO software (Cicci Re-
search, Italy) and simultaneously saved as transmittance, absorbance, and
integral of the absorbance in the region of interest (550-650 nm) for a live
monitoring of the traces during the measurements.
Due to the activation of the ﬂuidic pump after the modulation section
of the experiment (50 s), in many experiments, the optical trace recorded
over time (either transmittance, absorbance, or integral or absorbance)
present some artifacts (jumps over scale of the recorded values) that are
connected to the vibration of the PDMS section due to the incoming PBS
solution ﬂow. Following these spikes point-artifacts, the optical baseline
might show a shift to slightly higher or lower values compared to the
value recorded at 49–50 s (start of the PBS ﬂow). Cleaning of the data
was performed in order to restore the device baseline by applying a cor-
rective shift to the optical traces after the spikes and jumps (100 s on) to
match the baseline level values at 49 s. Thus, both the electronic and op-
tical traces are visualized in the windows of conditioning (0—45 s) and
recovery (100—800 s) where no artifacts are clearly present. Due to the in-
trinsic noise of the optical measurements, as reported in the SI, the optical
traces (∆∫OD) have been smoothed by a smoothing box function with a
factor of 5 in the range 0—45 s and a factor of 100 in the range 100—800
s. To obtain the “optical trace baseline value”, the integral-of optical den-
sity ∆∫OD traces have been scaled to the arbitrary starting value of 0.1 in
correspondence of the ﬁrst point in the time scale before the start of the
train of voltage pulses (time 9.7 s–10.1 s, there is a short time-shift re-
spect to the electronic reading). Then, the optical trace point values were
averaged in the window 40–45 s (5 s after the last pulse) to obtain the
after-modulation optical value. As in the case of the electronic readout (to
reduce device-to-device variations), the variations ∆∫OD have been nor-
malized by the initial ∫OD. Thus, ∆∫OD% values are reported in the tables
and in the main text for the optical readout. Finally, the recovery of the op-
tical baseline has been extracted using the average of the ∫OD values in
the window 750—800 s to reduce the device-to-device variations due to
the intrinsic noise of these measurements.
All the values reported in the tables and in the graph of this manuscript
are the result of an average over three replica experiments performed on
three devices.

Transconductance Measurements (ARKEO all-in-one):
In this conﬁgu-
ration both the ENODe channel and gate electrode were connected to
ARKEO all-in-one via spring probes. The gate potential was swept, repli-
cating the CV protocol (from -0.2 to 0.6 V) while monitoring the GD con-
ductance. The transconductance was directly derived through a built-in
Lab-view routine (Cicci Research, Italy). For static measurements, the ﬂu-
idic module was preloaded with the examined solution while for in-ﬂow
experiments the syringe pump was activated 10s before starting the elec-
trical measurement and kept active.
