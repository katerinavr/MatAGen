Organic mixed conductors have garnered signiﬁcant attention in applications from bioelec-
tronics to energy storage/generation. Their implementation in organic transistors has led to
enhanced biosensing, neuromorphic function, and specialized circuits. While a narrow class
of conducting polymers continues to excel in these new applications, materials design efforts
have accelerated as researchers target new functionality, processability, and improved per-
formance/stability. Materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) require both
efﬁcient electronic transport and facile ion injection in order to sustain high capacity. In this
work, we show that the product of the electronic mobility and volumetric charge storage
capacity (µC*) is the materials/system ﬁgure of merit; we use this framework to benchmark
and compare the steady-state OECT performance of ten previously reported materials. This
product can be independently veriﬁed and decoupled to guide materials design and pro-
cessing. OECTs can therefore be used as a tool for understanding and designing new organic
mixed conductors.

O
rganic mixed conductors are soft, often polymeric
materials based on traditional organic electronic materi-
als. These materials support electronic charge transport
along their conjugated backbones, while allowing for ionic (mass)
transport through the bulk. Like their inorganic counterparts, it is
the interaction of ionic and electronic species that allow for the
diverse applications ranging from battery electrodes to electro-
chromic windows and sensors1. The interplay between ionic and
electronic carriers is critical for energy storage and generation
including pseudo/supercapacitors2, 3, batteries4, fuel cells5 and
ionic-organic ratchets6. Furthermore, organic mixed conductors
have found utility in applications where large area processing is
required (i.e., electrochromics), where the motion of ions through
the bulk can lead to signiﬁcant changes in physical properties
(mechanical actuators, electrochromics, switchable surfaces)7–9,
or
where
the
material’s
intimate
contact
with a
sensing
environment can lead to enhanced sensitivity or selectivity
(sensors)10, 11. Where one application requires selectivity, another
requires fast response; where one requires stability, another
requires capacity. While device-based characterization of such
properties enables comparison, lacking is a materials-based ﬁgure
of merit to benchmark and guide synthetic/processing design and
development.
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have received
signiﬁcant attention for their promise as circuit elements12,
neuromorphic devices13, and sensing/stimulation elements useful
in bioelectronics applications13–15. The ability for organic mixed
conductors to support ion penetration (and thus bulk charge
capacity) has allowed for high performance OECTs to be devel-
oped as amplifying transducers for bioelectronic applications15.
In many cases, the enhanced sensing capability of OECTs has
allowed them to outpace both mixed conductor-coated electrodes
and similarly sized inorganic transistors based on non-mixed
conductors16, 17.
In an OECT, the mixed conductor channel bridging a source
and drain electrode is in direct contact with an electrolyte rich in
mobile ions (Fig. 1). The current between source and drain
electrodes, ID, is modulated by a change in effective gate bias, VG
(applied at an immersed gate electrode or resulting from cellular
or (bio)molecular activity), through a bulk gating effect facilitated
by ion penetration. Operation through bulk doping yields both
low bias operation, a hallmark of electrolyte gated transistors, but
also high capacitance. Due to the motion of both electronic and
ionic charges in the channel, mobility extraction cannot be, in a
straight forward manner, performed via the transconductance
method as applied for ﬁeld effect transistors (FETs). For this
reason, OECT researchers often report device transconductance,
which is the slope of the ID −VG transfer curve, gm = ∂ID/∂VG
(see Fig. 1b). While this term is sometimes reported as a nor-
malized value (e.g., by channel width, W, or by drain voltage, VD),
reporting standards are not well established. Nevertheless, gm is a
direct measure of effective signal ampliﬁcation of a single OECT;
which, for instance, determines whether the OECT will be able to
operate as a biosensor, i.e., transduce small biological signals.
Furthermore, gm depends on both the channel geometry and
biasing conditions and describes the steady-state performance of
the device. As such, it does not represent the performance of the
mixed conductor, yet can be used to derive an appropriate ﬁgure
of merit for fair materials comparison.
The conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
complexed with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is among
the most commonly studied materials in OECT research, and has
allowed for signiﬁcant device physics and modeling development.
It is stable in aqueous conditions, processable by a variety of
methods, allows for both electronic and ionic transport, and
importantly, is readily commercially available3, 18. Previous work
has shown that volumetric capacitance (~40 F cm−3 in PEDOT:
PSS) governs high transconductance; consequently, the physical
ﬁlm thickness of the OECT channel, d, plays a critical role in
determining both transient and steady-state device character-
istics15. These ﬁndings can be corroborated and derived15,
resulting in the following scaling of OECT transconductance:
gm ¼ Wd
L
μC Vth  VG
ð
Þ
ð1Þ
Where µ is the electronic carrier mobility, and C* is the capaci-
tance of the channel per unit volume. Vth is the threshold voltage.
In the limiting case where the channel thickness drops to a
monolayer, the product of d and C* is C′ (capacitance per unit
area), which collapses to the transconductance equation for FETs:
gm ¼ W
L μ C′ Vth  VG
ð
Þ
ð2Þ
In the equation governing the OECT performance (Eq. (1)), the
geometry dependence is captured by the Wd/L term and the gate
bias offset by (Vth −VG). This leaves the product of µ and C* as
the only nominally geometry- and bias-independent terms, and
thus a materials-system dependent product.
Device-based ﬁgures of merit that are treated as materials
properties are especially useful in materials evaluation and
development. For example, OFET materials are often bench-
marked based on their µFET, while thermoelectric materials are

deﬁned with their ZT ﬁgure of merit. It is proposed herein that
the µC* product is the materials-system ﬁgure of merit for
OECTs. This term captures the steady-state ionic/electronic
transport processes within the channel material, under device
operation. Herein, we use this framework to compare and
benchmark ten previously published organic mixed conductor
materials. We further explore how a decoupling of µC* into µ and
C* can aid in materials design, including synthetic strategies and
processing approaches. Knowing the µ and C* of the channel
material, we can predict the steady-state performance, i.e., gm, of
an OECT given a certain geometry and operation condition. We
suggest that the µC* product could be useful for informing
materials selection in other mixed conductor applications.
Results
µC* for benchmarking OECT materials. µC* captures the mixed
ionic-electronic transport properties of the OECT channel
material. When determined using Eq. (1), µ, the electronic
mobility, reﬂects the device-scale electronic charge transport in
the channel, and has been shown to be comparable to values
determined by complementary methods, such as Hall effect
mobility19. C* is a measure of the capacity of the bulk material (a
volumetric term, as opposed to gravimetric, often used for energy
storage devices). This term is a convolution of both the ionic
penetration/transport within the polymeric morphology, and the
ability for the conjugated backbone to store and collect electronic
charges. Ultimately, C* should be a steady-state characteristic,
and should reach this value at experimentally or application
relevant time scales.
To extract the µC* product, it is sufﬁcient to measure gm and
carefully note the device geometry parameters and biasing
conditions. However, a more rigorous investigation, where
multiple devices of varying geometries are measured, allows for
both proper veriﬁcation of OECT scaling (i.e., gm~Wd/L), and for
a more statistically supported µC* determination. Following Eq.
(1), the data can be plotted as gm vs. Wd L−1|Vth −VG|, where the
slope is [µC*]OECT. This is shown for the materials investigated in
Fig. 2a. Variability or spreading in values can be attributed to
non-uniformities in ﬁlm formation, edge effects and their
ampliﬁed effects in small devices, and difﬁculty in measuring
thickness for small devices. This µC* product is then plotted for
all ten materials in Fig. 2b, where a clear ranking of materials is
evident.
Decoupling these terms can provide both validation and lead to
a facile route to understand why one material outperforms
another. For these materials, µ is determined by extracting the
electronic carrier transit time (τe) through the constant gate
current20, or impedance matching methods previously reported21
and described in Methods. C* is measured independently by
performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) mea-
surements on a polymer coated microelectrode. The EIS results
can be, in all materials discussed here, ﬁt to a simple equivalent
circuit: RsC or Rs(Rp||C) where Rp and C are the parallel resistance
and the capacitance associated with the polymer, respectively,
while Rs is the sum of the electrolyte and interconnect resistances
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The capacitive term in the circuit is then
normalized by the product of the measured electrode area and
ﬁlm thickness, i.e., the volume of the ﬁlm. It is required that a
material operates as a true OECT: at reported biases, ion
penetration should progress through the bulk of the ﬁlm (in this
simplistic case, lateral ion transport under the applied drain bias
is presently neglected)—meaning no stratiﬁcation, and no
dominance from ion accumulation at the electrolyte/channel
interface (otherwise accurate C* extraction is non-trivial, and the
OECT operation dictated by Eq. (1) does not apply).
The product of these independently measured values [µ] and
[C*] agree well with the [µC*] product attained from geometry-
dependent transconductance plot shown in Fig. 2a (Fig. 2b,
Table 1). While many materials do not show a direct 1:1 match
and often trend towards an underestimation in the independently
derived product [µ][C*], the relative relation amongst different
materials is maintained. The conjugated polyelectrolyte, PTHS,
shows the most signiﬁcant deviation. With this general agreement
in trends, we can properly benchmark materials for OECTs. For
example, the prototypical PEDOT:PSS exhibits a µC* of 47 ± 6 F
cm−1 V−1 s−1. The top performer to date is p(g2T-TT), a
glycolated thiophene-thienothiophene polymer22, with a µC* of
261 ± 29 F cm−1 V−1 s−1. It is important to note that in all of the
materials shown in Fig. 2, testing was performed with the same
setup, using a Ag/AgCl pellet as the reference/gate electrode and
0.1 M NaCl as the electrolyte.

µ-C* maps. By plotting the decoupled terms, µ-C* maps can be
assembled to aide in materials understanding and synthetic
design. On such a map, the highest µC* product is at the top right
(Fig. 2c), with lines of constant µC* denoted as the dotted diag-
onal lines. PEDOT:PSS, labeled as ①in Fig. 2c, has long been the
top performing material. PTHS ②, a conjugated polyelectrolyte,
was thought to be a
promising candidate material due to its
tethered ionic groups23, however the low µC* product suggests
otherwise. By decoupling these terms, it is clear that while this
material attains a C* value three times higher than that of
PEDOT:PSS, its hole mobility is ~×1000 lower. Thus, to further
improve the performance of OECTs based on this material, focus
should be placed on enhancing its mobility without hurting C*.
On the other hand, PEDOT:TOS ③, a vapor phase polymerized
(VPP) PEDOT doped with tosylate (TOS) ions, shows a similarly
high C* as PTHS, but maintains a mobility of ~1 cm2 V−1 s−1.
p(g2T-TT) ④, the top performing OECT material in this data set,
further pushes C* to 241 F cm−3, while still maintaining a high µ.
It is interesting to note that the only n-type material in this set,
p(gNDI-g2T), shows the highest C* value (397 F cm−3), and yet
its mobility keeps it from attaining the high transconductance of
its p-type counterparts22.
In this dataset, it is clear that µ varies over a larger range than
C*. However, a number of trends are deduced from Fig. 2c:
materials with comparable µ result in higher µC* products and
thus higher transconductance due to a higher C*. Grouping
materials, those possessing excess and bulky ionic or polyionic
dopants, i.e. PEDOT doped with various polyanions24, show
lower C* (<100 F cm−3) compared to the rest of the materials.
These materials may allow for efﬁcient swelling and faster ion
drift and diffusion, however, the “dead volume” from the excess,
electrically insulating phase lowers C*. Strategies for enhancing C*
are thus important, but doing so while maintaining high
mobilities can present a tradeoff that must be deftly navigated19.
Trajectories. Nevertheless, distilling a material to a single point in
µ-C* space can be misleading. For example, while often a mobility
value is assigned to an organic electronic material, it is well
known that mobility depends on charge density25, and can be
anisotropic, depending on morphology26, 27. Similarly, it has been
observed in electrolyte gated organic transistors that as charge
density is swept through a broad range (by sweeping the applied
gate voltage), both mobility and the observed capacitance can

vary signiﬁcantly, often passing through a peak value28, 29. For
mobility, this may be attributed to band ﬁlling or in some cases,
contact effects; for capacitance, the cause is potentially related to
barriers for ionic/electronic charge injection. It should be care-
fully noted that the derivation of Eq. (1) (ideal OECT operation)
assumes no such barriers. Thus, care must be taken in data
interpretation when operating in regimes of signiﬁcant voltage
dependent capacitance, as noted below. Voltage dependence of µ
and C* is shown in Fig. 3 for an accumulation mode glycolated
polymer, p(g2T-TT). The electronic mobility, determined from
an OECT, increases more than three orders of magnitude, with a
peak value at 0.3 V (Fig. 3a). When biased over the same range, a
drastic increase in capacitance starting at Voffset ~ −0.1 V is noted,
roughly saturating in the 0–0.6 V range (Fig. 3b). Such bias-
dependent functions can be represented in µ-C space as in Fig. 3c
—note that C′ is reported rather than C* since the degree of
uniformity of ion penetration through the bulk is unknown at low
VG. As mentioned, the applicability of the ﬁgure of merit does not
necessarily hold over the entire range. The highest transconduc-
tance for this device is achieved at the top right of this trajectory
which would correspond to the largest µC* product; in this case at
Voffset ~ 0.25 V, where proper OECT scaling is observed. All
reported single µ-C* values (Fig. 2) are at peak transconductance
in saturation regime, which, in some cases, is the peak trans-
conductance achieved before sample degradation or instability.
We can envisage other trajectories that can inform a processing
or formulation arc maximizing mixed conductivity. An example
of this type of trajectory is one where additives or solvent
treatments are applied in order to tune the microstructure of the
material, and therefore its properties. For instance, ethylene glycol
(EG) is a co-solvent commonly used to enhance electronic
conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Recently, we explored how this
additive simultaneously affects ion transport19, 30. This same
formulation set (with EG) can be examined with respect to µ and
C* (Fig. 4a, b). The µ-C* mapping of this trajectory (Fig. 4c) is in
further agreement with the results in ref. 19, showing that a peak
transconductance occurs at an intermediate EG concentration.
Discussion
Aside from such processing conditions, the peak µC* product of a
material can depend on other factors. Temperature, for example,
is an obvious variable. Well controlled experiments with liquid
(aqueous) electrolytes are, however, complicated when ﬁne tem-
perature control is desired, limiting the range of accessible tem-
peratures as the morphology of the channel material and the
phase and ion concentration of the electrolyte can simultaneously
change. A resulting implication is that the µC* product does not
depend solely on the dry material properties of the channel. It
should also be a system property encompassing the nature of the
electrolyte. The size, charge, and nature of the (solvated) ions
would have differing ion mobilities31, and different interactions
with the solid state ﬁlm; in some cases a large ion may not be able
to access the electroactive volume, which may limit C*. In the
extreme case, excessively large ions would not be able to penetrate
the channel, resulting in a true “ﬁeld effect” condition, where
accumulation would be limited to double layer formation at the
channel-electrolyte interface. The solvent of the electrolyte (in the
case of liquid electrolytes) could also interact and modify the
channel morphology depending on the nature of both polymer
and solvent—i.e., hydration and swelling—which could affect
both mobility and C*.
It is noteworthy that while the µC* product governs the steady
state characteristics of an OECT, it holds little relevance to the
transient behavior for materials that show true OECT operation.
In fact, gm does not include information directly associated with
the time scale of (de)charging of the ﬁlm. The response time of
the OECT will be a function of how fast the ions penetrate inside
the polymer and the electrons/holes are extracted at the source/
drain contacts. While much is known about electronic charge
transport, the drift of ions inside the ﬁlm along multiple direc-
tions and how this contributes to the switching speed of the
device are challenging to quantify. However, for the material to be
volumetrically doped/dedoped within the channel of an OECT on
application-relevant time scales, we postulate that there should
not be a signiﬁcant barrier for ion injection and that the mobility
of ions must be sufﬁciently high to allow for complete (de)
charging of the (semi)conductor channel. While materials such as
PEDOT:PSS show an agreement between the device response
time and the RC charging time of the transistor channel15, this is
likely not true for all materials herein. Nevertheless, even the
polymers for which ion transport is considered quite slow or at
least orders of magnitude slower than PEDOT:PSS (e.g., p(g2T-

TT), the top performer) are able to show OECT behavior and ﬁt
within the steady state µC* framework.
While ultimately, the µC* product can depend on a number of
factors, it is a powerful tool to benchmark materials and can be
used to directly compare materials being used as the active
channel in OECTs. We have shown that of nearly a dozen
reported materials for OECTs, representing the synthetic and
materials development work of six academic groups, the magni-
tude of the µC* ﬁgure of merit varies over three orders of mag-
nitude. The deconvolution of electronic mobility and the volume
density of bulk charge storage (indicative of ion penetration/
transport) aides in materials design, and can thus be used to
discuss organic mixed conductors in a common framework.
While directly applicable for studying OECT performance from
the transconductance perspective, relative materials benchmark-
ing can be a powerful tool to compare organic mixed conductors
of interest in other application areas.

OECT characterization. Materials and devices were prepared, as previously
reported19, 22–24, 32–35. They were all tested as noted in Fig. 1, with a Ag/AgCl
electrode (Warner Instruments) immersed in 0.1 M NaCl in deionized water.
OECT characterization was performed on either Keithley 2400 source measure
units (SMU) or a National Instruments PXIe system (equipped with NI-PXI-4071
digital multimeters, NI-PXI-4143 SMU and a NI-PXI-6289 DAQ), using custom
LabView software. Mobility (µOECT) was determined on the OECT channels the
same or comparable to those used to measure the current–voltage characteristics
and to extract the transconductance of the OECTs (i.e., same ﬁlm casting consi-
tions, comparable dimentions, and same effective gate biasing). Measurements
were performed by using the constant gate current method, where drain current
transients (dID/dt) are extracted for different constant gate currents, IG, at a par-
ticular drain bias, VD. The hole or electron transit time can then be calculated from
dID/dt = −IG/τe17, 20. Using the same relation, a frequency dependent approach can
be employed to extract the hole/electron transit time. A constant drain bias and a
sinusoidal voltage signal (ΔVG = 10–20 mV) at a gate voltage offset (VG,offset) are
applied depending on the biasing conditions of peak transconductance (similar to
EIS experiments). The resulting gate current and drain current sinusoids are
extracted to determine both amplitudes and phase shifts. The frequency domain
relation derived from the time domain analysis is: ΔIG(f) = 2πf τe ΔID. Thus,
matching the gate current and drain current derived impedance yields τe, as
detailed in ref. 21. Using the hole/electron transit time in the channel (τe), the
channel length, and the applied drain bias, µOECT can be estimated.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectro-
scopy (EIS) for determination of capacitance was measured on polymer coated
electrodes using either a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT128N or Gamry Reference 600
from 20 kHz to 1 Hz. The impedance spectra of the channel of the OECT or a
micron-scale ﬁlm coated on gold electrodes (3.48E-3 cm2 in area) were measured in
0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution, using a standard Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode
and a Pt mesh as the counter electrode. The measurements were performed at a DC
offset potential which enables the maximum achievable doping for the material and
an AC amplitude of 10 mV. Once the spectra were recorded, they were ﬁt to an
equivalent circuit using native tool software (Metrohm Autolab NOVA or Gamry
software) or MATLAB. The simplest circuit with a pure capacitor was used (i.e.,
RsC), or Randle’s circuit, Rs(Rp||C), and resulted in good ﬁt quality as shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1. The capacitance values that are extracted were normalized by
the measured ﬁlm volume or plotted as a function of volume and then ﬁt to a line
to determine volumetric capacitance (C*). Thickness of ﬁlms was measured in the
dry state with a Bruker Dektac proﬁlometer.
