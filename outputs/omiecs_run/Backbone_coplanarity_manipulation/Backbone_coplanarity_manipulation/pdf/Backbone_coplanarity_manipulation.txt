The development of high-performance n-type semiconducting
polymers remains a significant challenge. Reported here is the
construction of a coplanar backbone via intramolecular hydrogen
bonds to dramatically enhance the performance of n-type poly-
meric mixed conductors operating in aqueous electrolyte. Specifi-
cally, glycolated naphthalene tetracarboxylicdiimide (gNDI) couples
with vinylene and thiophene to give gNDI-V and gNDI-T, respec-
tively. The hydrogen bonding functionalities are fused to the back-
bone to ensure a more coplanar backbone and much tighter p–p
stacking of gNDI-V than gNDI-T, which is evidenced by density
functional theory simulations and grazing-incidence wide-angle
X-ray scattering. Importantly, these copolymers are fabricated as
the active layer of the aqueous-based electrochromic devices and
organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). gNDI-V exhibits a
larger electrochromic contrast (DT = 30%) and a higher coloration
efficiency (1988 cm2 C1) than gNDI-T owing to its more efficient
ionic–electronic coupling. Moreover, gNDI-V gives the highest
electron mobility (0.014 cm2 V1 s1) and lC* (2.31 FV1 cm1 s1)
reported to date for NDI-based copolymers in OECTs, attributed to
the improved thin-film crystallinity and molecular packing pro-
moted by hydrogen bonds. Overall, this work marks a remarkable
advance in the n-type polymeric mixed conductors and the hydro-
gen bond functionalization strategy opens up an avenue to access
desirable performance metrics for aqueous-based electrochemical
devices.
1. Introduction
Organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs) are often
conjugated polymers (CPs), and can simultaneously transport
ionic and electronic species.1,2 CPs are a perfect candidate for
mixed conduction: a conjugated backbone supports the charge
transport and the ionic transport is allowed through the
bulk.3,4 More importantly, the desired properties can be facilely
introduced to CPs via chemical modifications.5,6 Based on
these advantages, there has been growing interest in develop-
ing CPs which can be reversibly doped and de-doped with
aqueous electrolyte.7,8 As reported, an aqueous-based electro-
lyte possesses high ionic conductivity, incombustibility and
non-toxicity, which makes it a promising alternative to an

New concepts
In recent years, considerable eﬀorts have been put into designing poly-
meric mixed ionic–electronic conductors (PMIECs), as they are key to
advancing a host of technological developments for electrochemical
devices. However, the development of high-performance n-type PMIECs
remains a significant challenge. While extensive research has gone into
introducing novel building blocks or diverse hydrophilic pendant chains
(e.g., butylene glycol) to maximize the performance of n-type PMIECs
operating in aqueous electrolyte, little work has thus far been conducted
on tailoring the molecular packing and electronic properties through
conformational control using intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Herein, we
report the very first high performance n-type PMIECs developed by
backbone coplanarity manipulation via hydrogen bonds, which were
fabricated
as
aqueous-based
electrochromic
devices
and
organic
electrochemical transistors. In particular, the more coplanar backbone
conformation driven by intermolecular hydrogen bonds results in a much
higher device performance in both aqueous-based devices. Importantly,
the first demonstration of backbone coplanarity control via hydrogen
bonding promises to expand our understanding of the effect of backbone
conformation on ionic–electronic coupling and mixed conduction in
aqueous media. We envisage our systematic work will inspire researchers
from diverse backgrounds to design future n-type PMIECs to promote
their developments for application in next-generation bioelectronics,
optoelectronics and batteries.

organic electrolyte.9,10 Therefore, CPs operating in aqueous
electrolyte possess much potential to fabricate as active materials
to develop non-toxic and environment-friendly electrochemical
devices, such as light-emitting electrochemical cells (LEEC),11
organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)12 and electrochromic
devices (ECDs).13
However, most CPs are hydrophobic which results from
their hydrophobic alkyl side chains and conjugated back-
bones.14,15 Introducing hydrophilic oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG)
as side chains is a prevailing method to promote the ionic
conductivity of CPs in aqueous electrolyte and provide suﬃcient
solubility in organic solvents for solution processing.16–18
Generally, the CPs as OMIECs can be classified as p-type and
n-type.19,20 Compared to the well-developed p-type OMIECs,
the development of n-type OMIECs is relatively slow.21,22
Whereas the n-type OMIECs are highly essential as electron-
transporting materials for realizing p–n-junction-based wear-
able, flexible or printable electrochemical devices,23 such as
low-power OECT-based complementary circuits for bioelectro-
nic applications,24 thus it is indispensable and imperative to
develop high-performance n-type polymeric mixed conductors.
However, compared with p-type OMIECs, the n-type OMIECs
more easily suffer from the issue of ‘‘nonplanar backbones’’.25,26
This is attributed to the electron-withdrawing groups (such
as CQO or CRN), which enable the n-type charge transport
properties, are often bulky and likely induce a steric hindrance on
their adjacent subunits.27 Furthermore, such steric hindrance may
potentially result in a highly twisted backbone, which would
shorten the coherent conjugation length and inhibit the interchain
carrier transport, thus limiting the transport of charge carriers
with respect of electrochemical application.28,29
One promising approach to address the aforementioned
‘‘nonplanar backbone’’ issue of the n-type OMIECs is the
employment of noncovalent bonds to construct coplanar
conformation.30,31 Among various types of noncovalent inter-
actions, the hydrogen bond works as an ideal interaction owing
to its tunable strength, directional nature and synthetic
versatility
which
allow
for
precise
control
of
backbone
conformation.32–34 The noncovalent conformational lock effect
driven by hydrogen bonds can be viewed as high energy barriers
which prevent the low energy coplanar conformer from tor-
sional rotation, contributed by the formation of noncovalent
interactions.28 Much research has reported intriguing proper-
ties which were induced by the coplanar conformation, such as
anisotropic molecular aggregation and solvent resistance.35
Moreover, a coplanar backbone is expected to possess effective
coherent conjugation along the backbone and provide faster
intramolecular charge transport.35,36 Additionally, coplanarity
conformation favors small reorganization energy through
charge transport and close intermolecular packing, which
would result in strong intermolecular electronic coupling and
long exciton diffusion length.36 Despite the potential of the
hydrogen bond functionalization, especially rare are works
reporting the performance enhancement of n-type polymeric
mixed conductors operating in aqueous media through back-
bone coplanarity manipulation by hydrogen bonds.
Naphthalenediimide (NDI) has been well utilized as a robust
building block for n-type OMIECs and NDI groups have high
thermal and oxidative stability.37,38 The strongly electron-
deficient aromatic unit with two electron-withdrawing imide
groups gives low-lying LUMO energy levels, which makes NDI-
based CPs excellent electron-transporting semiconductors.39,40
Besides, NDI-based copolymers usually exhibit good long-term
operational stability in water, which is critical for practical
aqueous-based applications.41,42 Additionally, much potential
was found in NDI-based copolymers as electrochromic dis-
plays and energy storage devices, which can be used as a
platform for varied aqueous-based electrochemical devices.16
However, the carbonyl groups in the NDI core often cause a
strong steric hindrance with the adjacent units and a twisted
backbone conformation,43,44 consequently resulting in loca-
lized polaron and limited carrier transport.45,46 For instance,
our previous work investigated glycolated NDI coupling with
bithiophene to give gNDI-BT, which was fabricated as a
channel material in OECTs.16 It was found that gNDI-BT
exhibited a highly twisted backbone and relatively large
dihedral angles (y) up to 441, which was evidenced by density
functional
theory
(DFT)
calculations.
Furthermore,
DFT
computations
revealed
that
the
twists
mainly
occurred
between the NDI core and the adjacent thienyl groups. As a
consequence, less ordered molecular packing was found
and gNDI-BT presented a low electron mobility of 5.69 
104 cm2 V1 s1 in OECTs.
Inspired by the potential of hydrogen bond functionaliza-
tion to construct a coplanar backbone conformation, the mole-
cular structure–device property correlation for n-type OMIECs
operating in aqueous media has been systematically investi-
gated. NDI was employed as an acceptor unit in this work,
coupling with vinylene and thiophene to give gNDI-V and
gNDI-T, respectively. DFT simulations support that the gNDI-V
displays a coplanar backbone conformation owing to intra-
molecular hydrogen bonds, while gNDI-T exhibits a highly
twisted backbone without an intermolecular hydrogen bond.
Furthermore, gNDI-V exhibited much shorter p–p stacking
(3.59 Å) than gNDI-T (3.97 Å). The relationship between poly-
meric structure and device properties has been established
by systemically comparing the NDI copolymers’ optical and
electronic properties, electrochemical charging behavior and
spectroelectrochemical properties, molecular packing, as well
as a range of electrochemical device performances (ECDs and
OECTs). It was observed that gNDI-V gave superior device
performances than gNDI-T, including greater electrochromic
contrast
and
composite
coloration
efficiency
as
ECDs.
Compared to gNDI-T, the OECTs based on gNDI-V exhibit an
impressive electron mobility of 0.014 cm2 V1 s1 and an
excellent mC* value of 2.31 F V1 cm1 s1, which are both
the highest values reported to date for NDI-based OMIECs.
Therefore, the proposed hydrogen bond functionalization will
inspire future molecular design and varied n-type copolymers
can be optimized by this design principle to access desir-
able performance metrics in aqueous-based electrochemical
devices.

2. Results and discussion
2.1
NDI-based copolymers synthesis
Two NDI-based copolymers synthesized in this work are illu-
strated in Scheme 1. The synthetic procedures for the mono-
mers and copolymers are described in Schemes S1 and S2
(ESI†). The six OEG repeating units were utilized to provide
the NDI-based copolymers with essential ionic conductivity in
aqueous media and high solubility in organic solvents for
solution processing. The gNDI for the polymerization was
synthesized according to our previous report.16 The trans-1, 2-
bis(tributylstannyl)ethene
and
2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thio-
phene were both commercially available. Under typical Stille
polymerization conditions, the gNDI monomer was polymer-
ized with the two forementioned monomers to give gNDI-T and
gNDI-V in high yields. Specifically, gNDI-T and gNDI-V are both
insoluble in aqueous media, which allows characterization of
their device properties in aqueous electrolyte. In addition, the two
copolymers both exhibited good solution processability with
adequate solubility (equal to or above 20 mg mL1) in common
organic solvents, such as chloroform and dichloromethane.
The molecular weights of gNDI-T and gNDI-V were evaluated by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-
TOF) mass spectrometry, exhibiting the maximum molecular
weights between 16.3 and 17.2 kDa, corresponding to the repeat-
ing units of 19 (Fig. S7, ESI†). The number-average molecular
weights (Mn) for the two copolymers were also determined by gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) and the Mn was in the range
between 11.0 and 15.9 kDa (Fig. S8, ESI†), which was in accor-
dance with the MALDI-TOF data. Their thermal properties were
characterized by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), showing
good thermal stabilities with a decomposition temperature over
290 1C for both copolymers (Fig. S9, ESI†).
2.2
Optical and electronic properties
The optical properties of NDI-based copolymers were measured
by UV-vis-NIR absorption measurement and the corresponding
data are summarized in Table 1. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, all the
absorption spectra exhibited similar absorption profiles with
dual-band absorption, an absorption band in the high energy
range (309–445 nm) attributed to the p–p* transition and a
low energy (422–746 nm) band which originated from the
intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).47 In the solution, an
absorption maximum (lmax) of low energy band located at
520 nm and 544 nm was recorded for gNDI-V and gNDI-T,
respectively. By monitoring the film absorption spectra, the
lmax of gNDI-V and gNDI-T presented an apparent red-shift
compared with their solution absorption, suggesting improved
molecular packing in solid states.48 Note that the absorption
maximum (lmax) shifts significantly from 532 nm for gNDI-V to
623 nm for gNDI-T. The red shift was likely due to the stronger
electron-donating ability of the thiophene unit than that of the
vinylene unit, which is evidenced by the later cyclic voltamme-
try (CV) measurements and density functional theory (DFT)
simulations. The optical bandgaps (Eopt
g ) were obtained from
the film absorption onsets, and the values are 1.73 eV for gNDI-T
and 2.01 eV for gNDI-V. The lower bandgap of gNDI-T is attributed
to the relatively stronger ICT character between the NDI and the
thiophene unit.49
To evaluate the electrochemical properties of the NDI-based
copolymers, CV measurements were performed in aceto-
nitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate
(n-Bu4NPF6) using Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. As illu-
strated in Fig. 1b, the reduction onset potential in acetonitrile
of gNDI-T and gNDI-V was 0.21 V and 0.02 V, respectively.
Then, the corresponding lowest unoccupied molecular orbital

(LUMO) energy levels (ELUMO) were calculated as 4.21 eV for
gNDI-T and 4.40 eV for gNDI-V. Notably, gNDI-T and gNDI-V
both present low-lying LUMO (o4.02 eV), which has favorable
energetics to avoid the electron trapping by water and
oxygen.50,51 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
energy level (EHOMO) was obtained by using ELUMO subtracting
an optical band gap (Eopt
g ) to give the value of 5.94 eV for
gNDI-T and 6.43 eV for gNDI-V. According to the literature, for
NDI-based copolymers, the ELUMO is dominantly influenced by
the NDI contribution while the EHOMO is sensitive to the relative
electron-donating strength of donor units.52,53 A significant
increase in the EHOMO changing from vinylene to thiophene is
observed, which indicates the destabilization of EHOMO with
increasing electron donating strength.54
2.3
Coplanar backbone conformation analysis
To gain an insight into the backbone geometries and electronic
structures, DFT by Gaussian 09 with the level of B3LYP/6-31G(d)
was carried out. The OEG side chains were simplified as the
methyl group. The optimized backbone geometry and frontier
molecular orbitals of both trimers are presented in Fig. 2a and
c. First, the gNDI-V trimer presents a more coplanar backbone
geometry than the gNDI-T trimer from the side view. Besides,
for the gNDI-V trimer, the distance between the O atom

(the carbonyl of NDI) and the H atom (vinylene) is 2.18 Å, much
shorter than the sum of the O and H van der Waals radii of
2.50 Å,55,56 which indicates the presence of the O  H hydrogen
bond, contributing to the reduction in the conformational
disorder by locking the rotating single bond. However, the
gNDI-T trimer indicates the distance between the O atom (the
carbonyl of NDI) and H atom (thiophene) is 2.58 Å, larger than
the sum of the O and H van der Waals radii, suggesting the
absence of O  H noncovalent interactions. As a consequence,
the gNDI-V trimer displays a coplanar backbone conformation
with a dihedral angle around 351 between the NDI and the
adjacent vinylene, while a more twisted backbone with a
dihedral angle around 501 between the NDI and thiophene is
found for the gNDI-T trimer. In addition, Fig. 2b illustrates the
torsion energy for both trimers and it is found that the gNDI-V
trimer gives a larger torsion energy barrier (B0.69 eV) than the
gNDI-T trimer (B0.12 eV), enabling the gNDI-V trimer to have a
more rigid backbone, since the hydrogen bond works as a non-
bonding conformational lock.43 Furthermore, the coplanar back-
bone would potentially prolong the coherent conjugation length
and enhance interchain charge carrier transport.57 Besides, the
visualization of LUMOs and HOMOs is shown in Fig. 2c. The two
trimers revealed localized electronic structures: the donor units
contribute mainly to the HOMOs while the LUMOs are highly
localized on electron deficient NDI. The calculated ELUMO/EHOMO
of gNDI-V (3.61/6.22 eV) was deeper than that of gNDI-T
(3.53/5.89 eV), which was consistent with the CV measurement
results. Similarly, the increased EHOMO in gNDI-T calculated from
DFT simulations indicate the stronger electron-donating ability of
the thiophene unit. Moreover, the DFT computation results reveal
that the hydrogen bond functionalities finely modulate the n-type
conjugated backbone conformation.
2.4
Microstructure study
To further study the eﬀect of the hydrogen bond on polymer
packing orientation, the NDI-based copolymer thin-film microstruc-
tures were analyzed by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
(GIWAXS). The GIWAXS characteristics of both copolymers are
shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding parameters are summarized
in Table S1 (ESI†). The gNDI-V displayed a strong (010) scattering
peak in the out-of-plane direction while the gNDI-T concurrently
showed lamellar scattering (100) peaks in the out-of-plane direction
and a p–p stacking (010) peak in both the out-of-plane and in-plane
direction, suggesting that the gNDI-V presented a predominant face-
on orientation and the gNDI-T exhibited a mixed face-on/edge-on
orientation. Fig. 3c shows a comparison of the p–p stacking distance
and paracrystalline disorder in p–p stacking direction for both
copolymers. It is found that the p–p stacking distance sharply
decreased from 3.97 Å for gNDI-T to 3.59 Å for gNDI-V. The closer
intermolecular packing in the solid state of gNDI-V likely results
from its coplanar backbone conformation.55 Additionally, the
paracrystalline disorder parameter, strongly correlating with elec-
trical conductivity, was calculated according to eqn (1)58

where the FWHM presents a diffraction peak full width at half-
maximum, and q is the diffraction peak position. The para-
crystalline disorder of p-stacking direction g(010) calculated
from this equation decreased from 0.21 for gNDI-T to 0.19 for
gNDI-V, and a decrease in g(010) indicates the hopping transfer
integral and conductivity enhancement.59 Together with the
much shorter p–p spacing and lower paracrystalline disorder in
gNDI-V, we believe the manipulation of backbone coplanarity
via the introduction of hydrogen bonding can improve the
thin-film crystallinity and bring more favorable molecular
packing to facilitate charge transport. Moreover, to analyze
the microstructure features of polymer films upon electro-
chemical doping, we collected GIWAXS of the films in their
reduced condition (see Fig. S10 and Table S2, ESI†). Compared
with the pristine state, there were no obvious film microstruc-
ture changes in the reduced state for both NDI-based copoly-
mers, which indicates a good operation stability in aqueous
electrolytes.60
2.5
Electrochemical charging with aqueous electrolyte
To investigate the electrochemical redox behavior, CV measure-
ment of polymer thin films in 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution at a
scan rate of 100 mV s1 was conducted (see Fig. 4). The
reduction onset potential of the copolymers in aqueous media
was 0.13 V for gNDI-T and 0.06 V for gNDI-V (Fig. S11, ESI†).
However, the reduction onset potential in organic electrolyte
(acetonitrile) was 0.21 V for gNDI-T and 0.02 V for gNDI-V.
A shift in the onset of reduction towards more positive poten-
tials for both copolymers was observed when switching from an
organic electrolyte to aqueous electrolyte, and similar results
have been reported for our previous NDI-based copolymers.16
The reduction onset potential shift is attributed to changes in
both the size and charge density of the counter cations and
diﬀerences in the solute–solvent interactions between the
polymer and the supporting electrolyte.61 The highly hydro-
philic OEG side chains were introduced to NDI copolymers,
allowing for efficient ionic species transport in aqueous
media.62 Compared with acetonitrile, the stronger interactions
between OEG side chains and water will lead to favorable K+
penetration into the polymer film to stabilize the negative
charge on the polymer backbone during reduction. Although
gNDI-V (4.40 eV) presents lower LUMO energy levels than
gNDI-T (4.21 eV), a more positive reduction onset potential
in aqueous media was found in gNDI-T (0.13 V) than gNDI-V
(0.06 V). According to the literature, the more positive reduction
onset potential found in gNDI-T is due to its less ordered
molecular packing, which is expected to facilitate ion penetra-
tion into the polymer bulk.49,63,64

To evaluate the electrochemical stability, the copolymer
films were continuously charged for 150 cycles in Fig. 4a
andb. As in previous discussions, the gNDI-T exhibits a more
positive reduction onset potential which indicates gNDI-T
would reach a higher doping level than gNDI-V during the
same potential window (0.65 V to 0.65 V). A lower charging
stability was found for gNDI-T than gNDI-V during the same
potential window (0.65 V to 0.65 V) (Fig. S12, ESI†), which was
likely due to its instability at a higher doping level.16 Then, a
narrower potential window (0.50 V to 0.50 V) was applied and
the charging stability was significantly improved for gNDI-T.
Notably, the larger charging window (0.65 V to 0.65 V) found
in gNDI-V results from its ordered molecular packing, which
benefits from its coplanar backbone conformation. In addition
to the electrochemical stability, the redox kinetics of polymer
films in aqueous electrolyte was studied as well. CV measure-
ments of copolymers in 0.1 M KCl aqueous solution from
0.65 V to 0.65 V for gNDI-V and from 0.50 V to 0.50 V for
gNDI-T at a scan rate from 10 mV s1 to 1000 mV s1 were
carried out (Fig. S13, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the linear
trend of relationship between current intensity and square root
of scan rate has been shown in both copolymers, which reveals
a
diﬀusion-controlled

Electrochromic properties
To investigate the electrochemical doping mechanism of NDI-
based copolymers in aqueous electrolyte, we conducted spec-
troelectrochemical
measurements
of
the
thin
films
and
monitored their absorption spectra changes during the cycling
in Fig. 5a. Similar absorption spectra changes for gNDI-V and
gNDI-T were observed. Note that the evolution of a new
absorption (620–900 nm) and loss in the intensity of the ICT
band (450–650 nm) were observed within the voltage range
from 0.1 V to 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl, indicating the formation of the
polaron.66 In addition, the polaron formation is also observed
when a voltage pulse is applied as shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†),
where the difference plots were obtained by subtracting the
pristine absorption spectrum (0.1 V) from the electrochemically
doped ones. A quantitative way to evaluate the electrochemical
doping efficiency is shown in Fig. 5b, where the integral of the
polaron absorption (620–900 nm) and the ICT absorption band
(450–650 nm) were plotted versus the applied voltage.67 From
0.1 V to 0.2 V, similar slopes in the polaron and ICT absorp-
tion band were found. However, from 0.2 V to 0.7 V, a higher
slope was found in gNDI-V than gNDI-T, which indicates the
higher magnitude of ionic–electronic coupling in gNDI-V.67
Furthermore, electrochromic behavior during spectroelec-
trochemical measurements was found for the two copolymers
and the electrochromic behavior was studied in Fig. 5c and the
corresponding data is summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). To study
the kinetics of the electrochromic switching process, the films
of NDI-based copolymers were investigated via chronoabsorp-
tiometry on films spin cast onto ITO/glass. The transmittance
of the thin films was monitored by applying sequential square
wave bias pulses, which switched the film between 0.1 V and
0.7 V. gNDI-V exhibited a higher electrochromic contrast
(DT = 30%) than gNDI-T (DT = 19%). Besides, a faster coloration
(Tc, 0.4 s) and bleaching time (Tb, 0.4 s) of gNDI-V was found
compared with gNDI-T (Tc, 1.5 s, Tb, 0.4 s). Moreover, both NDI-
based copolymers showed good long-term switching stability
with less than 2% drop in coloration contrast after switching

for 1200 s. In addition, since the ideal electrochromic material
displays a large transmittance change with a small amount of
charge, the composite coloration eﬃciency (CCE, Z) was used to
evaluate the power eﬃciency during the electrochromic switch-
ing process, and calculated as eqn (2)68
Z ¼ DOD
DQ ¼ logðTbl=TcoÞ
DQ
(2)
where DOD is the change in optical density defined by the
logarithm of the ratio between the transmittance at the
bleached state (Tbl) and the colored state (Tco) and DQ presents
the injected charge per unit area. Fig. S15 (ESI†) shows plots of
DOD as a function of DQ for the electrochromic devices (ECDs)
based on gNDI-V and gNDI-T, from which the Z values were
obtained from the linear slopes. The composite coloration
eﬃciency of gNDI-V (1988 cm2 C1) was much higher than that
of gNDI-T (391 cm2 C1), which was in accordance with the
electrochemical doping eﬃciency found in spectroelectrochem-
ical measurements. Specifically, the higher electrochemical
doping eﬃciency and CCE were attributed to the higher mag-
nitude of ionic–electronic coupling in gNDI-V thin film owing
to the coplanar backbone conformation and favorable molecu-
lar packing which facilate ion–electron transport. Moreover,
gNDI-V exhibited an impressive electrochromic performance
compared with those state-of-the-art copolymer-based ECDs
(Table S3, ESI†).
2.7
OECTs performance
To investigate the mixed ionic–electronic transport properties
of NDI-based copolymers, gNDI-V and gNDI-T were studied as
channel materials by fabricating OECTs. The key figure of
merit, transconductance gm, at saturation conditions for OECTs
is obtained from eqn (3):69
gm ¼ Wd
L mCðVTH  VGÞ
(3)
where VG is the gate voltage and VTH is the threshold voltage; W
presents the channel width, d and L are the channel depth and
the channel length, respectively; m is the charge-carrier mobility
and C* presents the volume capacitance. The value of mC* is
used for evaluating the ionic–electronic conduction properties
of the channel materials. The detailed OECT parameters for
both NDI-based copolymers were summarized in Table 2 and
Table S4 (ESI†).
gNDI-V with more coplanar backbone conformation driven
by intramolecular hydrogen bonding exhibited higher device
performance than gNDI-T. gNDI-V reached a maximum drain
current of 2.82 mA (VG = 0.65 V), which is more than 4-fold
higher than gNDI-T (0.62 mA, VG = 0.50 V) at the same VD = 0.4 V
(see Fig. 6a and b). Note that the maximum drain current found
for gNDI-T was at VG = 0.50 V and VD = 0.4 V. As for the
normalized transconductance, gm,norm in Fig. 6c and d, gNDI-V
also
gives
a
higher
value
(0.42
S
cm1)
than
gNDI-T
(0.11 S cm1). Additionally, the window width of the hysteresis
of gNDI-V (17 mV) is larger than gNDI-T (9 mV), indicating
easier ion diﬀusion in gNDI-T.70 As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†),
the threshold voltage (VTH) is 0.30 V for gNDI-V and 0.20 V for
gNDI-T, which is in accordance with the trend of the reduction
onset observed from CV curves in aqueous media.
To systematically investigate the response time, the on/oﬀ-
time constant (ton/toﬀ) was provided in Fig. S17 (ESI†). Addi-
tionally, for the analyte-responsive sensor, their response times
are usually recorded at 90% of the saturation values. The rise/
fall (Ton,90%/Toﬀ,90%) response times were obtained by measur-
ing the time it takes for the channel current (IDS) to reach 90%
of its maximum and minimum value. To eliminate the thick-
ness eﬀects,71 the response time was normalized by channel
geometry (tnorm = t/(d(WL)1/2) and Tnorm,90% = T/(d(WL)1/2))
according to the literature.72 A normalized response time
ton, norm/toﬀ, norm of 2.90/0.32 ms mm2 (Ton, norm,90%/Toﬀ,norm, 90%
of 7.61/0.65 ms mm2) and 0.87/0.18 ms mm2 (Ton,norm,90%/
Toﬀ,norm,90% of 2.33/0.42 ms mm2) was found for gNDI-V and
gNDI-T, respectively. As discussed in the charging behavior
section, the faster response time for gNDI-T is attributed to
its less ordered packing, which facilitates ion penetration into
the polymer bulk. Besides, the asymmetry in the switching
characteristics between the turn-on and turn-oﬀtimes was
found, indicating the presence of a dissipation process, such
as a viscoelastic component in the conducting pathway through
the channel. As reported, the possible processes that aﬀect the
formation of this pathway are (1) the doping of the NDI-based
chains that aﬀect electron density ne and (2) the relaxation of
intrachain conformations and interchain packing that aﬀects
electron mobility me.73,74 In addition, the on-to-oﬀcurrent
ratios measured are in the order of 104–105, which can be
comparable with the reported n-type copolymers.
To understand the volumetric doping process of NDI-based
copolymers, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
technique was used as presented in the Fig. S18 (ESI†).75 The
capacitance was extracted by fitting EIS data via an equivalent
circuit model (Rs (Rp8C)), where the electrolyte resistance is Rs,
and Rp and C present the polymer film’s resistance and film’s
capacitance, respectively.76 gNDI-V exhibited a lower volumetric
capacitance (144 F cm3) than the gNDI-T films (237 F cm3).

Similarly, the larger C* is attributed to the less ordered packing
of gNDI-T, which is expected to facilitate ion penetration into
the polymer bulk. As shown in Fig. 6e, the mC* increased more
than five times going from 0.42 F V1 cm1 s1 for gNDI-T to
2.31 F V1 cm1 s1 for gNDI-V. Furthermore, based on the mC*
and C* values, the electron mobility (m) was obtained. Note
that the two polymers both exhibited a good device repro-
ducibility (see Fig. S19, ESI†). The average m value (1.4 
102 cm2 V1 s1) of gNDI-V is one order of magnitude higher
than that (1.5  103 cm2 V1 s1) of gNDI-T, which benefits
from the favorable molecular packing, originating from the
coplanar backbone conformation driven by hydrogen bond
functionalization. Note that the mC* (2.31 F V1 cm1 s1)
and m (1.4  102 cm2 V1 s1) for gNDI-V are the highest
values reported to date for the NDI-based OECTs (see Table S5,
ESI†), which supports that our hydrogen bond functionaliza-
tion opens up a proposing avenue for designing n-type mixed
polymeric conductors operating in aqueous electrolyte. Long
term on–off switching tests were performed to demonstrate the
stable operation of NDI-based copolymers. The percentage
retention of the initial current was employed to evaluate the
operational stability. As summarized in Fig. S20 (ESI†), both
NDI-based copolymers displayed a long-term stability with
less than 9% current loss after 60 mins. According to the
literature,60 the aqueous stability is dependent on the film
microstructural crystallinity and composition. Compared with
the GIWAXS in the pristine and reduced state, it was found
that the two NDI-based copolymers both retain good film
microstructural crystallinity upon electrochemical doping, which
accounts for the operational stability for the 60 minutes test.
3. Conclusion
In summary, high performance n-type polymeric mixed con-
ductors have been designed and synthesized via manipulating
the coplanar backbone conformation through intramolecular
hydrogen bonds. We find that the coplanar backbone confor-
mation driven by hydrogen bonding not only aﬀects the copo-
lymers’ optical properties, electrochemical redox behavior and
molecular packing, but also remarkably enhances the perfor-
mance of aqueous-based electrochemical devices. gNDI-V
exhibited a larger electrochromic contrast (DT = 30%) and a
higher coloration eﬃciency (1988 cm2 C1) than gNDI-T, which
was due to its better ionic–electronic coupling. As for OECTs,
gNDI-V outperformed gNDI-T, including a higher transconduc-
tance of 0.42 S cm1 and exhibiting the highest value of m
(0.014 cm2 V1 s1) and mC* (2.31 F V1 cm1 s1) for the NDI-
based OECTs, which was attributed to the improved thin-film
crystallinity and molecular packing induced by hydrogen bond-
ing. This systematic work elucidates the mechanism of how
hydrogen bonds promote the desired molecular conformation,
solid-state packing, and electrochemical performances of
n-type semiconducting polymeric materials. Moreover, we
believe the hydrogen-bonding functionalization will provide
rational design guidelines at the molecular level for researchers
