The red arrows indicate charge carrier migration through the film. In the dry state, the annealed film is more crystalline and has a higher mobility compared to the unannealed sample. When hydrated, the unannealed film swells more and takes up more electrolyte solution. The annealed sample swells in both crystalline and amorphous regions. Upon electrochemical doping, a similar number of charges per volume dope both samples. The unannealed sample loses more waters/cations and has a higher mobility than the annealed sample. We attribute this lower mobility in the annealed P3MEEMT to a heterogeneity in film swelling. Amorphous regions between the crystalline regions swell more, decreasing crystalline regions of the film. When the film is hydrated, the swelling in these regions prevents charges carriers from moving as easily between the crystalline regions of the film.",
