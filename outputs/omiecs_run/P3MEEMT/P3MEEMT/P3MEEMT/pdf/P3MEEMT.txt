ABSTRACT: We study poly(3-{[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)eth-
oxy]methyl}thiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3MEEMT), a new poly-
thiophene derivative with ethylene glycol-based side chains, as
a promising semiconducting polymer for accumulation-mode
organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with ﬁgures of
merit comparable to those of state-of-the-art materials. By
characterizing the OECT performance of P3MEEMT
transistors as a function of the anion, we ﬁnd that large
hydrophobic anions lower the threshold voltage. We ﬁnd that,
compared to poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT),
P3MEEMT has faster anion injection rates, which we attribute
to the hydration of the P3MEEMT crystal lattice. We study
P3MEEMT-based OECT and organic ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor
(OFET) performance as a function of ﬁlm crystallinity and show that changing the crystallinity of the polymer by thermal
annealing increases the OFET mobility yet decreases the OECT mobility. We attribute this diﬀerence to the fact that, unlike
OFETs, OECTs operate in aqueous environments. To probe how hydration aﬀects the operation of OECTs, we investigate the
role of water in electrochemical doping using electrochemical quartz microbalance (EQCM) gravimetry. We ﬁnd that steady-
state hydration and hydration dynamics under electrochemical bias diﬀer dramatically between the crystalline and amorphous
P3MEEMT ﬁlms. These results suggest that the presence of water reduces the electronic connectivity between the crystalline
regions of P3MEEMT, thus lowering the mobility in solution. Overall, our study highlights the importance of the role of
polymer hydration and nanoscale morphology in elucidating design principles for OECT operation.
■INTRODUCTION
Conjugated polymers have recently exhibited a surge of new
applications that utilize their mixed electronic/ionic con-
duction properties, including bioelectronics,1−5 thermoelec-
trics,6 electrochromics,7,8 supercapacitors and solid-state
batteries,9−11 neuromorphic computing,12 and all organic
logic circuits.13 Speciﬁcally for bioelectronics, conjugated
polymers have been used for ion pumps in drug delivery,14,15
for highly sensitive analyte-speciﬁc detectors,16−18 and for
recording electrophysiological activity.19 For many of these
bioelectronics applications, organic electrochemical transistors
(OECTs) have emerged as a promising platform for trans-
ducing small changes in ion concentrations to large changes in
electrical current.20 During OECT operation, a gate bias
applied to the solution induces electrochemical doping of the
polymer active layer (i.e., electronic charges are injected from
the substrate into the polymer and ions from solution move
into the polymer matrix to electronically compensate for the
injected electronic charge). This doping process results in the
modulation of the channel conductivity; therefore, the current
between the source and drain electrodes (ID) varies.20−22 In
addition to their use in bioelectronics applications, OECTs also
provide a convenient model platform for studying the mixed
conduction properties of conjugated polymers.
Inal and colleagues recently proposed using the product of
the electronic carrier mobility (μ) and the volumetric
capacitance (C*) as the ﬁgure of merit for the steady-state
eﬃciency of mixed electronic/ionic conductor materials.23 This
value can be extracted from eq 1 by measuring the
transconductance (gm) of OECTs, where the channel width
(W), length (L), and ﬁlm thickness (d) as well as the gate bias
(VG) and threshold voltage (VT) are known.

accumulation-mode OECT materials, a design trade-oﬀ
between the carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance has
been reported.24−26 To a ﬁrst approximation, high electronic
mobility can be viewed as the result of well-ordered, more
crystalline ﬁlm morphology,27 which tends to inhibit bulk ionic
transport and storage. On the other hand, a high C* is achieved
in disordered and highly amorphous ﬁlm morphologies that
allow for high ion mobility but typically poor electronic
mobility.25 Recently, this trade-oﬀwas directly observed by
Giridharagopal et al., showing that ion uptake occurs
preferentially in softer, presumably amorphous regions of a
hydrophobic conjugated polymer ﬁlm.28 Despite the challenge
of balancing electronic and ionic transport properties, a number
of high-performing OECT materials exist today, with μC*
values approaching 300 F cm−1 V−1 s−1.23,29
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate
(PEDOT:PSS) is the most widely used OECT material
because of its commercial availability and high performance
(relatively high μ and moderate C*, resulting in a μC* of 50 F
cm−1 V−1 s−1).23 However, PEDOT:PSS operates in depletion
mode rather than accumulation mode, which is undesirable for
some applications because of the poor on/oﬀratio at low bias.
Additionally, composite systems such as PEDOT:PSS lack the
synthetic ﬂexibility of a single-phase system and can exhibit a
lower maximum capacitance (though composites may confer
other advantages). As a result, there is currently much interest
in developing new single-phase polymers that operate in
accumulation mode. Much of the work aimed at developing
new accumulation mode materials has focused on side-chain
engineering for more eﬃcient ion uptake and transport. Early
work on electrolyte-gated organic transistors showed that
carboxylic acid-capped side chains resulted in signiﬁcantly
higher transistor currents compared to the alkyl side chain
analogue in both solid polyelectrolyte30 and aqueous environ-
ments.31 Further work on aqueous electrolyte-gated organic
transistors showed that increasing the fraction of alcohol-
capped side chains versus alkyl side chains results in both faster
and a greater magnitude of ion uptake.32 These results were
largely attributed to the more hydrophilic polymer, leading to
more facile ion uptake within the bulk of the ﬁlm. More
recently, ethylene glycol-based side-chain polymers have shown
very promising ion uptake and transport properties in both p-
type and n-type polymers in aqueous electrolytes. OECT
performance enhancement using oligoethylene glycol side
chains is generalizable to a number of diﬀerent conjugated
backbones, including polythiophene,33 benzodithiophene,34
propylenedioxythiophenes,35 and bithiophene−thieno-
thiophene.29 Additionally, ethylene glycol side chains have
been shown to increase the OECT performance compared to
that of their alkyl analogues in n-type polymers based on
naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimide.36,37 In each of these
instances, the presence of ethylene glycol side chains improves
both the steady-state characteristics (transconductance) and
the switching kinetics of OECTs. Well-designed polymers now
function as single-phase, accumulation-mode OECTs with
volumetric capacitances approaching the theoretical limit of
approximately 400 F cm−3 in aqueous environments.38,39
Although side-chain engineering in accumulation-mode
OECTs has greatly increased volumetric capacitances,40
many of these molecularly designed polymers still suﬀer from
low mobilities.23 Decades of research into organic ﬁeld-eﬀect
transistors (OFETs) have yielded clear design rules for
improving electronic mobility in dry polymers: (1) minimizing
the energy disorder along the polymer chain by designing a
rigid, planar conjugated backbone that maximizes orbital
overlap with adjacent chains and (2) ensuring nanoscale
morphology that results in well-connected crystalline do-
mains.41 For many OFET polymers, thermal annealing is used
to increase the crystallinity and therefore the electronic
mobility.42−44 Unlike OFETs, OECTs operate in an aqueous
environment, and it is therefore unclear whether increased
crystallinity will impact the mobility the same way when the
polymer is hydrated. It is important to note that none of the
ethylene glycol side-chain polymers reported to date have been
annealed at suﬃciently high temperatures to cause signiﬁcant
polymer reorganization.29,33,35,37 To establish design rules for
optimizing the mobility of OECTs, there is thus the need for an
updated understanding of electronic transport in hydrated
polymer systems to account for the interactions between the
polymer, the polymer morphology, the solvent (water in the
case of bioelectronics), and the dopant ion. The importance of
such interactions is highlighted by recent papers where the
OECT performance depends on the identity of the dopant ion
and its hydration shell.45,46 Recent work also examined the role
of water in the electronic transport properties and found
reduced mobility in a more hydrated ﬁlm.47−49 As the number
of applications that require mixed electronic/ionic conducting
materials continues to grow, updated material design rules will
be extremely important.
Here, we report the synthesis and performance of poly(3-
{[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]methyl}thiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3MEEMT), a new high-eﬃciency material for OECTs with
ethylene glycol-based side chains that has μC* = 49.1 ± 5.0 F
cm−1 V−1 s−1 in 100 mM KCl, comparable to state-of-the-art
OECT active-layer materials.23 We use P3MEEMT as a model
system to investigate how the side chain impacts OECT
performance and anion injection and compare its electro-
chemical doping properties to those of poly(3-hexylthiophene-
2,5-diyl) (P3HT), a similar polythiophene derivative with alkyl-
based side chains. We ﬁnd a similar anion-dependent threshold
voltage shift in P3MEEMT as previously observed in P3HT.45
We also ﬁnd that the anion injection kinetics are much faster in
P3MEEMT than in P3HT and depend less on the anion
identity. We propose that the origin of the diﬀerence in doping
kinetics between P3MEEMT and P3HT stems from how water
aﬀects the crystal structure of each material. Using grazing
incidence X-ray diﬀraction (GIXRD), we ﬁnd that the crystal
lattice of P3MEEMT readily expands and hydrates in solution,
allowing ions to move readily throughout the material, whereas
the crystal lattice of P3HT expands to accommodate the
charge-compensating anions only upon electrochemically
driven ion injection.
In addition, we investigate how the degree of crystallinity
impacts the P3MEEMT OECT performance. Surprisingly, we
ﬁnd that highly crystalline P3MEEMT has a lower OECT
mobility compared to that of amorphous P3MEEMT, yet the
OFETs fabricated with P3MEEMT show the reverse trend: the
mobility is much higher for crystalline P3MEEMT than for
amorphous P3MEEMT. We attribute these diﬀerences in
OECT mobility to the eﬀect of hydration on the connectivity
of crystalline domains within the ﬁlm. Using electrochemical
quartz crystal microbalance gravimetry (E-QCM), we ﬁnd that
the amorphous P3MEEMT ﬁlm swells more upon hydration
and expels more water upon electrochemical doping than does
crystalline P3MEEMT. Although crystalline P3MEEMT swells
less, we hypothesize that the swelling that does occur disrupts

percolation pathways between crystalline regions and signiﬁ-
cantly lowers the OECT mobility. We support this hypothesis
with photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) of doped
P3MEEMT and ﬁnd a higher degree of dopant heterogeneity
in the crystalline ﬁlm. This observation points to potentially
disconnected regions in the crystalline ﬁlm that, when
hydrated, lower the overall mobility.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
P3MEEMT OECT Device Performance and Anion
Dependence. Figure 1A shows the molecular structures of
P3MEEMT and P3HT. Both polymers have the same
polythiophene backbone, but P3MEEMT has ethylene glycol-
based side chains and P3HT has alkyl side chains. Polymer
synthesis is described in the Supporting Information, and
Figure S1 shows the 1H NMR spectrum. Figure 1B shows the
geometry used for device testing. Brieﬂy, ﬂexible poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) substrates were prepatterned with
transistor electrodes of varying dimensions, and the polymer
active layer was then deposited, followed by the application of
an insulating masking layer. Figure 1C shows transfer curves
(representative output curves shown in Figure S2) for an
OECT with a P3MEEMT active layer in both 0.1 M potassium
chloride (KCl) and 0.1 M potassium hexaﬂuorophosphate
(KPF6) electrolytes. The maximum current (light-blue line)
achieved within the potential window is 5 times higher in KPF6
than in KCl (light-red line), resulting in a signiﬁcantly higher
transconductance (dotted lines) in KPF6. We attribute much of
this diﬀerence to a 126 ± 25 mV decrease in the threshold
voltage in KPF6 compared to that in KCl (Figure S3). We use
the oxidation of ferrocene to verify that the observed shift in
threshold voltage is largely due to more facile oxidation of the
polymer in KPF6, not to diﬀerences in the potential of the gate
electrode (Figure S4). This behavior follows the same trend as
previously observed in hydrophobic P3HT45 and in the record
mixed conductor, p(g2T-TT).46 Together these results point
to an anion-dependent threshold voltage shift as a general
principle of OECT operation, regardless of the hydrophilicity
of the polymer. In general, larger, more polarizable anions with
a lower surface charge density require a smaller driving force for
injection into the semiconducting polymer. This phenomenon
could stem from competition between ion hydration and
semiconductor polymer doping, as the observed trend for
doping appears to follow the Hofmeister series.50 More
chaotropic ions tend to dope the polymer more easily than
more kosmotropic ions in both P3MEEMT and P3HT. It is
worth noting that the hydrolysis of certain polyatomic anions
can decrease the pH of the solution and have a strong eﬀect on
the polymer doping.46 However, we do not measure signiﬁcant
acid formation, and control experiments indicate that the small
pH diﬀerence between KPF6 and KCl does not result in a large
shift in oxidation potential (Figure S5).
To determine the μC* product of P3MEEMT, we use eq 1,
which relates the measured transconductance to μC*, junction
dimensions, polymer thickness, threshold voltage, and operat-
ing voltage. By plotting the transconductance measured on a
variety of transistor geometries against these geometric
parameters, we can solve for μC*, as shown in Figure 1D. In
100 mM KCl, we obtain a μC* value of 49.1 ± 5.0 F cm−1 V−1
s−1. This μC* is similar to that reported for typical
PEDOT:PSS23 and 5 times greater than that of P3HT (μC*
= 10.4 ± 3.1 F cm−1 V−1 s−1) (Figure S6). To ensure that our
values of μC* are consistent with previously established OECT
benchmarks, we compare our devices to the lithographically
deﬁned parylene peel-oﬀmethod of Malliaras et al.25 (Figure
S7) and ﬁnd that our measured μC* matches at high gate biases
(Vg ≤−0.5 V). This relatively high μC* of P3MEEMT places it
among the best-performing OECT materials, while its
similarity in structure to P3HT allows us to directly explore
how the side chain aﬀects the OECT device performance. The
blue line in Figure 1D shows the μC* when the devices are
tested in 100 mM KPF6, resulting in an even higher μC* of
96.7 ± 10.2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1. We measure the volumetric
capacitance of P3MEEMT ﬁlms in both electrolytes by
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and ﬁnd that
C* nearly doubles to 294 F cm−3 in KPF6 compared to in KCl

(C* ≈175 F cm−3 in KCl) (Figure S8). Therefore, we attribute
the increase in μC* upon changing the ion type almost entirely
to an increase in capacitance, implying that the electronic
carrier mobility is less dependent on the identity of the dopant,
at least at the highest doping levels, consistent with previous
reports.45 This result also suggests that, within the electro-
chemical window of water, approximately twice as many sites
are available for doping when using PF6
−anions as when using
Cl−. The maximum theoretical capacitance for this polymer is
approximately 400 F cm−3,39 so we conclude that in PF6
−most
of the possible sites for charge storage are occupied at a gate
bias of 0.7 V.
P3HT and P3MEEMT Doping Kinetics. We next
investigate how the polymer side chain and anion aﬀect charge
injection kinetics. Figure 2A shows how the absorption
spectrum changes over time with electrochemical doping
using spectroelectrochemistry for P3HT and P3MEEMT with
either Cl−or PF6
−as the anion (VG = 0.7 V and 0.5 s between
spectra). In all cases, the magnitude of the main absorption
peak decreases with time, and a red-shifted polaron peak grows
in. For both P3MEEMT and P3HT, using PF6
−as the anion
results in a larger decrease in the main absorption peak and a
larger increase in the polaron peak, indicating a higher degree
of doping compared to using Cl−
, consistent with our C*
measurements and device data above. Additionally, doping
kinetics in P3MEEMT with both anions is approximately 150
times faster than those of P3HT.
Figure 2B plots the decrease in absorption of the main
absorption peak for P3HT and P3MEEMT for both anions as a
function of time and the corresponding biexponential ﬁts.
Here, we account for the threshold voltage shift between the
Cl−and PF6
−anions by comparing doping kinetics measured at
0.7 V for Cl−and 0.5 V for PF6
−. Even after accounting for this
diﬀerence, the doping kinetics in P3HT are ∼15 times slower
for Cl−(145.3 ± 2.1 s) than for PF6
−(10.4 ± 3.1 s). However,
we observe more similar doping kinetics between Cl−(0.82 ±
0.03 s) and PF6
−(0.71 ± 0.02 s) in P3MEEMT, although
doping with PF6
−is still slightly faster. We observe similar
results if we compare ion injection kinetics at 0.5 V for
P3MEEMT and 0.7 V for P3HT (Figure S9). The
spectroelectrochemistry results suggest that the speed of
electrochemical doping depends strongly on the side-chain
chemistry. The ethylene glycol-based side chains allow ions to
inject much faster into the ﬁlm than the alkyl side chains,
presumably because of the hydrophilic nature of the ethylene
glycol-containing polymer. Additionally, although the time
scale of ion injection depends on the anion in P3HT, the
choice of anion for P3MEEMT does not appear to inﬂuence
charge injection rates nearly as signiﬁcantly.

Hydration and Doping. To explain the diﬀerences in ion

uptake kinetics between P3MEEMT and P3HT, we next
investigate how hydration and electrochemical doping
inﬂuence the crystal structures of P3MEEMT and P3HT.
The GIXRD pattern of P3MEEMT is very similar to that of
P3HT (Figure S10), yet P3MEEMT has a larger lamellar
spacing (1.9 versus 1.6 nm) because of its slightly longer side
chains. We observe a high degree of preferential orientation of
P3MEEMT, with the lamellar spacing occurring in the out-of-
plane direction and π−π stacking occurring in the in-plane
direction, which is similar to the situation for P3HT (Figure
S11). Figure 3A shows how the lamellar spacing of P3MEEMT
changes upon hydration and doping using GIXRD. The π−π
stacking distance does not change signiﬁcantly upon hydration
(Figure S12). This distance, however, decreases from 3.76 to
3.63 Å upon doping (Figure S13), which is similar to changes
observed in P3HT.51,52 We note that the lattice expansion
upon hydration is fully reversible, unlike in other systems where
doping leads to irreversible structural changes (Figure S14).52
By measuring GIXRD patterns dry and in water, we quantify
how much the lattice spacing of P3MEEMT changes upon
hydration. We ﬁnd a shift of the (100) peak of P3MEEMT to
lower 2θ representing ∼5% lattice expansion in water. We ﬁnd
a similar smaller shift (∼2% lattice expansion) in dry
P3MEEMT upon electrochemical doping with PF6
−(0.7 V).
These shifts demonstrate that the lattice of P3MEEMT
expands readily in solution to accommodate water and ions
in the absence of an electrochemical bias. This 5% expansion in
water is much larger than that required to accommodate the
dopants without water present, demonstrating that the
crystalline regions of P3MEEMT are hydrated in solution.
We perform the same measurements on P3HT and ﬁnd no
change in the lamellar spacing in water, yet a signiﬁcant shift of
7% in the (100) peak occurs upon electrochemical doping with
PF6
−(0.7 V) (Figure 3B). The GIXRD data for P3HT suggests
that the crystal lattice does not expand spontaneously in water
and expands only upon electrochemical doping.
The structural changes in P3MEEMT and P3HT explain the
diﬀerences in doping kinetics. Figure 3C shows a schematic of
doping in the crystalline regions of P3HT and P3MEEMT. In
the case of P3HT, the crystal lattice spacing does not expand
appreciably in solution but expands by 7% along the (100) axis
upon electrochemical doping. In contrast, P3MEEMT exhibits
an expansion of the crystal lattice by 5% when placed in
solution yet does not expand further to accommodate the
anions when a voltage is applied. Because of the diﬀerence in
structural changes between P3HT and P3MEEMT, we can
now explain the diﬀerence in kinetics between the two
polymers. We propose that P3HT exhibits slower charge
injection kinetics because the anion must be injected into the
polymer from solution and displace the hydrophobic side
chains when a potential is applied. On the other hand, in
P3MEEMT, the crystalline regions are hydrated and already
contain solvated ions. Therefore, when the potential is turned
on, ions are already close to the polymer backbone and the
lattice is already expanded, making the doping kinetics much
faster. Additional anions can then easily enter the P3MEEMT
ﬁlm through expanded, hydrated ethylene glycol channels.
Controlling Crystallinity with Thermal Annealing.
Having shown high volumetric capacitance in the ethylene
glycol side-chain polymer, we next thermally anneal
P3MEEMT in an attempt to increase its mobility and therefore
its μC* value. Figure 4A shows the GIXRD spectra for
P3MEEMT unannealed and annealed at three temperatures
(125, 145, and 165 °C) for 20 min. As the annealing
temperature increases, the degree of crystallinity increases, as
demonstrated by the increase in intensity of the lamellar
spacing (100) peak and in-plane π−π stacking (010) peak
(Figure S15). A Scherrer analysis of the GIXRD line widths
predicts that the mean size of the crystalline domains is 39 nm
(±2 nm) in the (100) direction and 6.2 nm (±0.4 nm) in the
(010) direction (Figure S16). We measure the μC* for
unannealed P3MEEMT and P3MEEMT annealed at three
temperatures and ﬁnd that it decreases with annealing
temperature (Figure 4B) from 52.9 ± 3.4 (F cm−1 V−1 s−1)
to 20.9 ± 1.1 (F cm−1 V−1 s−1) in 100 mM KCl (μC*
determination for each annealing temperature shown in Figure
S17). To investigate whether μ or C* changes most
signiﬁcantly with crystallinity, we measure the C* for each
sample with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
with ﬁts shown in Figure S18. We observe little dependence of
C* on crystallinity (Figure 4C), which implies that the number
of sites available to both electronic charges and dopant ions is
the same in amorphous and crystalline regions of the ﬁlm.
Constant C* with annealing is consistent with our GIXRD
results, showing hydrated crystalline regions in P3MEEMT,
and has been observed in other polymers as well.53 Because C*
does not change signiﬁcantly with annealing, we conclude that
the OECT mobility must decrease with increased crystallinity.
We directly measure the carrier mobility using the impedance
matching method54 and ﬁnd the mobility in the linear regime
for the unannealed polymer to be 0.19 ± 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 and
a mobility in the annealed polymer of 0.13 ± 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1.
In Figure 4D, we estimate the carrier mobility at each annealing
temperature by dividing the μC* product by the C* obtained
with EIS. In good agreement with the direct mobility
measurement, we estimate the expected mobility of unan-
nealed, amorphous P3MEEMT to be 0.19 ± 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1
and that of annealed, most-crystalline P3MEEMT to be 0.09 ±
0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. To verify that this decrease in mobility did
not originate from the PET substrate being degraded during

annealing, we measured annealed and unannealed OECTs on
glass substrates and observed the same trend (Figure S19). To
investigate the origin of the decrease in mobility, we performed
conductive atomic force microscopy (cAFM) measurements.
As expected and in contradiction to our OECT mobility results,
dry, crystalline P3MEEMT is ∼10 times more conductive in
the vertical direction than unannealed P3MEEMT in its
undoped, dry state (Figure S20). To further conﬁrm the
enhanced conductivity of dry crystalline P3MEEMT, we
fabricated and tested organic ﬁeld eﬀect transistors (OFETs)
and found a higher mobility in the annealed sample (Figure
S21). Although initially counterintuitive, this diﬀerence in
OFET mobility and OECT mobility is similar to ﬁndings by
Giovannitti et al. in which the polymer with greater dry ﬁeld
eﬀect mobility and nearly equivalent volumetric capacitance
performed signiﬁcantly worse as an OECT.36 Both of these
experiments suggest that changes in the polymer in its hydrated
or doped state can have a detrimental eﬀect on electronic
transport. Here, we speculate that the more crystalline polymer,
while having a higher dry mobility, is more susceptible to the
disruption of intergrain conductivity due to water uptake.

diﬀerence in how the mobility scales with crystallinity in
OECTs versus OFETs could stem from the fact that OECTs
operate in solution while OFETs operate in a dry state. To
investigate the role of polymer and dopant hydration in
crystalline versus noncrystalline ﬁlms of P3MEEMT, we
perform electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measure-
ments (EQCM). We measure both the unannealed P3MEEMT
ﬁlm and the most crystalline P3MEEMT ﬁlm, annealed at 165
°C. First, we compare the initial hydration state without bias of
the polymer ﬁlms and ﬁnd by both QCM with dissipation
monitoring (QCM-D) (Figure S22) and AFM proﬁlometery
that the annealed ﬁlm swells less in solution than does the
unannealed ﬁlm (Figure S23). Next, we apply a typical cyclic
voltammetry (CV) bias sweep from 0.0 to 0.7 to −0.5 V versus
Ag/AgCl (shown in Figure 5A). During the voltage sweeps, we
record both the current (Figure 5B) and frequency of the
quartz oscillator, which we convert to a change in mass using
the Sauerbrey equation (Figure 5C).55
We ﬁnd that the shapes of the current curves upon doping
and dedoping are similar for all four cases. The total current is
higher with PF6
−than with Cl−as the anion, which is
consistent with a higher threshold voltage for doping with Cl−.
We also see similar levels of charge injection for annealed and
unannealed P3MEEMT with both anions, which is consistent
with our earlier observation that C* does not depend on
crystallinity for P3MEEMT.
Although the plots of current versus time do not change
signiﬁcantly with increased crystallinity, the plots of mass
change versus time change dramatically. In unannealed
P3MEEMT with PF6
−as the dopant, we observe a signiﬁcant
initial decrease in the mass as the voltage increases and the ﬁlm
begins to be doped, followed by a small increase in mass upon
further doping. As the voltage decreases, we observe a decrease
in mass as the ﬁlm is dedoped and then a larger increase back to
the initial mass, which we attribute to the rehydration of the
ﬁlm. We observe a similar shape in the change in mass versus
time plot of unannealed P3MEEMT with Cl−as the anion. For
the unannealed ﬁlms, we observe a small decrease in mass
followed by a large increase upon doping and a large decrease
and then a small increase in mass upon dedoping. We note that
the observed decrease in mass upon doping in both cases could
be cations and water leaving the ﬁlm.56,57
The observed trends are explained in a schematic in Figure
5D. In the annealed case, the P3MEEMT thin ﬁlm swells
moderately in solution and has some waters incorporated prior
to biasing (Figure S24). Therefore, the large increase in mass
upon doping is associated with anion injection (Cl−or PF6
−)
into the ﬁlm. We note that in the mass increase region the
apparent molar mass of the Cl−dopant is 223 ± 13 g/mol,
implying that Cl−enters the polymer with a solvation shell of
approximately 10 waters, while the molar mass of the PF6
−
dopant is less than the mass of a bare PF6
−, implying that more
water is expelled from the ﬁlm upon doping. (Figure S22). In
the unannealed case, the ﬁlm swells much more in solution and
has many waters incorporated initially. Upon applying a bias,
more water leaves the ﬁlm as the polymer is oxidized and
doped by the anion. This picture is consistent with PF6
−being
a relatively hydrophobic and chaotropic ion: more waters leave
the ﬁlm upon PF6
−injection than upon Cl−injection. Cl−is
more kosmotropic and binds more strongly to the surrounding
waters. This anion dependence is consistent with previous
QCM studies on polyelectrolytes with many diﬀerent ionic
species.58

We have shown by QCM that there are major diﬀerences in
how water interacts with the annealed and unannealed ﬁlms,
namely, (1) there is much greater water uptake in the
unannealed ﬁlm prior to doping and (2) there is signiﬁcantly
more water expulsion upon doping in the unannealed ﬁlm.
Despite having more water present, the more amorphous ﬁlm
demonstrates a higher OECT mobility. On the basis of our
GIXRD data, we know that crystalline regions of the polymer
swell in water, yet the π−π stacking distance does not change
upon hydration. Therefore, changes in the amorphous regions
that connect the crystalline regions or the changes in packing
along the lamellar direction must be responsible for the
decrease in mobility upon hydration of the ﬁlm. To investigate
this hypothesis, we next examine the nanoscale dopant
distribution in crystalline and amorphous P3MEEMT with
PiFM.59
PiFM of Crystalline and Amorphous P3MEEMT. To
investigate the spatial distribution of dopants in amorphous
and crystalline P3MEEMT, we perform PiFM on P3MEEMT
ﬁlms doped with PF6
−. By detecting the P−F stretch as a
function of spatial location in the ﬁlm, we map the location of
PF6
−dopants with nanoscale spatial resolution. Figure 6A
shows the PiFM spectra of doped and undoped regions of a
P3MEEMT ﬁlm. Upon doping the ﬁlm, the PiFM spectrum
changes and a new peak we assign to the PF6
−stretch appears
at 843 cm−1. The location of this peak, if not the line shape,60 is
consistent with previous Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy and attenuated total reﬂectance (ATR) FTIR
studies.61 In addition to the emergence of the PF6
−peak at 843
cm−1, other changes in the PiFM spectrum result from doping
the thiophene backbone.
We compare PiFM images of the P−F stretch of PF6
−in
crystalline and amorphous ﬁlms of P3MEEMT. Figure 6B,C
shows the topographical and PiFM images of an unannealed,
amorphous P3MEEMT thin ﬁlm, respectively, whereas Figure
6D,E shows the topographical and PiFM images of an
annealed, crystalline P3MEEMT thin ﬁlm, respectively. PiFM
images of undoped ﬁlms have no PiFM contrast and are shown
in Figure S25. The PiFM image of the amorphous P3MEEMT
ﬁlm shows a relatively homogeneous distribution of dopants in
the ﬁlm with no distinct features. In contrast, the PiFM image
of the annealed P3MEEMT ﬁlm is much more heterogeneous
and shows distinct features of higher PF6
−anion concentration.
A Fourier transform of this image shows characteristic feature
sizes of ∼40 nm in the annealed ﬁlm, which demonstrates a
heterogeneous distribution of the anions that we hypothesize
leads to bottlenecks in charge transport (Figure S26).
The heterogeneity in dopant concentration suggests that the
ﬁlm consists of small crystallites with a high anion
concentration linked by lower-density amorphous regions
with a lower anion concentration. When submerged in an
aqueous environment, we hypothesize that amorphous regions
that link the crystalline regions swell signiﬁcantly, disrupting
the electronic connectivity between the crystalline regions of
the ﬁlm. Such morphology could cause a disruption of
electronic transport, similar to that seen as a function of
molecular weight in P3HT where lower-molecular-weight
polymers exhibit lower mobility despite being more crystal-
line.62 This eﬀect has been explained by the lack of “tie chains”
that allow for intrachain connections between diﬀerent
crystallite domains.63,64 This lack of tie chains was even
observed as a function of annealing, where annealing at higher
temperatures resulted in decreasing carrier mobility.65 If true,
in the future it may be possible to control the morphology of
ﬁlms made from polymers such as P3MEEMT (perhaps
through molecular weight) to better preserve the mobility upon
annealing.
We summarize our comparison of annealed and unannealed
P3MEEMT in Figure 7. In the dry state, GIXRD shows that the
annealed P3MEEMT ﬁlms are more crystalline than the
unannealed ﬁlms, and OFET measurements demonstrate that
the annealed ﬁlm has a higher mobility. When the ﬁlm is
hydrated, the unannealed ﬁlm expands more, as shown with
AFM proﬁlometery of the hydrated samples, and QCM data
shows that the unannealed ﬁlm takes up more waters. GIXRD
of the annealed ﬁlm shows that crystalline regions of the ﬁlm
also expand when hydrated. Upon electrochemical doping, EIS
data shows that a similar number of charges dope the annealed
and unannealed ﬁlms. Furthermore, E-QCM shows that the
unannealed ﬁlm loses more waters upon electrochemical
doping than does the annealed sample, and mobility and
OECT measurements show a higher mobility in the
unannealed ﬁlm than in the annealed ﬁlm. We hypothesize
that the change in mobility stems from the eﬀect of water
intercalation on the electronic connectivity of the polymer ﬁlm.
In the case of the annealed ﬁlm, we attribute the change in
mobility to the swelling of amorphous regions that connect the

crystalline regions of the ﬁlm. When the ﬁlm is hydrated, this
heterogeneity in swelling prevents charge carriers from moving
as easily between the crystalline regions of the ﬁlm.
■CONCLUSIONS
Our comparative study of P3MEEMT and P3HT highlights the
importance of the anion in many aspects of OECT operation.
First, larger, more hydrophobic anions shift the threshold
voltage in OECT active-layer polymers with both hydrophilic
and hydrophobic side chains, which indicates that this anion-
dependent threshold voltage shift is a general principle of
OECT operation. Larger chaotropic ions with a smaller surface
charge density, such as PF6
−, can be more easily injected into
the active-layer polymer than smaller kosmotropic ions with
high surface charge densities, such as Cl−, regardless of the
side-chain functionality. Second, our E-QCM data show that
the anion has a signiﬁcant impact on polymer hydration upon
doping. Compared to doping with Cl−, electrochemically
doping the polymer with PF6
−expels more water from the
polymer active layer. Therefore, the choice of anion could have
a profound eﬀect on the packing density and molecular-level
organization upon doping.
We additionally demonstrate that P3MEEMT, a polythio-
phene derivative with ethylene glycol-based side chains, is a
promising OECT active-layer material for accumulation mode
transistors with a μC* that rivals that of state-of-the-art OECT
materials. We observe faster doping kinetics in P3MEEMT
than in P3HT, which stems from structural changes in
P3MEEMT upon hydration. The crystalline lattice of
P3MEEMT expands in solution, allowing ions to access even
densely packed crystalline regions of the ﬁlm. In comparison,
the P3HT lattice expands only upon electrochemical doping,
requiring the anions to displace alkyl side chains and thus
slowing down ion injection kinetics compared to those of
P3MEEMT.
By increasing the crystallinity of P3MEEMT, we demon-
strate that the OECT mobility decreases and the OFET
mobility increases. We explain this diﬀerence by investigating
the role of water in both amorphous and crystalline
P3MEEMT. We ﬁnd that crystalline and amorphous
P3MEEMT have very diﬀerent hydration dynamics upon
electrochemical doping. We hypothesize that the hydration of
the ﬁlm disrupts the regions that link crystalline domains,
thereby signiﬁcantly decreasing the mobility in crystalline
P3MEEMT. This hypothesis is supported by PiFM imaging,
which maps the presence of anions within the ﬁlm and reveals a
large degree of dopant heterogeneity in crystalline P3MEEMT
compared to that in amorphous P3MEEMT.
Our data demonstrates that the presence of water can be a
double-edged sword for OECT operation that must be
considered when designing new active layers for eﬃcient
OECTs. Readily hydrated crystal lattices can facilitate ion
transport, allowing for faster anion injection kinetics and better
access for anions in tightly packed crystalline regions. However,
polymer hydration can also interrupt the connectivity between
crystalline regions of the polymer, signiﬁcantly decreasing the
charge-carrier mobility. Because of the presence of water, many
of the design principles established over the last 30 years to
optimize OFETs must be adapted before applying them to
OECTs. Overall, our data paints a complex picture of how
operating in solution and relying on anion intercalation impact
the design principles for highly eﬃcient OECTs. The complex
interplay among ion transport, charge transport, side-chain
chemistry, steady-state hydration, and hydration dynamics
upon electrochemical doping has a profound impact on OECT
operation. By understanding these challenges, it may be
possible to tailor the morphology of future OECT materials
so that they beneﬁt from improved order in the same way that
OFET performance improves with increased polymer crystal-
linity. For high C* polymers, improving the electronic carrier
mobility by an order of magnitude, the same amount that FET
mobility can be improved by annealing, would provide a clear
path to achieving μC* products of 3000 F cm−1 V−1 s−1. Such a
material would prove invaluable for the growing number of
applications relying on eﬃcient mixed electronic/ionic
conduction.

Figure 7. Schematic unifying the results from GIXRD, E-QCM, AFM,
EIS, OFET, OECT, and mobility measurements on annealed and
unannealed P3MEEMT. The red arrows indicate charge carrier
migration through the ﬁlm. In the dry state, the annealed ﬁlm is more
crystalline and has a higher mobility compared to the unannealed
sample. When hydrated, the unannealed ﬁlm swells more and takes up
more electrolyte solution. The annealed sample swells in both
crystalline and amorphous regions. Upon electrochemical doping, a
similar number of charges per volume dope both samples. The
unannealed sample loses more waters/cations and has a higher
mobility than the annealed sample. We attribute this lower mobility in
the annealed P3MEEMT to a heterogeneity in ﬁlm swelling.
Amorphous regions between the crystalline regions swell more,
disconnecting crystalline regions of the ﬁlm.
