Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are a rapidly advan-
cing technology that plays a crucial role in the development of
next-generation bioelectronic devices. Recent advances in p-type/
n-type organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) have
enabled power-eﬃcient complementary OECT technologies for
various applications, such as chemical/biological sensing, large-
scale logic gates, and neuromorphic computing. However, ensuring
long-term operational stability remains a significant challenge that
hinders their widespread adoption. While p-type OMIECs are gen-
erally more stable than n-type OMIECs, they still face limitations,
especially during prolonged operations. Here, we demonstrate that
simple methylation of the pyrrole-benzothiazine-based (PBBT)
ladder polymer backbone results in stable and high-performance
p-type OECTs. The methylated PBBT (PBBT-Me) exhibits a 25-fold
increase in OECT mobility and an impressive 36-fold increase in lC*
(mobility  volumetric capacitance) compared to the non-methylated
PBBT-H polymer. Combining the newly developed PBBT-Me with
the ladder n-type poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), we
developed complementary inverters with a record-high DC gain of
194 V V1 and excellent stability. These state-of-the-art complemen-
tary inverters were used to demonstrate leaky integrate-and-fire type
organic electrochemical neurons (LIF-OECNs) capable of biologically
relevant firing frequencies of about 2 Hz and of operating continuously
for up to 6.5 h. This achievement represents a significant improvement
over previous results and holds great potential for developing stable
bioelectronic circuits capable of in-sensor computing.
Introduction
Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) are versa-
tile materials with widespread applications in various fields,
such as bioelectronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage.1–17
One of the most notable features of OMIECs is their ability to
efficiently transport both ionic and electronic charges, setting
them apart from other organic semiconductors. This unique
interaction allows for new approaches in signal transduction
and charge transport.18 OMIECs are commonly utilized as

the channel conductance to change by orders of magnitude and
allows for transistor switching. Due to their low operating

New concepts
Electronic devices capable of in-sensor computing have the potential to
revolutionize the field of bioelectronics. Organic mixed ionic-electronic
conductors (OMIECs) are well-suited as they eﬃciently couple ionic and
electronic transport, thereby bridging electronics and biology. Recent
advancements in the design and synthesis of p-type and n-type OMIECs
have resulted in the development of power-eﬃcient devices for various
applications, including sensors, nervetronics, neural interfaces, and
artificial synapses. Organic electrochemical neurons (OECNs) with ion-
modulated spiking are the most recent addition to the bioelectronic
toolbox, enabling the development of event-based sensors capable of
local sensing, signal processing, and stimulation/actuation. However,
current OECN technology suﬀers from poor stability due to degradation
of the p-type OECT characteristics. Therefore, developing stable p-type
OMIECs is crucial for achieving high-performance OECNs. Rigid ladder
polymers can sustain a high level of electrochemical doping without
experiencing
conformational
disorder.
This
leads
to
exceptional
operational stability, high charge carrier mobility, and large volumetric
capacitance. The use of both n-type and p-type ladder polymers, with
carefully engineered backbone to ensure eﬃcient charge transport,
enables
integrate-and-fire
OECNs
with
biologically
relevant
firing
frequencies
and
excellent
stability,
representing
a
significant
improvement over previous results and opening for stable bioelectronic
device operation.

voltage, ease of manufacturing, high transconductance, and
biocompatibility, OECTs are ideal for chemical and biological
sensing,20–22 large-area printed circuitry,23 and neuromorphic
computing.24–40
While the progress in OECT-based circuitry has primarily
revolved around the exploration of the hole-transporting
(p-type) polymer PEDOT:PSS,41–45 recent advances in the design
and synthesis of p-type and n-type (electron-transporting)
OMIECs have led to the development of power-efficient com-
plementary OECT technologies.46–48 These advancements have
not only opened new possibilities for achieving improved
performance and energy efficiency in OECT-based amplifiers49,50
and digital logics46 but also facilitated the development of the first
leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) type organic electrochemical neuron
(OECN) with ion-modulated spiking.24 The breakthrough holds
great promise for bioelectronic applications, enabling the devel-
opment of event-based sensors capable of local sensing, signal
processing, and stimulation of the nervous system. This requires
the development of OECNs capable of operating stably with spike
dynamics and voltage output on par with biology. However, the
initial implementation of LIF-OECNs suffered from a low spiking
frequency (20–200 mHz) and reduced voltage output during con-
tinuous operation for over 1 h. Although reducing the OECT
channel dimensions could increase the spiking frequency, the
instability of the output current in the p-type OECT remains a
significant hurdle, leading to output voltage drop and poor opera-
tional stability. Therefore, developing stable p-type OMIECs is
crucial for achieving high-performance OECNs and enabling their
widespread implementation in bioelectronics.
Several p-type OMIECs have been reported for complemen-
tary OECT technologies, including the conjugated polyelectrolyte
poly(3-carboxypentylthiophene) (P3CPT), as well as conjugated
polymers bearing glycolated side chains such as p(g42T-T),
p(gTDPPT), and gDPP-g2T.46,48,51–53 These p-type OMIECs exhi-
bit excellent charge carrier mobility and large volumetric capa-
citance. However, several of them suffer from degradation
during continuous operation in ambient. Strategies to improve
the stability of p-type OMIECs include designing encapsulation
layers54 or tuning the polymer’s energetics55,56 to suppress
electrochemical side reactions during OECT operation, incor-
porating high-boiling-point solvents and Lewis acids to alter the
polymer chain arrangements and prevent oxidative degrada-
tion,57 and optimizing the polymer side chain distribution to
regulate swelling and enhance stability.58,59 However, p-type
OMIECs with improved stability often experience lower mobili-
ties and volumetric capacitances, resulting in overall low com-
plementary device performance.
Ladder-type polymers possess a rigid backbone structure
consisting of double-strand chains linked by condensed
p-conjugated units. This unique structure allows them to
sustain high levels of chemical/electrochemical doping without
experiencing
conformational
disorder.26,60,61
As
a
result,
ladder-type polymers exhibit exceptional operational stability,
high charge carrier mobility, and large volumetric capaci-
tance.51 One prominent example of a ladder-type polymer is
the n-type poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL), which
demonstrates outstanding operational stability in OECTs.48
Recently, Li et al.62 reported the ladder-type polymer poly-
[pyrrolo[3,2-b:4,5-b0]bis-[1,4]benzothiazine] (PBBT), which can
function as a p-type OMIEC. While PBBT shows decent stability
when used as the channel material of OECTs, it suﬀers from low
mobility and low volumetric capacitance.63
Here, we present a practical approach to enhancing the
mobility, volumetric capacitance, and stability of PBBT through
backbone engineering. Our strategy involves methylating the
PBBT polymer backbone to obtain the polymer poly[6-methyl-
pyrrolo[3,2-b:4,5-b0]bis-[1,4]benzothiazine] (PBBT-Me, Fig. 1(a)).
Notably, this subtle backbone modification leads to significant
improvements in the material properties, including a remark-
able 25-fold increase in hole mobility and an impressive 36-fold
increase in mC* of PBBT-Me as compared to the non-methylated
polymer PBBT-H, while maintaining similar stability. Using this
newly developed polymer in combination with BBL, we success-
fully demonstrate complementary inverters with a record-high
DC gain of 194 V V1 and excellent stability. These state-of-the-art
complementary inverters are then used to develop LIF-OECNs
with firing frequencies of about 2 Hz and capable of continuous
operation for up to 6.5 h. This achievement represents a sub-
stantial improvement compared to previous results and holds
great potential for the development of stable bioelectronic
circuits capable of in-sensor computing.
Results and discussion
PBBT-H and PBBT-Me were synthesized through a polycon-
densation reaction of 2,3-dibromomaleimide (Br2MIH) or 2,3-
dibromomethylmaleimide (Br2MIMe) and 2,5-diaminobenzene-
1,4-dithiol dihydrochloride (DABDT) in a 1 : 1 polyphosphoric
acid (PPA):phenylphosphonic acid64 (PhP(O)(OH)2) mixture at
180 1C (Fig. 1(a)). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed successful methyla-
tion of the PBBT polymer backbone (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). Both
ladder-type polymers have good solubility in methanesulfonic
acid (MSA) at concentrations over 10 mg mL1 and can be
deposited in thin films by spin-coating their MSA solutions onto
substrates at room temperature. The intrinsic viscosities of PBBT-
H and PBBT-Me were measured to be 0.94 dL g1 and 0.99 dL g1
(in MSA, 25 1C), respectively, which indicates comparable mole-
cular weights. Additionally, both polymers are thermally stable
with decomposition temperatures over 540 1C, and no phase
transitions were observed before decomposition (Fig. S3, ESI†).
Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that PBBT-H and
PBBT-Me have highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
energy levels of 5.06 eV and 4.87 eV, respectively. These
measurements suggest that the electron-donating eﬀect of the
methyl group makes the HOMO level of PBBL-Me shallower by
0.2 eV. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the two polymers
in diluted MSA solutions show two absorption bands located at
300–600 nm and 800–1100 nm, respectively (Fig. 1(c)). The
introduction of the methyl group in PBBT-Me compared to
PBBT-H results in a redshift of the p–p transition in the range

800–1100 nm. This redshift indicates that the methyl group
further enhances the electron-rich nature of the pyrrole unit,
leading to a narrowing of the bandgap (Eg) in the protonated
state in solution. The absorption spectra of the two polymers in
the thin film state are also similar, with a slight redshifted
absorption onset wavelength (lonset) for PBBT-Me (Fig. 1(d)).
Note that the maximum absorption peaks in solutions are
redshifted compared to those in thin films likely due to proto-
nation of the polymer backbone in solution. With the lonset of
PBBT-H being 829 nm and lonset of PBBT-Me being 868 nm, the
optical Eg is calculated to be 1.50 eV for PBBT-H and 1.43 eV for
PBBT-Me.
Next, we investigated PBBT-H and PBBT-Me thin film micro-
structure using grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
(GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). GIWAXS analy-
sis (Fig. 2(a)–(c)) reveals that PBBT-H chains are arranged
preferentially face-on on the substrate, while PBBT-Me chains
are mostly oriented edge-on. Both PBBT-H and PBBT-Me dis-
play strong p–p stacking (010) peaks located at 1.82 Å1,
indicative of a similar p–p stacking distance dp–p = 3.45 Å
(Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S4, ESI†). However, PBBT-H exhibits a
lamellar packing distance dlamellar = 8.73 Å [(100) peak at qxy =
0.72 Å1], which is shorter than PBBT-Me’s dlamellar = 9.82 Å
[(100) peak at qz = 0.64 Å1]. The observed difference in packing
distance is consistent with the presence of the methyl group on
the PBBT-Me backbone. Furthermore, PBBT-Me shows signifi-
cantly enhanced p–p stacking crystallinity with smaller FWHM
(0.1677 for PBBT-Me vs. 0.3256 for PBBT-H), longer coherence
length (33.3 Å for PBBT-Me vs. 17.2 Å for PBBT-H), and
smaller paracrystalline disorder (0.121 for PBBT-Me vs. 0.169
for PBBT-H) as shown in Fig. S4 and S5 of the ESI.† These
results suggest that PBBT-Me may be more efficient in trans-
porting charge carriers in the in-plane direction than PBBT-H.
The AFM analysis shows that both PBBT-H and PBBT-Me thin
films have a flat polycrystalline morphology (Fig. 2(d) and (e)).
The surface roughness of PBBT-H was measured to be 7.89 nm,
whereas PBBT-Me displayed a slightly smaller roughness of
6.15 nm. A summary of the solid-state microstructure charac-
teristics can be found in Table 1.
Spectroelectrochemistry was performed to investigate the
electronic structure of electrochemically doped PBBT-H and
PBBT-Me thin films. The polymer thin films were coated on
ITO substrates and subjected to a voltage bias applied to the
Ag/AgCl electrode through a 0.1 M NaCl aqueous electrolyte
(Fig. 3(a), (b) and Fig. S6 in the ESI†). Upon applying an
oxidation voltage bias within the 0–1 V range, we observed that
both PBBT-H and PBBT-Me undergo electrochemical doping
with clear bleaching of the ground state (370–800 nm) and
strong polaron absorption (4800 nm). The PBBT-H’s polaronic
species arise at an oxidation voltage of around 0.4 V, whereas

those of PBBT-Me form at around 0.5 V (Fig. 3(c)). We attributed
this difference to the introduction of the methyl group in
PBBT-Me, which resulted in a slight increase in hydrophobicity
(Fig. S14, ESI†), ultimately leading to a minor increase in the
oxidation threshold.
Next, we conducted a comprehensive characterization of the
performance of PBBT-H and PBBT-Me in OECTs. OECTs were
prepared by following the procedure reported in the Experi-
mental Section, which involves using glass wafers with pat-
terned metal and parylene layers. The channel materials were
deposited onto the OECT substrates from their MSA solutions
via spin-coating and then patterned using a sacrificial layer of
parylene to produce the OECT channel (W/L = 400 mm/6 mm).
The thickness of the polymer thin films (50 nm) was adjusted

by controlling the concentration of the MSA solution. The
OECT was then completed using 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution
as the electrolyte and an Ag/AgCl pellet as the gate electrode
(Fig. S7, ESI†). Both PBBT-H and PBBT-Me exhibit typical p-type
accumulation-mode characteristics, as evidenced by their out-
put and transfer curves (Fig. 4(a)–(d)). The ON/OFF ratio of
OECTs using PBBT-H and PBBT-Me as the channel materials
are 4.5( 0.5)  103 and 2.5( 0.3)  106, respectively (Fig. 4(c)
and (d)). The on-state current of PBBT-Me-based OECTs at
VD = VG = 0.7 V is 511  26 mA, which is approximately 10
higher than that of PBBT-H (50  2 mA). The threshold voltage
of PBBT-Me OECTs (0.52  0.01 V) is slightly larger than that of
PBBT-H (0.36  0.01 V), and consistent with the spectroelec-
trochemistry experiments. The mC* values of PBBT-H and PBBT-
Me were calculated to be 2.5  0.1 F cm1 V1 s1 and 92.3 
5.0 F cm1 V1 s1, respectively (Fig. S8, ESI†). Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the volu-
metric capacitance C* of the two polymers, resulting in values
of 179  5 F cm3 for PBBT-H and 259  6 F cm3 for PBBT-Me
(Fig. S9–S11, ESI†). Thus, the mOECT of PBBT-H and PBBT-Me
was calculated to be (1.41  0.04)  102 cm2 V1 s1 for PBBT-H
and 0.356  0.028 cm2 V1 s1 for PBBT-Me. The higher mobility
of PBBT-Me is consistent with the increased on-state current
of PBBT-Me OECTs compared to PBBT-H OECTs and can be
explained by the increased crystallinity, longer coherence
length, and preferential edge-on orientation of PBBT-Me com-
pared to PBBT-H, as revealed by the GIWAXS data (vide supra).
This edge-on arrangement facilitates interchain hole transport,
leading to more efficient charge transport in PBBT-Me. In addition,
the max gm,norm of PBBT-Me is also increased by one order of
magnitude compared to PBBT-H, from 1.11  0.02 S cm1 to
40.6  1.5 S cm1. Both PBBT-H and PBBT-Me OECTs exhibit
remarkably high stability, with over 90% of the initial drain
current retained after more than 4 hours of continuous opera-
tion (VD = VG = 0.6 V). This stability is among the highest
reported for p-type OECTs (Fig. S12 and Table S1, ESI†).55–59 The
PBBT-H OECTs have a transient response tON = 0.74  0.02 ms,
while that of PBBT-Me OECT is slightly slower at 3.19  0.05 ms
(Fig. S13, ESI†), likely due to the increased hydrophobicity of
PBBT-Me layer (Fig. S14, ESI†). Table 2 summarizes the OECT
characteristics of the two polymers.
To investigate their usage in circuits, we developed comple-
mentary electrochemical inverters utilizing PBBT-H or PBBT-
Me as the hole-transporting materials and BBL as the electron-
transporting material due to its low Vth = 0.15 V, high on/oﬀ
ratio of 105, and high gm,norm = 11 S cm1 (Fig. S15, ESI†). The

OECT-based inverter switches on and oﬀin response to a
gradual change in gate voltage (Vin) between 0 V and Vin =
VDD, while the pull-down BBL-based transistor works in the
opposite manner. As a result, the inverter’s output voltage (Vout)
switches between approximately VDD and 0 V in response to Vin,
as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). PBBT-H-based inverters operate at
VDD as low as 0.2 V with voltage gains 48 V V1 (Fig. 5(c)), while
PBBT-Me-based inverters exhibit voltage gains 420 V V1 at

Me based OECTs is 0.15 V higher than that of PBBT-H OECTs).
At VDD = 0.7 V, PBBT-H-based inverters exhibit voltage gains of
about 60 V V1, while PBBT-Me-based inverters reach record

high voltage gains of 194 V V1, which is among the highest
reported for complementary OECT inverters (Fig. S16 and
Table S2, ESI†). Mixing PBBT-Me and BBL yields ambipolar
mixtures with balanced hole and electron transport, resulting
in complementary inverters with voltage gains larger than those
recently reported for PBBT-L:BBL blends63 (Fig. S17, ESI†). This
is consistent with the fact that PBBT-Me has significantly
higher mobility and mC* than PBBT-H. Both PBBT-H and
PBBT-Me-based inverters show exceptionally low static power
consumption, ranging from 0.5 nW (VDD = 0.2 V) to 40 nW
(VDD = 0.7 V), as well as peak power consumption during switching
below 10 mW (Fig. S18, ESI†). Additionally, these inverters demon-
strate swift transient switching with small tON and tOFF in the range
of 1.5–4 ms (Fig. 5(e), (f) and Fig. S19, ESI†) and remarkable cycling
stability (Fig. S20, ESI†). Considered altogether, these inverter
characteristics are among the best reported for sub-1 V comple-
mentary inverters.46,49,52,63,65–69
Finally, we used the complementary electrochemical inver-
ters described above to develop LIF type OECNs based on a
modified version of the Axon-Hillock circuit (Fig. 6(a)).24 The
OECNs comprising the p-type PBBT-Me and n-type BBL OECTs
can fire at a frequency nearing 2 Hz and with voltage spike
amplitude (Vfire,max) of around 0.4 V at input currents Iin 4 2 mA
(Fig. 6(b)–(d) and Fig. S21, S22 in the ESI†). OECNs made of the
ambipolar PBBT-Me:BBL mixture show comparable spiking
characteristics (Fig. S23 and S24, ESI†). This biologically plau-
sible spiking frequency could mimic most neural firing rates
and can be used to stimulate biological nerves.33 These OECNs
can also be made solid state by using printable hydrogels46
based on polycationic polyquaternium-10 (PQ-10) for PBBT-Me
OECTs
and
polyanionic
poly(sodium-4-styrene
sulfonate)
(PSSNa) for BBL OECTs (Fig. S25 and S26 in the ESI†). Remark-
ably, these OECNs retain close to 90% of the initial spiking
frequencies and voltage amplitudes for over 6.5 h of continuous
spiking, outperforming similar LIF-OECNs comprising the
p-type P(g42T-T) (Fig. S27 and S28, ESI†). This excellent opera-
tional stability is paramount for the development of stable
event-based sensors.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated that simple methylation of
PBBT-based ladder-type polymers yields a p-type OMIEC with
notable OECT performance (i.e., gm,norm = 40.6  1.5 S cm1,
mC* = 92.3  5.0 F cm1 V1 s1, and tON = 3.19  0.02 ms).
We attributed these remarkable characteristics to an enhanced
intermolecular charge transport, which results from a rearran-
gement of the polymer chains induced by the introduction of
the methyl group in the PBBT polymer backbone. In addition,
the rigid ladder-type polymer backbone endows PBBT-Me with
outstanding electrochemical stability, making it suitable for
long-term operation. Complementary inverters based on PBBT-
Me and BBL exhibit record-high voltage gains 4190 V V1, low
static power consumption o40 nW, and excellent operational
stability. This allowed us to build LIF-type OECNs with a stable
operation for 46.5 h without significant degradation in terms
of firing frequency (1–2 Hz) and voltage amplitude (0.4–0.5 V).
These results open the path for developing high-performance
complementary OECT-based amplifiers and artificial neurons
for brain-inspired electronics.

Synthesis
2,5-Diamino-1,4-benzenedithiol dihydrochloride (DABDT) was
purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. 2,3-Dibromomale-
imide (Br2MIH), polyphosphoric acid (PPA), phenylphosphonic-
acid (PhP(O)(OH)2), N-methylpyrrole, tetrahydrofuran (THF),
N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA),
n-hexane, nitric acid, ethyl acetate were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich.
N-Methyl-3,4-dibromomaleimide (Br2MIMe), the polymeri-
zation precursor of PBBT-Me, was synthesized following a
reported procedure.70 N-Methylpyrrole (6.00 g, 73.97 mmol)
was placed in a three-necked round-bottom flask, then dry
THF (200 mL) was added and the system was kept under
nitrogen atmosphere. After N-methylpyrrole was completely
dissolved, the solution was cooled to 78 1C. NBS power
(74.17 g, 416.73 mmol) was added in 10 portions during
20 minutes to keep the mixture at a low temperature. The
mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at this temperature, then
restored to room temperature and stirred for 12 hours. The
solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure,
and 20 mL of dichloromethane was added to the residual solid.
The dichloromethane solution was isolated by filtration, con-
centrated to 10 mL, transferred to a 100 mL single-necked
bottle and placed in ice bath. Concentrated nitric acid was
added dropwise to make sure the temperature of the mixture
wouldn’t increase. The reaction mixture was kept at 0 1C for
3 hours. The obtained solution was subsequently quenched
with ice and water mixture and ethyl acetate (3  50 mL) was
used to extract the soluble fraction. The organic layer was
collected, successively washed with water, sodium bicarbonate,
and brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. The
crude product was recrystallized from ethanol, and the final
product Br2MIMe was obtained as colorless needles with 84%
(16.77 g) yield. NMR: 1H (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): d [ppm] 2.95
(s, 3H).
PBBT-Me was synthesized based on a procedure reported
before.64 PPA (26 g) and PhP(O)(OH)2 (26 g) were added to a
250 mL three-necked flask fitted with an overhead stirrer and
nitrogen inlet/outlet. The mixture of PPA and PhP(O)(OH)2 was
deoxygenated by heating at 110 1C for 2 hours with nitrogen
bubbling through. The solution was cooled to room tempera-
ture and 2.00 g (8.16 mmol) of DABDT was added. The mixture
was heated at 80 1C for 12 hours to remove HCl, then Br2MIMe
(2.19 g, 8.16 mmol) was added. This solution was heated at
80 1C for another 12 hours, then heated at 150 1C for 24 hours.
Next, the temperature was gradually increased to 180 1C and
kept for 48 hours to complete the polymerization. The obtained

black solution was cooled to room temperature and poured into
1 L of ethanol with the aid of a stirrer for better mixing. The
obtained polymer precipitate was collected by filtration and
washed with ethanol. It was then re-dissolved into methane-
sulfonic acid and re-precipitated in 1 L of ethanol. Again, the
solid was collected by filtration, washed thoroughly with water
and ethanol, and dried in vacuum to yield brown solid product
PBBT-Me (1.97 g, 99.3% yield, Z = 0.989 dL g1 in MSA at 30 1C,
Mv = 8.82 kDa). In estimation of Mv, the viscosity was mea-
sured with an Ubbelohde viscometer and calculated with48,71

PBBT-H was synthesized following a reported procedure.64
The same setup was used as in PBBT-Me synthesis, and the
synthesis procedure was similar, except that the reactant DBMI-
Me was replaced with 2,3-dibromomaleimide. In brief, PPA
(21 g) and PhP(O)(OH)2 (21 g) were added to a 250 mL three-
necked flask fitted with an overhead stirrer and nitrogen inlet/
outlet. The mixture of PPA and PhP(O)(OH)2 was heated at
110 1C for 2 hours with nitrogen bubbling through. Then, the

g
(6.68 mmol) of DABDT was added. The reaction mixture was
heated at 80 1C for 12 hours to remove HCl, and then Br2MIH
(1.70 g, 6.68 mmol) was added. This mixture was kept at 80 1C
for another 12 hours. Next, the solution was heated at 150 1C
for 24 hours and then the temperature was gradually increased
to 180 1C. The reaction mixture was kept at 180 1C for 48 hours
to obtain PBBT-H polymer. The post-processing was the same
as that of PBBT-Me. The final product PBBT-H was yield as
brown solid product PBBT-H (1.27 g, 85% yield, Z = 0.938 dL g1
in MSA at 30 1C, Mv = 8.48 kDa). In estimation of Mv, the
viscosity was measured with an Ubbelohde viscometer and
calculated with71,72 K = 5.11  106 g dL1 and a = 1.34.

S, 28.0; found: C, 48.3; H, 2.3; N, 15.0; S, 25.6.
Thin-film casting
PBBT-H and PBBT-Me were dissolved in MSA at 60 1C for
2 hours and subsequently cooled to room temperature. The
solutions were then spin-cast (1000 rpm, 60 s, acceleration
1000 rpm s1) onto glass, ITO-glass or Si/SiO2 substrates to
form thin films. The substrates covered with polymer films
were immersed into deionized water to remove residual MSA
and then blown dry with nitrogen. The concentration of the
polymer solution was adjusted between 2–11 mg mL1 to
obtain thin films with thickness of 20–100 nm.
Absorption spectra
Absorption spectra were performed with 7 mg mL1 polymer-
MSA solutions and 70 nm-thick polymer thin films on glass
slides. Spectroelectrochemistry measurement was performed
with indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates spin-cast on
70 nm-thick polymer thin films. The polymer films were
grounded, and the substrates were immersed in 0.1 M NaCl
solution, serving as the electrolyte. An Ag/AgCl pellet was used
as the gate electrode applied with specific voltages through
Keithley 4200A-SCS. Each voltage step was kept for 200 s before
absorption spectra measuring, which was carried out with
PerkinElmer Lambda 900 spectrometer at 25 1C.
Electrochemistry
Electrochemical measurements were carried out with Potentio-
stat Biologic SP-200. In CV measurement, deoxygenized 0.1 M
n-Bu4NPF6 anhydrous acetonitrile solution served as the elec-
trolyte, saturated Ag/AgCl electrode worked as the reference
electrode (RE), and a 10 mm  10 mm platinum mesh was used
as the counter electrode (CE). PBBT-H and PBBT-Me thin-films
were spin-cast from 5 mg mL1 MSA solutions onto chromium
(5 nm)/gold (50 nm) deposited glass slides (5 mm  5 mm)
to make working electrode (WE). The scan rate used for CV
measurement was 50 mV s1. In electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, the electrolyte was 0.1 M NaCl
aqueous solution, the RE was a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode,
and the CE was a 10 mm  10 mm platinum mesh. Cr/Au
electrodes (on glass slides) were deposited with diﬀerent
amount of polymers through spin-coating to form films with
various volumes. The obtained PBBT-H or PBBT-Me film with a
volume of 7.5  107–5.1  106 cm3 serves as the WE. In each
measurement of capacitance, WE was applied with bias of 0.6 V
or 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl, and the frequency range was 0.1 Hz–10 kHz.
A Randles circuit model Rs + Rp/CPE was used to fit the curves and
to extract the capacitance. In this circuit, Rs is the resistance of
active electrolyte, Rp represents the resistance in charge transfer,
and CPE is a constant phase element.
Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering
GIWAXS experiments were performed following the reported
procedure.48 All samples for GIWAXS measurements were
deposited on cut silicon wafers and had a thickness of about
100 nm. They were measured at BeamLine 9A in the Pohang
Accelerator Laboratory in South Korea. The X-ray energy was
11.08 eV and the incidence angle was 0.121. Samples were
measured in vacuum and the total exposure time was 10 s.
The scattered X-rays were recorded by a charge-coupled device
detector located 221.9351 mm from the sample.
OECTs, complementary inverters, and LIF neurons
OECTs were fabricated following a procedure reported pre-
viously.26 Microscope glass slides were thoroughly cleaned via
successive sonication in acetone, deionized water, and isopro-
panol, and then blown dry with nitrogen. Source/drain electro-
des were thermally deposited with 5 nm Cr and 50 nm Au, and
patterned with photolithography and wet etching. A first layer
of parylene C (1 mm) was coated together with a drop of
3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (A-174 Silane), to serve
as an insulating layer between the metal electrode and the
electrolyte. A dilution of industrial surfactant (2% Micro-90)
was subsequently spin-coated before the depositing of a second
layer (sacrificial layer) of parylene C (1 mm). To protect parylene

C layers from a subsequent plasma reactive ion etching step
(150 W, O2 = 500 sccm, CF4 = 1000 sccm, 380 s), a thick positive
photoresist (5 mm, AZ 10XT 520CP) was spin-coated on top of
the parylene C layers. A second photolithographic patterning
step followed by an application of AZ developer was carried out
to define the contact pads and the OECT channels. The sub-
sequent plasma reactive ion etching step was applied to indis-
criminately remove the organic layers including photoresist
and parylene C, until the contact pads and the OECT channel
area were exposed to the air, while the other part of the device
was still covered with two layers of parylene C. The channel
between source and drain was patterned to be W/L = 400 mm/6
mm. The obtained OECT device was spin-coated with PBBT-H,
PBBT-Me or BBL MSA solutions to form polymer film of 50 nm.
After removing the residual MSA by immersing the device in
deionized water, the polymer film was dried with nitrogen flow.
The sacrificial layer of parylene C was peeled oﬀ, removing the
polymer film on top of it and leaving the polymer in the
patterned area, which was the OECT channel and the electrode
pads. Thus, the source and the drain electrode were connected
by a micrometer-scale piece of p-type or n-type polymer. For
all OECTs, 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution was used as the
electrolyte, and an Ag/AgCl pellet (purchased from VWR) was
used as the gate electrode. The complementary inverters were
assembled by connecting a p-type (PBBT-H or PBBT-Me) OECT
and an n-type (BBL) OECT with silver paste. The LIF neurons
were assembled by connecting two p-type (PBBT-Me) OECT and
three n-type (BBL) OECTs as shown in Fig. 6(a). For processing
convenience of the LIF neuron, the channel width to length
ratio is W/L = 325/40 mm/mm for p-type OECTs and W/L =
1300/40 mm/mm for n-type OECTs. The LIF neurons based on
P(g42T-T) and BBL were assembled in a similar way, and W/L
was the same. The devices were characterized with Keilthley
4200A-SCS (with 4225-PMU Ultra Fast I-V Module and 4225-
RPM Remote Amplifier/Switch Modules).
