In organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs), it is critical to 
understand the motion of ions in the electrolyte and OMIEC. Generally, the 
focus is on the movement of net charge during gating, and the motion of 
neutral anion–cation pairs is seldom considered. Uptake of mobile ion pairs 
by the semiconductor before electrochemical gating (passive uptake) can be 
advantageous as this can improve device speed, and both ions can participate 
in charge compensation during gating. Here, such passive ion pair uptake in 
high-speed solid-state devices is demonstrated using an ion gel electrolyte. 
This is compared to a polymerized ionic liquid (PIL) electrolyte to understand 
how ion pair uptake affects device characteristics. Using X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy, the passive uptake of ion pairs from the ion gel into the OMIEC 
is detected, whereas no uptake is observed with a PIL electrolyte. This is cor-
roborated by X-ray scattering, which reveals morphological changes to the 
OMIEC from the uptake of ion pairs. With in situ Raman, a reorganization of 
both anions and cations is then observed during gating. Finally,  the speed and 
retention of OMIEC-based neuromorphic devices are tuned by controlling the 
freedom of charge motion in the electrolyte.

ions from an electrolyte into the OMIEC 
film. In organic electrochemical transistors 
(OECTs), ions from the electrolyte com-
pensate electronic charges on the polymer 
backbone to transduce biological signals, in 
energy storage devices injected ions drive 
the motion of electrons through an external 
circuit, and in organic electrochemical 
random-access memories (ECRAMs) the 
change in conductance induced by ion 
injection is used to write/erase memory 
states. Often, the speed of OMIEC-based 
electrochemical devices is an important 
figure of merit: OECTs must transduce 
biological signals at physiologically relevant 
time scales,[13,14] high charging rates are 
desired for energy storage devices,[8] and 
ECRAMs must attain sub-µs operation to 
be viable for neuromorphic computing.[11] 
Thus, understanding the doping processes 
that govern device operation and speed is 
essential for the design of next generation 
OMIECs, electrolytes, and devices.
Solid-state electrochemical devices are generally regarded 
as inherently slow since their switching time is limited by 
ionic transport through a solid-state electrolyte and semicon-
ductor film.[15,16] To improve response times, the polarity of 
polyelectrolyte dielectrics has been used to control the mode 
of operation of organic transistors, namely by limiting elec-
trochemical charging in favor of electric double-layer (EDL)

charging.[17,18] Pairing polyelectrolytes and semiconductors 
of opposite polarity (e.g., a p-type channel with a polyanion 
dielectric) limits charging to the EDL formed at the channel–
dielectric interface, enhancing device speed since mobile ions 
need not permeate the bulk of the organic semiconductor, 
albeit at the expense of current density.[19] However, recent 
reports showing 20  ns switching in ion-gel-based neuromor-
phic devices,[6] as well as the high speed of internal ion-gated 
transistors[12,18] stand out as notable exceptions and suggest 
an incomplete understanding of the factors governing solid-
state OMIEC device speed. Current consensus suggests that 
in p-type OMIECS positively charged holes on the conjugated 
chains are compensated by injection of negatively charged 
anions. Consequently, studies varying the anion of aqueous 
electrolytes have highlighted the complex role of anions 
in both glycolated OECT materials[21] and poly(3-hexylthio-
phene).[22] However, Flagg et al. recently challenged this notion 
by showing that charge compensation can also occur via cation 
expulsion in certain aqueous electrolytes,[23] confirming ear-
lier speculation that OMIEC swelling may introduce ion pairs 
in the material.[9] In solid-state OMIEC devices, similar ion 
uptake, namely that of bulky ionic liquid molecules prior to 
gating, was also recently reported,[6] but the role of such ion 
uptake on the device operation was not investigated in detail. 
Indeed, a study elucidating the role of passive ion uptake in 
OMIECs, particularly solid-state devices, and its effect on 
device speed, performance, polymer structure, and doping has 
not been reported.
Here, we explore how passive ion uptake affects the struc-
ture, dynamics, and operation of the OMIEC poly(2-(3,3′-bis(2-
(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)
thieno [3,2-b]thiophene), [p(g2T-TT)].[24] To gain insight into 
passive uptake of anion–cation pairs, we compare devices 
based on gels permeated with ionic liquids, where both the 
cation and anion are mobile, to devices made with the cor-
responding polymerized ionic liquid (PIL), where the cation 
is purposefully tethered to a polymeric backbone and thus 
rendered immobile. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS), we confirm passive ionic liquid uptake in the OMIEC 
film, whereas no ion pair uptake is observed in the case of 
PIL. We also observe that the passive uptake of ions by the 
OMIEC leads to irreversible structural changes, most notably 
in the lamellar ordering of the semiconductor. Another con-
sequence of the observed ion pair uptake is the possibility of 
both anionic and cationic hole compensation in the p-type 
OMIEC, where holes can be electrostatically compensated by 
injection of anions as well as by expulsion of cations from 
the film. We provide evidence for this mechanism via in situ 
Raman spectroscopy where we observe reorganization of 
both anions and cations in a swollen film under bias. Last, 
we demonstrate how these processes affect the performance 
of solid-state neuromorphic devices, demonstrating a tradeoff 
between speed and synaptic state retention. This work demon-
strates the importance of considering cationic hole compen-
sation in ion gel-based organic electrochemical devices. This 
helps strengthen the mechanistic understanding of speed and 
doping in OMIECs and suggests that cation engineering could 
be an effective tuning strategy to realizing high-performance 
devices.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Ion Uptake in Organic Mixed Ionic–Electronic Conductors
To directly investigate the role of ion uptake, we compare 
devices which exhibit ion uptake by the OMIEC to those which 
do not. We control ion uptake through the use of a PIL, where 
the imidazolium-based cation of the ionic liquid is chemically 
tethered to a polymer backbone, rendering the cation immo-
bile while the counterion (TFSI− in this case) is mobile.[19,25] 
The resulting electrolyte inhibits ion pair uptake in the OMIEC 
film since the polyelectrolyte cannot enter the semicon-
ducting polymer film. In contrast, the ion gel, which consists 
of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)
imide (EMIM:TFSI) mixed with PVDF-HFP, contains both 
mobile anions and cations (Figure 1a), and these electrostati-
cally neutral ion pairs can permeate the OMIEC channel. For 
direct comparison, the mobile anion of the ion gel and that of 
the PIL are chemically identical (TFSI), as shown in Figure 1a. 
Such passive ion uptake in the case of the ion gel and lack of 
uptake in the case of the PIL is schematically illustrated in 
Figure 1b.
We confirm ion pair uptake by spin coating p(g2T-TT) films 
on top of either 1) the ion gel film or 2) the PIL film and using 
XPS to detect ions in the resulting p(g2T-TT) film (Figure 1b). 
The high surface sensitivity of XPS allows for selective charac-
terization of the OMIEC film, without collecting signal from 
the underlying electrolyte film, illustrated in Figure  1b. The 
ions used in this work contain unique atomic species, allowing 
for independent detection of anions and cations within 
p(g2T-TT).
For OMIEC films on the PIL, we do not detect significant 
signal attributed to the electrolyte ions because the polymerized 
electrolyte inhibits ion pair uptake into the organic semicon-
ductor since cations are tethered to the polymer electrolyte. The 
weak F1s and S2p signal is believed to be a result of TFSI anion 
diffusion into the film as a result of ambient oxidation of p(g2T-
TT).[26] However, this cannot be confirmed due to the absence 
of C1s and N1s peaks from to the mobile TFSI anion, likely due 
to lower relative sensitivity.
Unlike the spectrum of p(g2T-TT) on the PIL, which 
resembles that of pristine p(g2T-TT), the spectrum of p(g2T-
TT) on the ion gel shows unique binding energies (BE) 
matching those of the EMIM cation, the TFSI anion, and 
p(g2T-TT) (Figure S1, Supporting Information).[27] Evidence 
of the TFSI anion (shaded in blue) can be seen in the high BE 
C1s peak (BE = 293 eV) and F1s peak and from CF3 groups 
(Figure  1c,d), the higher energy S2p doublet (BE  =  169, 
170.1 eV) from the sulfonamide groups (Figure 1e), and the 
lower energy N1s peak (BE = 399.5 eV) from the negatively 
charged nitrogen of the TFSI anion (Figure  1f). The N1s 
spectra also shows a second peak (BE = 402.2 eV, shaded in 
red) with twice the intensity from the two positively charged 
nitrogen atoms of the EMIM cation (Figure 1f). The presence 
of both anions and cations in the p(g2T-TT) film suggests 
that the electronically neutral ion pairs in the ionic liquid 
solvate the polar side chains of the OMIEC,[28–30] which intro-
duces anions and cations in the semiconducting polymer 
film.

2.2. Electrolyte-Induced Structural Changes
After confirming ion uptake in p(g2T-TT) with the ion gel elec-
trolyte and the ability to control this phenomenon by using a 
PIL, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) 
was used to probe any structural changes induced by ion uptake. 
To investigate the structure of p(g2T-TT) in the presence of PIL 
and ion-gel electrolytes, electrolyte films (≈70  nm) were spun 
on top of a p(g2T-TT) film, and the two-layer OMIEC/electrolyte 
films were measured. Note that the layers in this geometry are 
flipped compared to those used for XPS. While the scattering 
from the underlying p(g2T-TT) film was attenuated by the over-
layer of electrolyte, the scattering intensity was sufficient to 
monitor changes in the OMIEC morphology.
The pristine p(g2T-TT) film (Figure  2a) shows well-defined 
scattering peaks characteristic of a semi-crystalline microstruc-
ture. Scattering peaks present in the out-of-plane (Qz) direction 
at 0.388 and 0.782 Å−1 are assigned to the lamellar (h00) planes, 
and the scattering peak in the in-plane (Qxy) direction at 
1.761 Å−1 is assigned to the (010) plane associated with features 
in the π-stacking direction of the polymer. Pristine p(g2T-TT) is 
predominantly edge-on in texture, evidenced by the presence of 
strong lamellar (h00) intensity in the Qz direction and strong 
π-stacking (010) intensity in the Qxy direction.[21,24] Films of 
p(g2T-TT) with PIL and ion gel electrolytes present both show 
scattering rings in the 2D spectra (Figure 2a), indicating highly 
isotropic ordering in these electrolytes. The relatively strong 
scattering of the ion-gel arises from the ordering of anions 
and cations in the ionic liquid and suggests that ordering of 
the ionic liquid is unaffected by its confinement within the 
OMIEC, or the PVDF-HFP matrix (Figure S2, Supporting 
Information).[31]
Despite the electrolyte overlayer, the scattering signal from 
p(g2T-TT) still provides details regarding the polymer structure. 
p(g2T-TT) with the PIL electrolyte appears similar to the pris-
tine polymer, and fitting of the spectra (Figure S2 and Table S1, 
Supporting Information) reveals only a slight expansion of 
1.2 Å (7.5%) in the lamellar stacking direction (Figure 2b). Elec-
trolyte gating of p(g2T-TT) by Cendra et  al. resulted in sig-
nificantly larger lamellar expansions (2–3× greater), thus it is 
expected that the minor expansion presently observed is due to 
the solvent from the PIL solution spun on the p(g2T-TT) film. 
These results indicate that the presence of the PIL causes little 
disruption to the ordering of p(g2T-TT).
Conversely, we see notable changes in the scattering of 
p(g2T-TT) with the ion gel electrolyte, specifically in the 
scattering peak associated with the lamellar ordering of 
the polymer. There is no prominent (100) lamellar stacking 
peak present, but the shoulder at 0.44 Å−1 is attributed to be 
the (200) lamellar peak, suggesting that the (100) peak has

p(g2T-TT) (purple) and p(g2T-TT) films spun on ion gel (black) and PIL (red) electrolytes. The spectra show significant signal corresponding to the 
ionic liquid ions that have entered the p(g2T-TT) film, whereas the PIL spectra resembles that of the pristine polymer. Peak fits corresponding to the 
EMIM cation (red) and TFSI anion (blue) of the are shown for the p(g2T-TT) on ion gel spectra.

expanded outside the accessible q-range of the measurement 
(Figure 2b). This translates to a lamellar spacing distance of 
28.2 Å, an expansion of 12 Å (a 75% increase) compared to 
the pristine polymer (Table S1, Supporting Information). A 
recent operando study of p(g2T-TT) in an aqueous environ-
ment reported a similar lamellar expansion (10  Å), high-
lighting the drastic structural changes which can occur in 
ion-swollen OMIECs.[32] We further note that the lengths 
of the EMIM cation and TFSI anion along their longest 
dimension have been calculated to be 7.9 and 7.6  Å, respec-
tively.[33,34] Thus, the expansion of the lamellar spacing of 
the polymer is commensurate with sizes of the ionic liquid 
molecules that were detected within the OMIEC film using 
XPS (Figure 1b–f).
Unlike the lamellar stacking direction, the π-stacking peak 
remains within experimental error (≈0.01 Å−1)[35] of the pris-
tine polymer for both PIL and ion gel samples (Figure  2c). 
The combination of lamellar distortion, and simultaneous 
preservation of the π-stacking distance leads us to con-
clude that ionic liquid uptake in the crystalline portion of 
the polymer film is primarily localized to the side-chain 
rich lamellar regions. Despite the structural disorder intro-
duced into the crystallites by the ionic liquid, OECTs fabri-
cated with the ion gel electrolyte still show hole mobilities of 
0.72 ± 0.16 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Figure S3, Supporting Information), 
similar to values reported for various aqueous electrolytes.[22] 
This indicates that the structural changes from the bulky 
ionic liquid molecules do not adversely alter charge transport 
in the conjugated polymer.
2.3. Investigation of Ion Motion during Operation
Electrochemical doping in OMIECs occurs by net movement of 
ionic charges to compensate changes in electronic charge car-
rier density in the film; in general, this means the introduction 
of counterions into the organic semiconductor film. However, 
as consequence of the passive ion uptake observed in p(g2T-
TT), holes can be electrostatically compensated by either the 
injection of an anion into the film from the electrolyte, or the 
expulsion of a cation from the film into the electrolyte, as both 
ions are mobile. Doping via cation expulsion has been reported 
previously in redox-active organic radical polymers,[36] self-
doped organic semiconductors,[37] and recently with an OMIEC 
in an aqueous electrolyte.[23] To investigate this possibility in ion 
gel-gated devices, in situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy 
(SERS) was used to monitor spectral changes in p(g2T-TT) 
electrodes during charging. A confocal Raman microscope 
was used in conjunction with the surface sensitivity of SERS 
to selectively probe the p(g2T-TT) film above a gold electrode 
without collecting significant signal from the electrolyte over-
layer (Figure 3a).
To establish controls prior to in situ gating, spectra were col-
lected on films of pristine p(g2T-TT), films of p(g2T-TT) with 
PIL electrolyte, and films of p(g2T-TT) with ion gel electrolyte 
(Figure  3b). The spectra of pristine p(g2T-TT) and p(g2T-TT) 
with the PIL electrolyte are remarkably similar, whereas the 
p(g2T-TT) film with the ion gel electrolyte shows notable dif-
ferences. The PIL does not intermix with the p(g2T-TT), and 
consequently, when the OMIEC film is probed via Raman, the

spectral signal is dominated by scattering from (pg2T-TT) and 
no detectable signal from the PIL itself. This result confirms 
the sensitivity of this technique to selectively probe OMIEC film 
and agrees with XPS and GIWAXS results that the PIL elec-
trolyte prevents ion uptake by the polymer, or in other words 
passive ion uptake only occurs for charge neutral ion pairs. Con-
versely, the ion uptake observed via XPS and GIWAXS suggests 
that ionic liquid ions should be detected within the p(g2T-TT) 
film with ion gel electrolyte. Indeed, the spectra shows char-
acteristic peaks of both the EMIM cation (961 and 1024 cm−1) 
and TFSI anion (741, 1138, and 1243 cm−1) as well as peaks from 
p(g2T-TT) (Figure  3b). The Raman signal of p(g2T-TT) below 
1350 cm−1 is primarily due to side chain contributions, whereas 
the CC/CC stretching of the backbone between 1400 and 
1500 cm−1 dominates the higher frequency region.
The decrease in the backbone peak intensities with the ion 
gel electrolyte indicates slight oxidation of the film in its native 
state.[38,39] We suspect that this oxidation occurs due to trace 
water and oxygen impurities in the electrolyte.[26,40] This effect 
appears more pronounced in the ion gel than in the PIL, as the 
PIL likely limits any oxidation to the surface of the polymer 
whereas the ionic liquid penetrates the bulk of the film.
To investigate the possibility of anionic and cationic hole 
compensation in p(g2T-TT) upon electrochemical gating, we 
performed in situ SERS measurement on p(g2T-TT) electrodes 
gated with the ion gel electrolyte (Figure 3c). As in other in situ

preted ion motion observed during gating. b) Spectra of p(g2T-TT) with the ion gel electrolyte show characteristic vibrations of EMIM cations and TFSI 
anions, whereas films with the PIL electrolyte are almost identical to pristine p(g2T-TT). Spectra are offset for comparison and the dotted lines highlight

Raman studies of organic semiconductors, we observe a drop 
in intensity upon oxidation of the polymer film attributed to 
a loss of oscillator strength.[39] To examine relative changes in 
different modes, all spectra were normalized to the side chain 
peak at 1175 cm−1,[47–49] as this peak has no overlap with ionic 
liquid peaks, and is expected to exhibit minimal changes upon 
oxidation/reduction of the polymer. As the potential of the 
electrode is modulated, we follow peak shifts and intensity 
changes in both the backbone regions of the organic semicon-
ductor (1400–1500 cm−1, Figure 3c, right), as well as in the ionic 
liquid peaks (Figure 3c, left). As the p(g2T-TT) film potential is 
varied from a reduced state (−1 V) to an oxidized state (1 V), the 
intensity of the backbone peaks decreases due to the formation 
of charge carriers (polarons and bipolarons) along the back-
bone.[50] These changes to the backbone peaks during oxidation 
and reduction appear to be reversible, as spectra in the oxidized 
and reduced state are nearly identical regardless of biasing his-
tory (Figure 3d and Figure S4, Supporting Information).
Examining the ionic liquid peaks provides further insight 
on ion motion within the organic semiconductor. The two 
most pronounced anion peaks, at 741 and 1243 cm−1, have been 
assigned to a symmetric TFSI breathing mode and symmetric 
stretching of the CF3 group on the TFSI anion, respectively.[43] 
As the potential of the film is increased and p(g2T-TT) is oxi-
dized, the intensity of these TFSI modes increases (Figure 3d). 
These intensity changes are consistent with changes in TFSI 
anion concentration due to ion drift in response to the applied 
electric field: there is an increase in anion concentration as 
p(g2T-TT) is oxidized (to compensate holes), and that con-
centration subsequently decreases as p(g2T-TT) is reduced 
(Figure 3a).
Insightful changes are also observed in peaks associated 
with the EMIM cation, located at 961 and 1025 cm−1. The peak 
at 961  cm−1 has contributions from in-plane ring stretching 
and bending, and a contribution from the CC stretch of the 
ethyl group, while the peak at 1025 cm−1 has been assigned to 
in-plane stretches of the imidazolium ring.[41,43,44] These peaks 
show a similar trend as the anion peaks: an increase in inten-
sity at more positive potentials, and decrease in intensity as the 
potential is decreased (Figure 3c,d). This result initially appears 
surprising, as it is unlikely that cations would move against the 
applied electric field. In fact, these results are in agreement 
with studies of imidazolium ionic liquids at various electrodes 
that showed increasing electrode potential causes a reorienta-
tion of the imidazolium ring from parallel to perpendicular to 
the electrode, as schematically illustrated in Figure 3a.[51–54]
SERS selectively enhances the intensity of vibrations perpen-
dicular to the surface, resulting in an increase in the intensity 
of the cation peaks as the imidazolium ring reorients perpen-
dicular to the surface.[55,56] As such, we are unable to confirm 
and quantify cation motion in the film during gating, as the 
intensity changes from cation reorientation masks any pos-
sible concentration changes which may occur. Thus, while we 
cannot confirm it experimentally, we hypothesize that the elec-
trode potential will trigger anionic and cationic currents as both 
species are mobile. It should be noted that the large charge 
density in the ion permeated polymer semiconductor results 
in little electric field in the bulk of the film, requiring net ion 
motion to occur at the polymer/electrolyte interface. In this 
context, cation reorientation at the electrode is noteworthy as it 
shows that cations within the film respond to the applied field 
resulting in ion movement and restructuring at the electrode.
The Raman peaks indicative of oxidation/reduction of p(g2T-
TT) are more reversible and exhibit less hysteresis compared to 
the peaks corresponding to the ionic liquid anions and cations 
(Figure 3d). We note that the hysteresis presently observed in 
ionic liquid peak intensities is similar to the complex changes 
in ion density and reorganization observed during gating of 
electrode interfaces with ionic liquids[51] and even within lay-
ered 2D materials.[57] This suggests that some of the existing 
knowledge of ionic liquid structure and dynamics at charged 
interfaces may still be valid when the ionic liquid is confined 
within a semiconducting polymer.
In summary, given the presence of both anions and cations 
within the film and the spectral changes observed during 
device operation, we speculate that both ions are likely involved 
in the charge compensation of electronic charges. We expect 
the relative contribution of anions and cations to be related to 
their relative mobilities within the organic semiconductor. As 
a result, switching speed may be improved by increasing the 
mobility of either ion, not only that of the anion as one might 
initially think.
2.4. Application to Organic Electrochemical Devices:  
Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Electrochemical 
Random-Access Memories
To investigate how the uptake of ion pairs affects the func-
tionality of p(g2T-TT) electrochemical devices, we study a 
neuromorphic device (ECRAM) fabricated with both electro-
lytes, which we also operate as a conventional OECT by meas-
uring its transfer characteristics via a continuous gate sweep. 
ECRAMs have a similar architecture to OECTs, using a high-
capacitance polarizable gate electrode in order to impart non-
volatility to the device.[12] When operated as artificial synapses, 
ECRAMs are biased by sending identical voltage pulses to 
the gate electrode (“write” pulses) and recording the changes 
in channel conductance with a subsequent “read” pulse 
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). Similar to OECTs, facile 
ion motion within the OMIEC is an important design consid-
eration for ECRAMs, since electrolytes must have sufficiently 
mobile ions to respond to the fast (20 ns) write pulses used to 
program synaptic weights.[6] On the other hand, state retention 
is also an important device parameter in ECRAMs, which is 
related to preventing ion motion back to the electrolyte. As a 
result, ECRAMs are ideal devices to observe how controlling 
ion motion affects device characteristics and understand mate-
rials trade-offs.
When operated as conventional OECTs, devices with the 
PIL electrolyte show considerable hysteresis compared to ion 
gel devices, despite the significantly slower scan rates used to 
compensate for the lower ionic conductivity of the PIL[19,1,58] 
(Figure  4a and Figure S6 and Table S2, Supporting Informa-
tion). The presence of hysteresis indicates slow device speed 
as ion motion cannot keep up with the gate voltage sweep. 
Importantly, the modulation of the PIL-based device is com-
parable to that of the ion gel-gated device, proving that ion

penetration does occur in the PIL-based device to modulate the 
whole volume of the semiconductor, albeit at a much slower 
rate. We also observe a thickness dependence of the hysteresis, 
suggesting that ion transport through the OMIEC film (and 
not the electrolyte) limits device speed (Figure S7, Supporting 
Information). In addition to the high conductivity of ion gels, it 
is therefore expected that the uptake of ion pairs by p(g2T-TT) 
contributes to the enhanced device speed of ion gel-gated 
OECTs compared to their polymerized analog where only uni-
polar ion motion occurs and the ions don't passively permeate 
the semiconductor. In fact, this electrolyte comparison directly 
illustrates the speed enhancement from incorporation of 
mobile ions, and confirms that this strategy is indeed effective 
in OMIECs beyond PEDOT:PSS, as first shown by Spyropoulos 
et al.[20]
This speed difference is further highlighted when devices 
are operated as ECRAMs under high-speed pulsing. In this 
measurement, charges are injected into the channel during 
ultrashort write pulses, modulating the conductance of 
the device, which is subsequently read using a read pulse 
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). With mere 100 ns write 
pulses, the conductance of the ion gel device can be tuned 
over the entire linear portion of the transfer curve, leading to 
an exceptional dynamic range (>8×) of programmable states 
(Figure 4b). Such high-speed, linear switching is highly advan-
tageous for neuromorphic computing applications.[10] The 
increased electrolyte resistance of the PIL and sluggish diffu-
sion of TFSI anions into p(g2T-TT) limits the charge which 
can be injected into the ECRAM channel during such short 
pulses. Even under 1000× longer (100 µs) write pulses, suffi-
cient charge cannot be injected to modulate the conductance 
state of the PIL device.
Although the relatively sluggish kinetics of PIL-gated 
ECRAMs limit their applicability in hardware-based artifi-
cial neural network (ANN) accelerators, it was hypothesized 
that the unperturbed morphology of p(g2T-TT), as observed 
in GIWAXS, may lead to improved state retention.[59] 
Indeed, we find that the state retention of PIL devices far 
exceeds that of ion gel devices (Figure 4c). The programmed 
synaptic weight of the ion gel ECRAM decays by >12% of the 
dynamic range in 5 min, whereas the PIL ECRAM is far less 
volatile, decreasing by 3.7% of the dynamic range (1.88  µS) 
after 20 min. Achieving state-retention times exceeding sev-
eral minutes in lithographically patterned ECRAMs is chal-
lenging, because smaller devices hold less charge and are 
thus more sensitive to back-diffusion of ions or parasitic 
side reactions resulting in discharge.[26,60] The barrier for 
discharge is increased with the PIL electrolyte compared to 
the ion gel because the OMIEC has less free volume for ion 
motion, and the lack of screening by ion pairs results in elec-
tronic and ionic charges being more tightly bound. Due to 
their short retention times, ion gel ECRAMs are targeted for 
ANN learning accelerators, where the synaptic weights are 
either continuously updated or offloaded to external memory 
for storage. The improved non-volatility of PIL devices on the 
other hand suggests that they are more amenable to write-
once, read-many applications.
We hypothesize that a trade-off exists between the state 
retention of the device and the write speed, and this relation-
ship is tied to the morphology of the organic semiconductor. 
Ion gel devices are significantly faster but have shorter reten-
tion, while PIL devices are slower but have longer retention 
(Figure 4). GIWAXS revealed that the PIL electrolyte retained 
the highly ordered morphology of p(g2T-TT), while the ion gel 
significantly altered the lamellar ordering (Figure 2b). Lamellar 
expansion from ionic liquid uptake improves ionic mobility 
within the material, as greater lamellar spacing allows ions 
to move throughout the crystallites more easily (especially in 
response to ns write pulses). Furthermore, the introduction 
of anion–cation pairs from the ion gel facilitates anionic and 
cationic hole compensation, where both mobile ions can com-
pensate electronic charges in the semiconductor. These fac-
tors increase device speed in ion gel devices, but decrease state 
retention, since the energetic barrier for back diffusion of ions 
is lowered. Importantly, devices made with two mobile ions 
(ion gel) and unipolar (PIL) electrolytes have complementary 
properties which could be leveraged in organic neuromorphic 
systems.

3. Conclusion
We demonstrate how ion gel electrolytes, with mobile anions 
and cations, introduce ionic liquid molecules within the bulk of 
OMIEC films. This ion uptake produces significant structural 
changes within the crystalline portion of the polymer, but the 
charge transport pathways of the semiconductor are unaffected, 
as the interaction of the ionic liquid and OMIEC is largely local-
ized to the side chain lamella. Using in situ SERS, we detect 
evidence of anion and cation movement within the p(g2T-TT) 
film during gating, suggesting that when both ions are present 
within the semiconductor, both ions participate in electronic 
charge compensation during doping. We therefore propose 
that the cation provides another degree of freedom which can 
be used to engineer future OMIEC devices. This passive ion 
uptake can be controlled by deliberately rendering one of the 
counter ions immobile, limiting electrolyte induced structural 
changes, but at the detriment of decreasing device speed. Nev-
ertheless, such unipolar electrolytes offer improved synaptic 
state retention in ECRAM devices, suggesting that electrolyte 
tuning could allow for a single OMIEC to be used in both ANN 
accelerators, as well as write-once read-many applications. We 
further note that the concepts presented in this work are not 
limited to ion gel-gated OMIECs, and we expect these princi-
ples to exist in aqueous OECTs, as well as in other electrolyte-
gated devices such as TFTs and layered 2D materials.
4. Experimental Section
Materials: p(g2T-TT) was synthesized as reported previously.[24] 
EMIM:TFSI was purchased from Iolitec (99.5% grade), dried in a 
vacuum oven, and subsequently stored in a N2 glovebox. The polymer 
matrix, PVDF-HFP, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Mw  [weight-
average molecular weight] of ≈400 000, Mn [number-average molecular 
weight] of ≈130  000) and used as received. Ion gels were prepared in 
a N2-glovebox by dissolving PVDF-HFP and the ionic liquid EMIM:TFSI 
(1:4, w/w) in acetone. The ion gel solutions were stirred at 50 °C for 1 h 
until dissolved. The PIL was synthesized as previously reported,[19] and 
stored in a N2-glovebox. PIL solutions were made by dissolving the PIL 
in acetonitrile.
Device Fabrication: ECRAM devices were lithographically patterned 
using a dry peel-off method described previously,[6] and OECT devices 
were lithographically patterned using a germanium masking process.[61] 
ECRAM device preparation was as follows: substrates were cleaned in 
a sonication bath of isopropanol for 10 min followed by a 10 min UV–
ozone treatment. The semiconducting polymer p(g2T-TT) was then 
spun at 1000 RPM for 90 s and annealed at 60 °C for 60 s. The ion gel or 
PIL solutions were then drop-cast on the devices.
Electrical Characterization: Transfer curves were performed using a 
Keithley 2612 SourceMeter using custom LabVIEW software. ECRAM 
cycling measurements were performed as previously reported and 
analyzed via custom MATLAB software.[6] A 1 kΩ limit resistor was used 
in series with the gate for the ion gel-gated ECRAM to improve linearity. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed using a Bio-
Logic SP-300 using a sinusoidal AC amplitude of 10 mV over a frequency 
range of 1 Hz–3 MHz. Spectra were fit to the equivalent circuit shown 
in Figure S5, Supporting Information, using custom MATLAB software.
Raman Spectroscopy: Raman spectroscopy was performed using 
a Horiba Labram HR Evolution confocal Raman microscope. A 
532  nm excitation laser was used with a power of 880  µW through 
a 100× objective with a nominal spot size of 564  nm. The dispersion 
gratings used were 1800  gr  mm−1 and integration time was adjusted 
to minimize local heating while maintaining sufficient signal-to-noise 
ratios. A confocal pinhole of 100 μm was used to limit scattering signal 
from layers of electrolyte above the OMIEC material.
X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy: XPS was performed using PHI 
VersaProbe 3 XPS with a monochromatized Al source (1486 eV; 50 W; 
200 µm spot size) and a pass energy of 55 eV. The elemental regions 
collected were F1s, O1s, N1s, C1s, and S2p. An electron flood gun and 
low energy Ar+ ions were used to neutralize the sample and prevent 
substrate charging. BEs were corrected to the adventitious carbon peak 
at 284.8 eV. For all collections, the angle between the sample surface 
and the detector was 45°. The spectra were background-subtracted 
using a Shirley-type background and smoothed using the five-point 
linear Savitzky–Golay method using CasaXPS software. Gaussian–
Lorentzian lineshapes were used for peak fitting. XPS samples were 
prepared by spin-coating a PIL or ion gel solution (25 and 22.5 mg mL−1, 
respectively) on clean ITO substrates. The semiconducting polymer 
p(g2T-TT) was then spun on top of the electrolyte and samples were 
measured.
Grazing-Incidence Wide Angle X-Ray Scattering: GIWAXS was 
performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) 
on beam line 11-3 using an area detector and incident energy 12.73 keV. 
The sample to detector distance was 317.06  mm and was calibrating 
using a polycrystalline LaB6 standard. The incidence angle used in 
all measurements was 0.1° slightly larger than the critical angle and 
measurements were performed in a helium chamber to minimize 
scattering from air. All data was corrected for the geometric distortion of 
the flat detector used, normalized by exposure time and monitor counts, 
and analyzed using Nika 1D SAXS[62] and WAXstools[63] software in Igor 
Pro. The terms Qxy and Qz referred to the in-plane and out-of-plane 
scattering vector, with respect to the substrate. The Qz lineouts were 
taken from χ-slices from −10° to 10° with respect to the Qz direction, 
whereas the Qxy lineouts were taken from χ-slices from 0° to 20° with 
respect to the Qxy direction. Peak fitting of the scattering data was 
performed in Igor Pro. Films for WAXS were prepared by spin coating 
p(g2T-TT) at 1000 RPM (5 mg mL−1) for 90 s followed by a 60 s anneal at 
60 °C. The PIL films were spun at 2000 RPM (10 mg mL−1). The ion gel 
was spun at 3000 RPM (10 mg mL−1).
