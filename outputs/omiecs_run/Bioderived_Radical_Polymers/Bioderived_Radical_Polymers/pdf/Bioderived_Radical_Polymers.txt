ABSTRACT: Organic mixed ionic and electronic conductors have emerged as
promising materials for next-generation energy applications, and a variety of
molecular designs have been implemented to push performance to higher levels.
Importantly, nonconjugated redox-active radical polymers capable of charge
transport offer benefits such as ready synthesis in large quantities and the
capability to separate thermomechanical and electrochemical behaviors. This
affords more freedom with respect to macromolecular backbone design; thus, the
resultant materials properties make this class of polymers appealing alternatives
for energy storage. However, these radical polymers often still rely on
petrochemically derived polymer backbones. Here, we demonstrate the
polymerization of the bioderived terpene β-myrcene and its functionalization
by attaching stable radical pendant groups capable of mixed electronic and ionic
conduction. The electrochemical enhancement of these materials was substantial
as the addition of carbon black and doping of lithium salts electronic conductivities of ∼60 S cm−1 were achieved for the composite
systems. The addition of the lithium salts proved fruitful as the electric and ionic conductivities of the radical polymers surpassed
10−4 S cm−1 at elevated temperatures when both lithium hexafluorophosphate and lithium chloride, a more bio and environmentally
friendly material, where introduced to the system. These findings demonstrate a bioderived alternative for an organic mixed
conductor serving as both potential cathode and polymer electrolyte for a more sustainable alternative for energy storage
applications.

■INTRODUCTION
Electronically active polymers have garnered recent interest
due to their potential to supplement or replace their inorganic
counterparts in targeted applications.1−3 To date, the majority
of these materials are π-conjugated polymers; however, the
syntheses of these advanced conducting materials often
includes the use of metal-based catalysts that prove difficult
to remove from the final polymer product, which leads to
potential toxicity and environmental risks.4−10 This is in
tandem with potential for these materials to cause uninten-
tional doping of the organic material that leads to degradation
of long-term performance.11,12 Of particular interest are
oxidation−reduction-active (redox-active), radical-laden poly-
mers composed of aliphatic backbones with pendant stable
radical groups. These redox-active radical polymers are an
appealing alternative and play a vital role in a variety of organic
electronic applications.13−16 These redox-active polymers offer
several advantages, such as the ability to create homo- and
copolymers through various synthetic mechanisms as well as
create materials where the thermomechanical and electro-
chemical properties are not intertwined.17 These synthetic
methods create simpler routes of producing materials with
complex architectures at scale for energy storage.17−21
Additionally, through the selective addition and functionaliza-
tion of pendant groups, preferentially oxidized radical polymers
are useful cathode materials.8,18,19,22 Thus, nonconjugated
macromolecules offer the molecular architecture and thermo-
mechanical properties desired for a variety of energy storage
materials.
At the center of the redox functionality of these polymers are
the stable radical groups.23 A common open-shell group is the
(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl (TEMPO) pend-
ant moiety, which is a frequently used electronically active site
in nonconjugated materials.7,24 Moreover, these pendant
radical groups can undergo rapid charge transfer reactions
with a high degree of stability and withstand the harsh
conditions that can be associated with device performance.25,26

Another crucial factor to the performance of radical polymers
is the charge density of the stable radical sites capable of
undergoing reversible redox reactions along the polymer chain,
as this can strongly impact the ability for these radical polymers
to transport charge.27−29 The nitroxide functionality within
TEMPO is capable of readily undergoing redox reactions and
allowing for electron exchange reactions between neighboring
pendant groups, making it highly effective in energy storage
applications.30−32
TEMPO is a commonly utilized radical bearing moiety in
organic energy storage systems. The Suga and Nishide groups
demonstrated radical content of nearly 100% for a series of
different polymers, including poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidi-
nyloxy-4-yl methacrylate) (PTMA), poly(TEMPO-substituted
norbornene), and a five-membered cyclic nitroxide material
attached to a poly(ethylene oxide) backbone.10,22,33 Multiple
TEMPO-containing cyclic ethers have shown redox potentials
of +3.66 V with a carbon composite cathode relative to a
lithium anode.34 Moreover, the use of a glycidyl-TEMPO
material achieved an electrical conductivity of 0.28 S cm−1.7,8,23
This high conductivity can be achieved across significant
molecular distances when the radical functional groups are
arranged in periodical orders to facilitate charge transport.35,36
Additionally, the Lutkenhaus group demonstrated biTEMPO-
functionalized polypeptides for p-type cathodes in organic
radical batteries, where the battery achieved could undergo
more than 200 charge/discharge cycles without significant
performance drop.37 These examples highlight that organic
open-shell radical polymers have proved to be a step in the
right direction toward sustainable materials for energy storage.
Despite the success that radical polymers have had in
emerging applications, the majority of these TEMPO-
containing polymers are petrochemically derived.38,39 Naturally
derived materials, which contain a variety of functional
moieties that may be leveraged for different applications,
provide an alternative feedstock for polymers. One important
class of functional natural products is terpenes, which are
isolated from essential oils and often contain alkenes or other
moieties useful in polymer synthesis.40−44 Limonene, perhaps
the best known terpene, is used in thermoplastic and
thermoset polymer synthesis; however, often this consumes
the majority of the useful alkenes.45−47 Conversely, β-myrcene,
a monoterpene that contains three alkene groups, can be
polymerized into different stereochemistry linkages that result
residual in-chain and side-chain alkenes.48−50 This has made it
of utility in multiple demonstrations. For example, Constant et
al., produced poly(β-myrcene) and poly(limonene-co-β-
myrcene) polymers suitable for vat photopolymerization 3D
printing as an extension of previous work that had focused on
homo poly(β-myrcene).51,52 Sarkar demonstrated poly(β-
myrcene) elastomers with Mn up to ∼93 kDa, and Anastasiou
formulated green epoxy polymer poly(β-myrcene) epoxide.53
Thus, poly(β-myrcene) may serve as a bioderived materials
platform with controllable alkene concentration, stereo-

chemistry, molecular weight, dispersity, and architecture with
residual alkenes capable of post polymerization functionaliza-
tion.
With these considerations in mind, we evaluated the
suitability of poly(β-myrcene) in redox-active polymers.
Using three different polymerization conditions, a series of
alkene-containing, and later epoxide-laden, polymer precursors
were synthesized. TEMPO moieties were installed onto the
polymer chain at discrete functional group concentrations
while maintaining sufficiently low Tg values, allowing for the
quantification of the impact of the molecular structure on the
electrochemical behavior. These bioderived aliphatic, non-
conjugated, radical laden p-type materials are capable of ionic
and electronic conduction while only requiring small amounts
of external dopants. These energy storage materials achieved
electronic conductivity levels of ∼102 S cm−1 with minimal
carbon black loading. Additional salt loading of these materials
proved to improve electronic and ionic conductivity measures
several orders of magnitude achieving measures of 10−3 S
cm−1. These hole-transporting radical polymers serve as green
alternatives for cathode and electrolyte application and
introduce the utility of bioderived materials as potential
backbone alternatives for energy storage materials in organic
sustainable batteries.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
An, aliphatic, nonconjugated radical homopolymer, poly(β-
myrcene) (PβM), was synthesized from β-myrcene (Figure
S1) using three synthetic methods: a free radical polymer-
ization (FR, Mn ∼4 kDa, Đ ∼1.62), a free radical polymer-
ization with the inclusion of limonene as a mediating solvent
(FRL, Mn ∼5 kDa, Đ ∼2.34), and a reversible addition−
fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT, Mn ∼19
kDa, Đ ∼1.21) (Table S1). These polymers were subsequently
epoxidized into poly(myrcene-epoxide) (PME), where the
epoxide groups were later functionalized with 4-hydroxy-
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (4-hydroxy-TEMPO)
groups through base-catalyzed ring-opening reactions to yield
organic radical-laden pendant groups as the bioderived
energetic poly(myrcene-epoxide) TEMPO (PME-TEMPO),
as shown in Figure 1.
The successful synthesis of the PβM polymer was confirmed
using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The PβM displayed
three characteristic resonances at 5.4, 5.13, and 4.78 ppm,
which are associated with the 1,2, 1,4, and 3,4 myrcene
linkages, respectively, and all three synthetic techniques yielded
materials displaying these molecular architectures (Figures
S2−S4).51,54 The PβM was epoxidized using meta-chloroper-
benzoic acid (mCPBA), previously shown to be successful in
epoxidizing PβMs, yielding PME.55 The successful epoxidation
was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, where the formation
of the peak at approximately 2.75 ppm indicated epoxide
formation, as did the reduction in the characteristic alkene
peaks (Figure S5 and S6).55,56 With the epoxides successfully
attached to the backbone as the pendant groups of PME,
subsequent
ring-opening
reactions
using
1,8-
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) were utilized to attach
TEMPO radical groups to create the radical-containing
macromolecule, PME-TEMPO. An emerging
1H NMR
resonance at 3.98 ppm was observed, and this region is
characteristic of the C−H atoms on the six-membered rings of
the nitroxide functionality of TEMPO. There is also a broad
peak at 3.68 ppm indicating the presence of OH-groups
resultant of the successful opening of the epoxides (Figures
S7−S11). The successful epoxide ring-opening is also observed
in the FTIR spectrum with a peak at 3439 cm−1 corresponding
with the presence of pendant and backbone −OH groups on
the PME-TEMPO materials, consistent with all three synthetic
methods (Figure S12).
As expected, there is a slight increase in molecular weight
observed by shifts to smaller retention times in the size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) chromatograms with each
synthetic step corresponding to larger pendant groups being
attached (Figure 1c). The three synthetic methods resulted in
a larger concentration (∼70−80%) of 1,4 linkages compared to

3,4 and 1,2 with the FRL and RAFT methods producing the
highest percentages of 1,4 linkages which is consistent with
previous findings reports (Table 1).48,51,54 Subspecies were
created of each synthetic method, FR, FRL, and RAFT,
according to the amount of alkenes capable of epoxidation due
to the amount of mCPBA used (FR-50 meaning enough
mCPBA is present to epoxidize 50% of alkenes). With
increasing mCPBA present, an increasing number of alkene
groups were converted to epoxide groups achieving up to 74%
of alkenes converted (Table 1). The ring-opening reactions
allowed for the attachment of ∼50% of TEMPO groups onto
the opened epoxides while showing high control over all the
species (1.1 < Đ < 1.6) (Table 1).
All products had Tg < −40 °C (Table 1). These low Tg
values are advantageous regarding potential additional
processing as they are well below the thermal degradation
temperature of the TEMPO moieties.
The TEMPO radical loading in the polymers is a crucial
factor to the performance of these energy storage materials, as
they are the only electrochemically active moieties in these
polymers. The redox activity of the TEMPO radical was
confirmed using cyclic voltammetry with a peak-to-peak width
of 0.12 V and an oxidation peak occurring at approximately
+0.8 V, consistent with other macromolecules containing
TEMPO radicals, in representative cyclic voltammograms of
FR-200, FRL-200, and RAFT-200 (Figure 2).57 This behavior
is consistent with the PME-TEMPO species on the other end
of the spectra as well (Figure S13). The presence of radicals on
the TEMPO pendant groups was quantified using electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, which showed
peaks in the range of 3480 and 3520 G across all PME-
TEMPO species (Figure S15).
This behavior is consistent with other aliphatic, non-
conjugated redox-active materials containing TEMPO radi-
cals.23,58 Radical content measurements were calculated from
doubly integrating the EPR signal intensities and comparing
with those of a TEMPO−OH standard as 100% radical
content (Table S2). The FR and FRL PME-TEMPO species
generally had higher radical density over the RAFT
formulations with all but two formulations having over 50%
radical content and only one of the RAFT formulations having
over 50% radical content (Table S2). Transporting charge
between radical sites is heavily related to the radical density, so
to narrow the scope of material testing, the four subspecies
with the highest radical content (FR-100, FR-150, FRL-75, and
FRL-100) were selected for conductivity testing (Table S2).
The PME-TEMPO species had relatively low electrical
conductivities (σe) of ∼3 × 10−8 S cm−1, as shown in the
current−voltage plot of Figure S16. This is not unusual for
nonconjugated polymers with low radical functionalization as
they are considered insulators; however, to have any significant
performance, the addition of a conducting filler to achieve
higher conductance values is needed. Carbon is commonly
added to improve conductivity capabilities, particularly in
composite electrodes. Thus, the materials were combined with
5% and 15% carbon black (by weight) to increase the
conductivity values to a suitable level for cathode applications
(Figure 3).37
There was a marked increase in conductivity values
corresponding to the increase in carbon black loading reaching
values >60 S cm−1 at 15% loading, achieving electrical
conductivity values on par with other cathode material
conductivities (Table S3).59 Other studies report significantly
larger carbon black loadings such as 60 wt % and up to an 8:1
weight ratio of carbon black to polymer weight to get
comparable conductivities.37,60 The significant increase in
conductivity indicates that with minimal carbon black loading
(i.e., 5 wt % relative to the polymer), the carbon black additive
is the driving force in the conductivity levels.
Adding ionic salts to composite polymer electrodes is an
effective strategy to create mixed ionic and electronic
conducting energy storage materials.61 To quantify the effect
of salt-mixing on the conductivity of the PME-TEMPO
materials, two lithium-based salts were loaded into the
polymer. The first was lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)
as it is a common salt used in electrolyte solutions for lithium-
ion batteries.62 The second selected salt was lithium chloride

and RAFT PME-TEMPO species showing the oxidation and
reduction reactions of the TEMPO radical. An electrolyte solution
of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in
acetonitrile was used with scan rates of 50 mV s−1and a polymer
concentration of 10 mg mL−1.

(LiCl) as LiPF6 has shown to be relatively chemically instable
and unsafe, particularly when flammable, low boiling point
solvents are used and LiCl has shown to be more
biotolerable.62−64 Respective salt amounts (15 and 30 wt %)
of total sample mass were dissolved in the PME-TEMPO
materials and methanol-chloroform solvent mix and were
subsequently dried under vacuum. Frequency sweeps were
conducted on the raw and salt-loaded materials at temper-
atures ranging from −30 °C ≤T ≤80 °C (Figures S19−S20).
There was an expected rise of conductivity values with the
increase in frequency across the board in all formulations along
with the increase in temperature. To investigate electron
transport as a function of salt loading, upper frequency
conductivities (106 Hz) were measured on a temperature
sweep. The incorporation of Li ions proved to increase the
electronic conductivity of the PME-TEMPO materials
increasing up to ∼10−5 S cm−1 in the LiPF6 loaded
formulations from the pristine PME-TEMPO materials (Figure
4b,c). The higher salt loading (LiPF6 and LiCl) generally led to
higher electronic conductivity levels likely due to the enhanced
mixed conduction of the Li-ion loading providing greater
electron transport properties in the polymers. This could be
due to multiple factors increasing the charge transport such as
ionic-electronic coupling, and electronic and ionic transport.
This was apart from the FRL-100 material as the 15 wt % had a
higher conductivity than the 30 wt % (Figure 4b). Despite
there being a higher ion concentration indicating there should
be a uniform increase in electronic conductivity, the higher salt
loading could affect segmental motions within the PME-
TEMPO materials which would affect the electron and ion
transport of the materials.65 In general, the LiCl loaded
polymers had higher conductivities than the LiPF6 formula-
tions. This is except for FRL-100 formulation at 15 wt %, and
FR-100 at 30 wt % which ranged from three-to-one orders
magnitude of electrical conductivity higher than the mirrored
LiCl formulations (Figure 4b,c). This is likely due to LiCl
being more soluble in the PME-TEMPO materials than the
LiPF6 leading to greater electron−ion interactions and
facilitating higher degrees of electron transport. The 30 wt %
LiCl formulations all had higher conductivity levels in all PME-
TEMPO materials with exception of the FRL-75 formulations
as the 15 wt % LiCl was roughly half an order of magnitude
higher than FRL-75 30 wt % LiCl across the entire temperature
sweep again likely due to the impaired PME-TEMPO
segmental motion from higher salt loading (Figure 4a). All
formulations with both lithium salts were able to achieve

∼10−4 S cm−1 while FRL-75 using 15 wt % LiCl, FRL-100
using 15 wt % LiPF6, and FR-100 using 30 wt % LiPF6 were
able to reach conductivity levels of 10−3 S cm−1 (Figure 4).
With few exceptions, the doping of Li ions provided a
straightforward manner of mixed conduction allowing as much
as an increase of 4 orders of magnitude in electrical
conductivity performance opposed to the pristine PME-
TEMPO materials.
For the PME-TEMPO materials to replace traditional
solvent-based electrolyte mediums, they must be capable of
ion transport. To isolate ionic conductivity in the Li salt doped
PME-TEMPO materials, a similar evaluation was conducted
using poly(ethylene oxide) insulating blocking layers between
the two gold electrodes and the radical polymer and evaluating
ionic conductivity levels at 104 Hz (Figures S22−S23). The
pristine PME-TEMPO materials had baseline conductivity
values of ∼10−6 S cm−1, too low for significant electrolyte
application (Figure 5). In similar fashion with the electrical
conductivity values, the overall ionic conductivity increased
with the presence of Li salt. Ionic conductivity levels increased
at least 4 orders of magnitude across all PME-TEMPO
formulations due to the increase of ion concentration (Figure
5). This highlighted that the incorporation of the increased ion
transport capabilities of the polymer. The LiCl formulations
produced higher ionic conductivity levels than the LiPF6
formulations in all but two formulations: FRL-100 15 wt %
and FR-150 30 wt % both reported higher ionic conductivities
with LiPF6. This is likely due to an increased ion mobility in
those specific formulations and salt concentrations with LiPF6
leading to a higher degree of ion transport. Increasing the salt
concentration in the PME-TEMPO materials generally lead to
an increase in ionic conductivity with three exceptions, the 15
wt % LiPF6 FRL-100 formulation had higher conductivity
measurements (∼2.0 × 10−4 S cm−1) than the 30 wt % LiPF6
formulation (∼7.0 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 80 °C along with the 15
wt % FR-150 LiCl formulation as well having a conductivity
value of ∼2.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 and the 30 wt % LiCl formulation
had a conductivity value of ∼1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 (Figure 5b and
d). This again is likely resultant of the increased Li ion
concentration leading to impaired segment mobility of the
polymer which impairs the ability of ion transport effecting
ionic conductivity. Despite the few exceptions, this behavior
still shows that doping the PME-TEMPO materials with Li
ions provides a straightforward method if increasing the ionic
conductivity. Both Li salts produced formulations with ionic of
10−3 S cm−1 30 wt % salt incorporation at 80 °C, 6 orders of

magnitude above the pristine polymers (Figure 5). Once
doped with the Li salts, the PME-TEMPO materials were able
to achieve conductivity measurements on par with other
electrolyte solutions for ion transport showing potential for a
polymer electrolyte in a battery application.66,67
■CONCLUSIONS
The bioderived PME-TEMPO materials synthesized from β-
myrcene serve as aliphatic, nonconjugated p-type materials
capable of facilitating redox reactions between neighboring
radical sites on TEMPO pendant groups. While in their
pristine (i.e., not doped) states, these materials do not provide
sufficient conductance values to serve as a cathode material or
electrolyte medium, when combined with external loadings or
carbonaceous material and Li-salt, their performances dramat-
ically increase. When blended with as little as 5% carbon black,
the conductivity increased up to 10 orders of magnitude where
similar loadings have reported conductivities of ∼10−7 S
cm−1.68 When blending with either lithium hexafluorophos-
phate and lithium chloride, these materials serve as mixed
ionic-electronic conductors with electronic conductivity values
increasing up to 3 orders of magnitude at 80 °C and higher
frequencies (106 Hz) and ionic conductivity values increasing 2
orders of magnitude at 80 °C and 104 Hz. These elevated
metrics with the combination of external materials show
potential application for energy storage. These materials
provide an attractive, bioderived alternative for cathode and
polymer electrolyte application for sustainable organic
batteries.
