ABSTRACT: This is a study of the eﬀect of copolymer composition on the
electronic conductivity of poly(3-hexylthiophene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (P3HT-
b-PEO) block copolymers. A wide variety of P3HT-b-PEO block copolymers with
P3HT volume fraction ranging from 0.28 to 0.86 were synthesized. Lithium
bis(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) salt was added to the P3HT-b-PEO
copolymers to enable electrochemical oxidation. Three terminal electrochemical
cells were used to oxidize the P3HT microphase; the two outer electrodes were
used to oxidize P3HT, while a nickel mesh located within the P3HT-b-PEO enabled
measurement of electronic conductivity by ac impedance. Symmetric block
copolymers with P3HT volume fractions in the vicinity of 0.5 exhibited the
highest electronic conductivity in the oxidized state. The symmetric copolymers
also exhibited the highest crystallinity. The intrinsic conductivity of oxidized P3HT
microphases increases exponentially with increasing crystallinity.
■INTRODUCTION
Conjugated polymers that are electronically conductive have
been studied extensively due to their potential applications such
as organic solar cells,1−8 ﬂexible transistors,9−13 and
diodes.14−18 These polymers are insulators in the pristine
state, but they conduct electrons in the doped state.16,19−21
Recent studies have explored the possibility of using these
polymers to conduct electrons for enabling redox reactions in
the electrodes of energy storage devices.22−25 However,
enabling redox reactions also requires transport of ions. Thus,
there is interest in coupling electronically conducting polymers
such as P3HT to an ionically conducting polymers such as
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO).25 Like most block copolymer
systems,8,26−32 P3HT-b-PEO copolymers undergo microphase
separation because of the incompatibility of the two
blocks.25,33−36 This results in the formation of P3HT-rich
and PEO-rich nanoscale domains that can, in principle, provide
pathways for simultaneous conduction of electrons and ions.
The eﬃcacy of P3HT-b-PEO copolymers as conducting
binders in lithium battery cathodes has already been
demonstrated.25,35,36 In these systems, a salt such as lithium
bis(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl) imide salt (LiTFSI) is added to
the P3HT-b-PEO copolymers to enable conduction of lithium
ions.
The availability of well-deﬁned ion conducting pathways
enables electrochemical oxidation of P3HT domains, trans-
forming them from insulators to conductors. Patel et al.
developed a three-terminal cell to study the conductivity of the
P3HT domains while monitoring the extent of electrochemical
oxidation.35 In this paper, we use these cells to study the eﬀect
of electrochemical oxidation on a wide variety of P3HT-b-PEO
copolymers. The volume fraction of the P3HT block was varied
from 0.28 to 0.86, and the molecular weight of the P3HT block
was varied from 6 to 14 kg/mol. We show that the conductivity
of oxidized P3HT is a sensitive function of the volume fraction
of the P3HT block, ϕP3HT. Symmetric copolymers with ϕP3HT
≈0.5 exhibit the highest electronic conductivities in the
oxidized state. In addition to electronic conductivity we also
report on the morphology, thermal properties, and ionic
conductivities of the copolymers. We found a strong correlation
between electronic conductivity and crystallinity determined by
diﬀerential scanning calorimetry.
Numerous papers have been written on the factors that
control electronic transport in solvent processed P3HT thin
ﬁlms.9,10,19,37−47 In these studies, carrier mobility in oxidized
P3HT is measured, using either ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors or four
point probes. Such measurements are necessarily restricted to
thin ﬁlms due to the limited diﬀusivity of dopants. In contrast,
the presence of nanoscale channels for the introduction and
removal of dopants in P3HT domains in our system allows us
to probe bulk properties of samples as thick as 250 μm.35,36
This is particularly relevant to electrical energy storage as the
capacity of a battery to store and release energy is proportional
to the thickness of the electrodes.

■EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
A series of P3HT-b-PEO block copolymers were synthesized by the
combination of Grignard metathesis polymerization (GRIM) and a
“click” reaction.25 Azide-terminated PEO (PEO-azide) (number-
averaged molecular weight, Mn = 2 kg/mol) was purchased from
Polymer Source. An Mn = 10 kg/mol PEO-azide was obtained by end-
group functionalization of monomethoxy-PEO that was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.48 Ethynyl terminated P3HT samples (Mn = 6, 10,
14 kg/mol) were synthesized by GRIM.1 1,3-Dipolar cylcoaddition
click reactions between ethynyl terminated P3HT and PEO-azide were
used to obtain the P3HT-b-PEO block copolymers listed in Table 1.
Polymers are labeled P3HT-b-PEO(x-y), where x and y are the
nominal molecular weights of the P3HT and PEO blocks in kg/mol.
Polymers P3HT-b-PEO(6-2) and P3HT-b-PEO(10-2) were synthe-
sized by the method described by Javier et al.25 The other block
copolymers were obtained by performing the click reactions at 70 °C
using a 1:1 molar ratio of CuBr(I) and CuI(I) as a catalyst. The
molecular weights (Mn) of ethynyl-P3HT and P3HT-b-PEO block
copolymers, determined using 1H NMR, are given in Table 1. A
polystyene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) copolymer was
purchased from polymer source. The Mn of the PS block was 386
kg/mol, and Mn of the PEO block was 300 kg/mol.
Mixtures of P3HT-b-PEO and LiTFSI were prepared in argon-ﬁlled
gloveboxes (MBraun) following procedures described in ref 35.
LiTFSI was purchased from Novolyte and dried under vacuum at 120
°C for 3 days. Neat P3HT-b-PEO samples were dried under vacuum at
90 °C overnight. LiTFSI/anhydrous THF mixtures were prepared at a
concentration of 0.4 g/mL. The P3HT-b-PEO samples were dissolved
in anhydrous benzene at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. The two
solutions were mixed to obtain the desired salt concentration and
stirred overnight. Next, the mixture was transferred to a custom built
airtight desiccator in the glovebox. The desiccator was then connected
to a Millrock LD85 lyophilizer located outside the glovebox for 3 days
to dry the samples. The dry P3HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixtures were then
taken into the antechamber of the glovebox, dried at 90 °C overnight,
and taken into the glovebox. All the mixtures had the same salt
concentration with r0 = 0.085, where r0 is the molar ratio of lithium to
ethylene oxide units in the PEO block.
The poly(styrene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) block
copolymer was ﬁrst dried in the glovebox antechamber under vacuum
at 90 °C overnight. Then, in the glovebox, a mixture of PS-b-PEO and
LiTFSI was dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP 99.5% under
Argon, EMD) and stirred at 90 °C for 6 h. The molar ratio of lithium
ions (Li+) to ethylene oxide (EO) moieties in our electrolyte, r0, is
0.085. When the solution was clear and homogeneous, it was cast on a
201 annealed nickel (Ni) foil (All Foils, Inc.) using a doctor blade
(Gardco) and a home-built casting device with a heated casting stage.
The electrolyte ﬁlm was obtained by drying at 65 °C for 12 h in the
glovebox. The resulting membrane was peeled oﬀfrom the Ni foil and
dried in the glovebox antechamber under vacuum at 90 °C overnight.
The PS-b-PEO electrolyte thickness was approximately 30 μm.
Ionic conductivities were measured in two terminal conductivity
cells. Samples were prepared by hot pressing freeze-dried P3HT-b-
PEO/LiTFSI into a 125 μm thick Garolite G-10 spacer with an inner-
hole diameter of 0.476 cm. Nickel foil current collectors were pressed
on both sides of the spacer at 90 °C. Nickel tabs were placed on both
nickel foils. The samples were then sealed in aluminum laminated
pouch material (Showa Denko) using a vacuum sealer (Packing Aids
Corp).
Electronic conductivities were measured in three terminal cells as
described by Patel et al.35 A schematic of the cell is shown in Figure 1.
The P3HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixture was pressed into two separate
spacers described above. The polymer samples containing the 10 kg/
mol PEO block were pressed at room temperature, while those
containing 2 kg/mol PEO block were pressed at 90 °C because these
copolymers have high P3HT content. The mass of the spacer was
recorded before and after the addition of the polymer. The thickness,
L, of each polymer ﬁlled spacer was measured (190−250 μm). An
electroformed nickel mesh (Industrial Netting) was gently pressed
between the two P3HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI ﬁlms at either room
temperature or 90 °C as described above. A nickel foil electrode was
pressed on one side of the composite P3HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI ﬁlms with
the nickel mesh in the middle, while a piece of polymer electrolyte PS-
b-PEO/LiTFSI membrane was pressed on the other side. A disk of
lithium metal (150 μm) was gently pressed on the other side of the
PS-b-PEO/LiTFSI polymer membrane. Nickel tabs were taped on the
lithium, the nickel foil electrode, and the nickel mesh electrode. The
samples were then sealed in pouch material using a vacuum sealer.
The three terminal cell shown schematically in Figure 1 enables
simultaneous control over electrochemical doping of P3HT and its
eﬀect on electronic conductivity. The potentiostat between the
negative and positive electrodes is used to drive dc current which
results in electrochemical doping of P3HT. The potentiostat between
the nickel mesh and the positive electrode is used to apply a small ac
potential that is used to determine conductivity.
Galvanostatic oxidation experiments were performed using a Bio-
Logic VMP3 potentiostat and the Bio-Logic EC-Lab data acquisition
software. A constant current was applied between the negative lithium
metal electrode and the nickel foil of the positive electrode to oxidize
P3HT. The reactions that are assumed to occur in our cells are shown
in Scheme 1.
It is well established that LiTFSI is fully dissociated in PEO matrices
(electrolyte, Scheme 1).49 We assume that Li+ and TFSI−ions are
transferred from the electrolyte into the negative and positive
electrodes, respectively, when current is passed through the cells.
The Li+ ions participate in the plating reaction (negative electrode,
Scheme 1). The TFSI−ions oxidize P3HT (positive electrode, Scheme
1). The oxidation level of P3HT is denoted as rox, the ratio of moles of
electrons (e−) transferred by the potentiostat to the moles of the 3-
hexylthiophene moieties in the positive electrode. The moles of e‑
transferred is given by

chemically oxidized cells were allowed to rest for 30 min prior to the
impedance measurements. All samples were oxidized in steps from rox
= 0 to rox = 0.13.
The impedance spectroscopy measurements were made using a Bio-
Logics VMP3 potentiostat and Bio-Logics EC-Lab data acquisition
software. The potentiostat was connected between the nickel mesh
and nickel foil as shown in Figure 1. The magnitude of the applied ac
voltage was 50 mV with frequencies ranging from 50 mHz to 1 MHz.
Electronic resistance was calculated from the Nyquist plot (−Z″ vs Z′
where Z′′ and Z′ are the imaginary and real impedances). The
conductivity, σ, is given by
σ = L
R
(2)
where L is the polymer thickness, and R is the resistance (Ω·cm2),
obtained from intersections of the Nyquist plots on the Z′ axis. All
conductivity measurements were averaged over a minimum of three
samples, and all reported error bars correspond to one standard
deviation.
Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) samples were prepared by hot
pressing freeze-dried P3HT-b-PEO block copolymer with LiTFSI into
the spacer described above. SAXS measurements were taken at the
Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 7.3.3 at Lawrence Berkeley
National Lab. A silver behenate sample was used as a standard
calibrant. The two-dimensional scattering patterns were collected on a
1 M Pilatus detector. The measured scattering data were averaged
azimuthally to obtain intensity (I) versus magnitude of the scattering

Diﬀerential scanning calorimetery (DSC) experiments were
performed on a Thermal Advantage Q200 calorimeter at the
Molecular Foundry, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Samples
were sealed in aluminum hermetic pans in a glovebox. DSC scans
consisted of two heating/cooling cycles and were conducted over the
range −40 to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min.
■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The eﬀect of electrochemical oxidation on P3HT-b-PEO(14-
10)/LiTFSI and P3HT-b-PEO(6-10)/LiTFSI are shown in
Figure 2, where Nyquist plots obtained at low and high
oxidation levels are shown. At the low oxidation level (rox =
0.005), the Nyquist plots of both samples show three distinct
features (Figures 2a and 2c). Our main objective is to estimate
the electronic resistance, Re, which is indicated in Figure 2. At
the high oxidation level (rox = 0.11), the Nyquist plot shows
only one feature with an electronic resistance that is orders of
magnitude lower than at rox = 0.005. Figure 2 shows the range
of data obtained from our samples: P3HT-b-PEO(14-10)
shows the lowest electronic resistance, while P3HT-b-PEO(6-
10) shows the highest resistance (rox = 0.11).
We expect the electronic conductivities of P3HT-b-PEO/
LiTFSI at a given value rox to be proportional to the volume
fraction of the P3HT microphase, ϕP3HT. We thus deﬁne a
normalized electronic conductivity, σn,e, as
σ
σ
ϕ
=
n,e
e
P3HT
(4)
where ϕP3HT is the volume fraction of the P3HT block in the
neat P3HT-b-PEO block copolymers. In principle, ϕP3HT is the
volume fraction of the P3HT-rich microphase in oxidized
P3HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI mixtures, which is dependent on the
concentration of TFSI−anions. Our analysis ignores the
relatively small changes in volume fraction due to this eﬀect.
In Figure 3a we plot the normalized electronic conductivities
of P3HT-b-PEO(6-2) and P3HT-b-PEO(6-10) as a function of
rox. (All oxidized samples contain LiTFSI. For simplicity, we do
not explicitly mention this in the discussion below.) Both
polymers show σn,e values of about 10−6 S cm−1 at low
oxidation levels. The normalized electronic conductivities of
both polymers increase with increasing rox and reach plateaus
when rox exceeds 0.09. The plateau value of σn,e of P3HT-b-
PEO(6-2) is a factor of 50 higher than that of P3HT-b-PEO(6-
10) in spite of the fact that the molecular weight of P3HT
blocks is identical in these two samples. It is evident that the
volume fraction of the ionically conducting microphase aﬀects
the intrinsic properties of the electronically conducting
microphase.
In Figure 3b we compare σn,e vs rox data for polymers P3HT-
b-PEO(10-2) and P3HT-b-PEO(10-10). These data are
qualitatively similar to Figure 3a except for the fact that the
high oxidation plateau is reached at rox = 0.11. In Figure 3c we
compare σn,e vs rox data for polymers P3HT-b-PEO(14-2) and
P3HT-b-PEO(14-10). The σn,e of oxidized P3HT-b-PEO(14-2)
plateaus at a relatively low value of 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at rox ≥
0.07. In contrast σn,e of oxidized P3HT-b-PEO(14-10) plateaus
at a relatively high value of 2 × 10−1 S cm−1 at rox ≥0.11.
In most of our samples, the added salt, which we assume
resides primarily in the PEO-rich microphase before oxidation,
does not limit the extent to which P3HT microphase can be
oxidized (see Scheme 1).36 The only exception is P3HT-b-
PEO(14-2). It can readily be shown that all of the lithium in the
sample is consumed at rox = 0.07. The plateau seen in Figure 3c
at rox = 0.07 for P3HT-b-PEO(14-2) is due to this eﬀect. The
plateaus seen in all other samples indicate that there is a
threshold beyond which the intrinsic conductivity of P3HT
microphases does not increase with increasing carrier
concentration. It is interesting to note that this threshold
oxidation level depends mainly on the molecular weight of
P3HT block; it has a value of 0.07 when the P3HT block is 6
kg/mol and 0.11 when the P3HT block is 10 or 14 kg/mol.

In Figure 4 we plot σn,ox, deﬁned as the normalized electronic
conductivity at rox = 0.11 vs ϕP3HT. Also included in this plot is
data obtained from a P3HT-b-PEO(6-2) sample taken from
Patel et al.35 It is evident that σn,ox is maximized in symmetric
block copolymers with ϕP3HT ≈0.5. While electronic
conductivity in the oxidized state is controlled mainly by
block copolymer composition, overall molecular weight also
plays a role. We see in Figure 4 that the electronic conductivity
of P3HT-b-PEO(10-2) is higher than that of P3HT-b-PEO(6-
2) in spite of the fact that P3HT-b-PEO(6-2) is closer to a

symmetric composition. We explain this by proposing that the
intrinsic conductivity of P3HT microphases increases with
increasing P3HT molecular weight. We conclude that high
molecular weight and symmetric P3HT-b-PEO copolymers
exhibit the highest electronic conductivities.
Electron transport in block copolymers with an insulating
block such as polyethylene and an electron transporting block
such as P3HT has been extensively studied.12,19,41,42,46,50−59 In
most cases carrier mobilities were measured using ﬁeld-eﬀect
transistors. In all these studies, conclusions about the eﬀect of
the block copolymer composition on electron transport have
been made without normalizing the measured mobilities by
ϕP3HT.41,46,50−59
P3HT-b-PEO copolymers contain nanoscale domains that
transport ions and electrons in close proximity.35 In fact, our
ability to oxidize P3HT depends crucially on our ability to
transport Li+ and TFSI−in the PEO microphases; diﬀusion of
TFSI−in P3HT is expected to be extremely slow. Data
obtained from two terminal cells were used to estimate ionic
conductivity in all of our P3HT-b-PEO/LiTFSI samples using
the methodology established by Patel et al.,35 and the results
are shown in Figure 5a. The error bars for these measurements
are signiﬁcant because the impedance spectra of unoxidized
P3HT-b-PEO copolymers are dominated by the low electronic
conductivity of the P3HT microphases.
The ionic conductivity of block copolymers with one
ionically conducting microphase is proportional to the volume
fraction of the conducting microphase. It is customary to deﬁne
a normalized conductivity as follows
σ

σ
ϕ
σ
f

(5)
where σi is the measured ionic conductivity of the block
copolymer, ϕPEO is the volume fraction of the ionically
conducting PEO microphase, σPEO is the ionic conductivity of
PEO/LiTFSI mixtures at r0 = 0.085, and f is a morphology
factor that accounts for constraints imposed by the geometry of
the conducting phase. We assume that f = 2/3, the value
expected for a lamellar morphology. For P3HT-b-PEO samples
with 2 kg/mol PEO blocks, σPEO = 1.50 × 10−3 S cm−1, while
for P3HT-b-PEO samples with 10 kg/mol PEO blocks, σPEO =
2.20 × 10−3 S cm−1, as reported by Devaux and co-workers.60
In Figure 5b we plot σN,i vs ϕPEO (ϕPEO = 1 −ϕP3HT). The σN,i
values obtained in this study range between 0.7 and 1,
consistent with the literature.61−63
Small angle x-ray scattering SAXS proﬁles of P3HT-b-PEO/
LiTFSI mixtures are shown in Figure 6. The SAXS proﬁles of
P3HT-b-PEO(6-2)/LiTFSI and P3HT-b-PEO(10-2)/LiTFSI
show a primary peak at q = q* = 0.22 nm−1 and 0.21 nm−1,
respectively. The proﬁles also show a higher order peak at 2q*,
indicating the presence of a lamellar structure. The center-to-
center distance between adjacent P3HT domains, d, can be
calculated from

The values of d for P3HT-b-PEO(6-2) and P3HT-b-PEO(10-
2) are 29 and 30 nm, respectively. The SAXS proﬁles of all
other polymers contain weak shoulders which we use to
estimate d (Figure 6). The values of d thus obtained are given
in Table 1. There appears to be no correlation between
oxidized conductivities and morphology as determined by
SAXS. For example, the SAXS proﬁle of the sample that
showed maximum conductivity [P3HT-b-PEO(14-10)] is
similar to that obtained from the sample that showed the
minimum conductivity [P3HT-b-PEO(14-2)]. The factor that
aﬀects oxidized conductivity is discussed below.

Diﬀerential scanning calorimetry traces of all the P3HT-b-
PEO/LiTFSI mixtures exhibited P3HT melting and crystal-
lization peaks in the vicinity of 200 °C. The area under the
crystallization peak was used to quantify the crystallinity of the
P3HT microphases. Crystalline fraction, w, is given by the ratio
of the measured enthalpy of crystallization per gram of P3HT
to that of homopolymer P3HT (99 J/g).64 The dependence of
w on ϕP3HT is shown in Figure 7a. It is evident that w is
maximized in the case of symmetric block copolymers. This
dependence is qualitatively similar to the dependence of σn,ox
on ϕP3HT (Figure 4). In Figure 7b we plot σn,ox as a function of
w on a semilog plot. We show data from all samples except
P3HT-b-PEO(14-2) because oxidation of this sample was
limited by salt availability. The data in Figure 7b suggests that
log10(σn,ox) is a linear function of w. The line in Figure 7b is the
least-squares linear ﬁt through the data which indicates that
log10(σn,ox) = 0.16w −4.81 with an R2 value of 0.98.
The fact that oxidized electronic conductivity P3HT-b-PEO
samples depend only on crystallinity and not on morphology
suggests that the geometry and connectivity of the conducting
microphase is similar in all cases.
■CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated that the electronic conductivity of
electrochemically oxidized P3HT-b-PEO block copolymers is
strongly inﬂuenced by the copolymer composition. Symmetric
copolymers with ϕP3HT ≈0.5 exhibited high electronic
conductivity in the fully oxidized state. Symmetric block
copolymers also exhibited high crystallinity. We ﬁnd a
correlation between the intrinsic conductivity of oxidized
P3HT microphases and crystallinity; intrinsic conductivity
increases exponentially with increasing crystallinity.
