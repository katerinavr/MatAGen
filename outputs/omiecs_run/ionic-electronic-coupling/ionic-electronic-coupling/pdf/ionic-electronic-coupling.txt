The relationship between ionic-electronic coupling and
transport in organic mixed conductors
Scott T. Keene1,2*, Akshay Rao2, George G. Malliaras1*
Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) directly convert between ionic and electronic charge
through electrochemical (de)doping, enabling a wide range of applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic
computing, and energy storage and conversion. While both ionic and electronic transport are individually
well characterized, their combined transport has been difficult to describe self-consistently. We use in situ mea-
surements of electrochemical (de)doping of an archetypal OMIEC to inform a quasi-field drift-diffusion model,
which accurately captures experimentally measured ion transport across a range of potentials. We find that the
chemical potential of holes, which is modulated by changes in doping level, represents a major driving force for
mixed charge transport. Using numerical simulations at device-relevant time scales and potentials, we find that
the competition between hole drift and diffusion leads to diffuse space charge regions despite high charge
densities. This effect is unique to mixed conducting systems where mobile ionic charges can compensate the
accumulation or depletion of electronic charge, thereby screening electrostatic driving forces.

INTRODUCTION
Materials that conduct both electronic and ionic charges through
the bulk of their volume are crucial for emerging electrochemical
devices (1). Among this materials class, organic mixed ionic-elec-
tronic conductors (OMIECs) have emerged as a highly promising
candidate due to their biocompatibility and relatively high free
volume, which facilitates the uptake of bulky ionic species
without undergoing damaging strains. For this reason, OMIECs
have been adopted as a choice material for applications in bioelec-
tronics (2), chemical sensors (3, 4), neuromorphic computing and
memory (5, 6), and energy conversion and storage (7).
While widely used, there still exist many inconsistencies across
descriptions of the underlying OMIEC device physics. One of the
defining features of OMIECs is their volumetric capacitance (C∗),
which results from ion penetration into the bulk of the material,
either displacing (dedoping) or compensating (doping) electronic
charge on the semiconducting polymer backbone (8, 9). For this
reason, most organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) device
models start with a capacitive description introduced by Bernards
and Malliaras (10), which uses C∗to determine the charge carrier
concentration by calculating the local electric potential. Then, the
steady-state carrier distribution and channel current are solved
for using Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s law along the length of the
channel. Friedlein et al. (11) expanded on this model to account
for the carrier concentration–dependent mobility of holes in the
OMIEC channel to better match experimental results.
Recently noted by Kaphle et al. (12), the ionic and electric poten-
tial distributions predicted by capacitive models are unphysical as
they would be expected to drive lateral ionic fluxes along the
channel. Rather than using C∗as the governing equation, Kaphle
et al. (12) used a drift-diffusion model to describe the steady-state
OECT characteristics, yielding an exponential distribution of
carriers along the channel length. However, such electrostatic
drift-diffusion models do not capture the volumetrically capacitive
behavior. Tybrandt et al. (13) have similarly used a drift-diffusion
model to describe behavior for several OMIEC-based devices,
which includes the hole chemical potential of holes near the tail
of the density of states (DOS). In this model, C∗is accounted for
by defining and independently solving Poisson’s equation for two
separate electric potentials corresponding to the ionic and electron-
ic phases where the interface between the phases is treated as a
double-layer capacitor. However, in a wide range of OMIECs,
there are not distinct ionic and electronic phases, with many
single-component polymers (14), and in blends such as poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),
the phases lack discrete boundaries (15, 16). While a wide range
of drift-diffusion models have been applied to OMIECs (17),
none have emerged as a replacement to the commonly used Ber-
nards model (10).
In this work, we build off the work of Tybrandt et al. (13) to in-
troduce a mixed ionic-electronic transport model describing elec-
trochemical (de)doping kinetics, which is compatible with both
electrodynamics and volumetric capacitance by including the hole
chemical potential as a driving force for hole transport. Since the
seminal work by Kroemer (18), it has been well understood that gra-
dients in the chemical potential, or the quasi-Fermi level of carriers,
can effectively act as a carrier-specific electric field, often referred to
as a quasi-electric field. However, this effect is seldom accounted for
in models describing mixed ionic-electronic transport despite the
large changes in hole chemical potential associated with electro-
chemical (de)doping (19). Here, we develop a drift-diffusion
model that accounts for quasi-Fermi level gradients, which drive
hole transport to accurately describe experimental characterization
of ion motion during both dedoping (Fig. 1A) and doping (Fig. 1B)
of the prototypal OMIEC, PEDOT:PSS, at device-relevant
potentials.
The results show that, while initial ionic and electronic currents
are dominated by drift, hole quasi-electric fields drive large diffu-
sion currents, which broaden the internal electric fields and alter

the kinetics of electrochemical (de)doping. We also find that the
motion of holes under the applied field leaves net charge imbalance
leading to ion fluxes, which follow behind holes and are dominated
by drift. This leader-follower relationship between holes and ions
results in (de)doping speeds that greatly exceeds those expected
flux for ion diffusion alone, with the experimental (de)doping
speeds approaching the expected value for ion drift-limited
doping (20–22). Last, we find that steady state occurs when both
the hole and ion electrochemical potentials are uniform across the
OMIEC-electrode and OMIEC-electrolyte interfaces, respectively.
The conclusions of this work question the applicability of device
models that presume that electronic currents in OMIECs are dom-
inated by hole drift under an electric field (10). Instead, the internal
electric fields in operating OMIEC-based devices are likely small
with diffusion driven by quasi-electric fields playing a large role
in both the transient response and steady-state characteristics of
OECTs. Diffusion has been shown to constitute a major driving
force in other mixed ionic-electronic devices, namely, light-emit-
ting electrochemical cells (23–25) where the initial displacement
of ions results from drift, but the steady-state behavior is dominated
by the diffusion of injected carriers. Last, the mixed ionic-electronic
transport model presented here is unlikely to be unique to organic
systems, extending to other mixed conducting systems that undergo
large modulation in electronic carrier densities during operation.

Microscopic measurements of ion transport
We use optical transmission microscopy to monitor ion motion
through a ca. 225-nm-thick, 500-μm-long PEDOT:PSS film
(Fig. 1C) during electrochemical dedoping and doping. The de-
crease (increase) in transmission (∆T/T0) is due to an increase

(decrease) in the absorption of neutral PEDOT chains as PEDOT is
dedoped (doped) (15, 20, 26, 27). The result for dedoping of PE-
DOT:PSS (VWE from 0 to −500 mV versus Ag/AgCl) is a sigmoidal
shape where dedoping happens rapidly at the OMIEC-electrolyte
interface, then broadens with increasing distance along the length
of the film (Fig. 1D). To visualize the dedoping kinetics, we normal-
ize ∆T/T0 between 0 and −1, where 0 is the transmission intensity
before a potential is applied, and −1 is the final transmission after
the dedoping is complete. The broadening of the dedoping front
can be observed as the increasing temporal separation and flattening
of the dashed contour lines, which highlight isointensity profiles, or
transitions across distinct doping levels.
The subsequent doping of PEDOT:PSS from the dedoped state
(VWE from −500 to 0 mV versus Ag/AgCl) shows an increase ∆T/T0
(normalized from 0 to 1), which moves from the electrolyte to the
indium tin oxide (ITO) contact (Fig. 1E). In contrast to dedoping,
the isointensity contour lines show that the doping profile is broad
along the entire length of the PEDOT:PSS film, and the overall time
scale of doping is faster than dedoping, consistent with previous
reports (28, 29).
Following previous work (15, 20), we use the transition across
the halfway point between the initial and final transmission
(i.e., |∆T/T0| = 0.5) (Fig. 1, F and G) to compare (de)doping speeds
across a range of driving potentials, where ∆T/T0 is normalized
between 0 and ±1 for each measurement to better compare across
potentials, which yield different final (initial) doping levels. In con-
trast to previous models (30), the dedoping time shows a weak de-
pendence on potential, with the curves corresponding to VWE =
−0.3 to −0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl overlapping. At higher applied po-
tentials (−0.7 and −0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl), the dedoping fronts
become moderately faster. The doping fronts have a flatter profile
than dedoping fronts and occur over shorter time scales, also
showing a weak time dependence when changing the initial
applied potential (Fig. 1G). We also compare the optically measured
(de)doping times to the time constants (τ) obtained from the chro-
noamperometry current using a commonly used biexponential
decay (31, 32) (Eq. 1).

where I0, I1, and I2 are constants describing the magnitude of
current and τ1 and τ2 are the characteristic time scales for dedoping
(doping) are plotted as a function of the final (initial) VWE. The full
fitting results can be found in table S1. The τ1 and τ2 values show a
similar lack of dependence on the applied potential and, in contrast
to the optical data, show a faster dedoping kinetic compared to
doping (Fig. 1H), confirming that the time scale for (de)doping
of PEDOT:PSS is only weakly dependent on the applied potential.
Quantifying local hole concentrations
The relative transmission intensity through PEDOT:PSS in the
visible range (1.6 to 2.5 eV) is expected to be related to the concen-
tration of absorbing neutral PEDOT chains (28, 33). Thus, ∆T/T0
images should provide quantitative information about the local
change in hole concentration, p. To quantify the relationship
between ∆T/T0 and p, we measured the voltage-dependent trans-
mission spectra (Fig. 2A), which shows decreased transmission at
negative potentials, consistent with increasing neutral PEDOT
chain absorption as PEDOT:PSS is further dedoped. The differen-
tial transmitted intensity (∆T/T0) is calculated with respect to the
transmitted intensity at the beginning of the measurement (T0, VWE
= 0 V versus Ag/AgCl), where ∆T is given by Tf −T0, where Tf is the
average transmitted intensity across the entire sample at the end of
(de)doping (t = 30 s). By taking the integral of ∆T/T0 across the
lamp spectrum at each voltage, we find a linear relationship
between ∆T/T0 and the applied potential (Fig. 2A, inset).
To verify that the typical volumetric capacitance is preserved for
PEDOT:PSS in the moving front sample geometry, we integrated
the chronoamperometry current transients as a function of
voltage for both charging and discharging (Fig. 2B). We find a
linear relationship between the applied voltage and total extract-
ed/injected charge (∆Q), indicating that the confined PEDOT:PSS
charges capacitively and that C∗is constant over the experimental
voltage range. The discrepancy between charging and discharging is
likely due to the presence of oxygen, which can be reduced by PE-
DOT:PSS at negative potentials (34). The linear relationship
between ∆T/T0 and potential and between ∆Q and potential
allows us to relate ∆T/T0 to the local changes in carrier density,
∆p(x), given in Eq. 2 below.

where S is the slope of the curve in the inset of Fig. 2A. Using Eq. 2,
we infer that ∆T/T0 maps in Fig. 1 (D and E) are proportional to the
time-dependent local hole concentrations during (de)doping. A de-
tailed discussion of the experimental conditions necessary for Eq. 2
to remain valid is included in the Supplementary Text. For the high
changes in carrier densities of (de)doping experiments, electroneu-
trality can only be broken at very small length scales (i.e., at the
Debye length), allowing quantification of the local ion concentra-
tions in the film as well. The quantitative measures of hole and
ion concentrations help understand the (de)doping process phe-
nomenologically as discussed in the next section.
Mechanism of (de)doping of PEDOT:PSS
When VWE is applied to the ITO, the electric potential within the
highly conductive PEDOT:PSS should rapidly reach VWE via a hole
displacement current, analogous to a metal-oxide-semiconductor
capacitor. Since the electrolyte is held at 0 V, a depletion region,
and therefore electric field, will form in PEDOT:PSS near the elec-
trolyte interface (Fig. 3A). Then, because cations are free to move
across this interface, they will drift into the PEDOT:PSS, resulting
in dedoping near the electrolyte interface (Fig. 3B). The movement
of ions alters the charge density in the depletion region, leading to a
change in the electric potential profile. Rather than maintaining a
sharp boundary between the dedoped and doped regions of the film
as previously predicted (30), dedoping occurs relatively evenly along
the length of the film, resembling a diffusion-limited transport (see
simulations in fig. S1). Dedoping then finishes when there are no
remaining driving forces for further ion or hole currents (i.e.,
when the internal electric field goes to 0) (Fig. 3C).
At steady state, there must not be any driving forces for hole or
ion motion. Within the PEDOT:PSS film, this requirement is satis-
fied by the lack of internal electric fields or ion or hole concentra-
tion gradients. However, the electric potential difference between
the ITO contact and PEDOT:PSS should drive a hole current.

This inconsistency can be resolved by considering the origin of the
volumetric capacitance. The scaling of charge storage capacity with
volume indicates that the doping is related to the thermodynamic
potentials of holes and ions rather than the penetration depth of
the electric field as is the case for field-effect devices. For this
reason, volumetric capacitance is often described as the change in
chemical potential (i.e., quasi-Fermi level) (ϕp) of electrons or holes
as a function of changes in their concentration (19) described in Eq.
3 below and schematically depicted in Fig. 3D.

This means that, at steady state, ϕp must equal the electric poten-
tial in the ITO contact such that there is no electrochemical poten-
tial gradient to drive hole current across the interface. Since C∗is
constant across the experimental conditions, we can relate the
local hole chemical potential to the hole concentration as described
in Eq. 4 below.

Using Eq. 5, we can estimate the gradients in hole chemical po-

and final potential at the ITO contact of 0.0 and −0.5 V versus Ag/
AgCl, respectively, to calibrate the differential transmission to the
chemical potential of holes relative to the contact.
Drift-diffusion simulations with hole quasi-electric fields
We simulate dedoping and doping cycles using a one-dimensional
electrostatic drift-diffusion model to further capture the experimen-
tal results (Fig. 4, A and B). The simulation uses a time-dependent
forward finite difference discretization method (35) where the elec-
tric potential (V) at each position (x) along the length of the device
is computed by solving the Poisson’s equation (Eq. 6) for each time
step.

which is one fourth of the length of the PEDOT:PSS channel, and
the concentration of mobile cations and anions correspond to the
0.1 M NaCl solution used experimentally (6.0 × 1019 cm−3). We use
constant V condition at the simulation boundaries (Vel = 0 V, VITO

tion boundary. The computed V(x) is then used to compute the flux
of cations and holes. The typical equations used for flux in drift-dif-

oversimplification of hole diffusion in a mixed conducting system.
Specifically, the Einstein relation (Eq. 8) used to describe hole dif-
fusivity does not capture the thermodynamic energy landscape for
holes, which gives the capacitive behavior in the bulk of the material.
As discussed earlier in Eq. 4, increasing the concentration of holes
results in a shift in the hole quasi-Fermi level ϕp (19). To account for
ϕp, we must replace the diffusion term in Eq. 8 to explicitly include
the chemical potential gradient, which will generate a quasi-electric
field that drives diffusion of holes against the electric field (Fig. 3E).
Thus, the diffusion current of holes can be calculated according to
Eq. 10.

The inclusion of ϕp in the diffusion gradient is equivalent to
using the general form of the Einstein relation, which states that
the diffusion constant of charged particles will depend on the dis-
persion relationship (e.g., changes in quasi-Fermi level with hole
concentration) as described in Eqs. 11 and 12.

To ensure p(x) is always positive, we implement a Gaussian dis-
tribution of hole states at tail of highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) (36) with logarithmically increasing chemical potential as
p(x) approaches 0 (Eq. 13).

where we use p0 = 2 × 1019 cm−3 as the crossover hole concentration
where the simulation switches from computing chemical potential
using C∗(Eq. 4) to using the Gaussian distribution of states (Eq. 13).
At these lower hole concentrations, ϕp is dominated by the limited
availability of electronic states at the Gaussian tail of the HOMO
band (36), where ϕp is logarithmically dependent on p. We also em-
pirically account for the voltage dependence of μp using AC mea-
surements of OECTs on the same substrate as the moving front
devices (fig. S2). However, the model still qualitatively matches
the dedoping behavior when a constant μp value is used (fig. S3).
Last, the simulation must compute hole and ion flux across the
boundaries at each end of the film. At OMIEC-electrolyte boun-
dary, the flux of holes and anions is set to 0 and the flux of
cations is given by a modified version of Eq. 6, which adds the
chemical potential gradient for ions across the interface due to
the difference in chemical potential of ions in the OMIEC and elec-
trolyte phases, respectively. This difference in chemical potential is
estimated to be 0.3 eV, which gives a built-in potential across the
PEDOT:PSS/electrolyte interface of ca. 0.22 V, matching the exper-
imentally measured built in potential. The flux at the boundary

Simulation results
The drift-diffusion simulation explicitly accounting for hole quasi-
electric fields due to gradients in ϕp (which we call the “quasi-field
model”) yields dedoping profiles that agree qualitatively with the ex-
perimental results (Fig. 4D). We note that the time and length scale
for our simulations are much shorter due to the high computational
cost. To simulate doping, we use the final state of the dedoping sim-
ulation as the initial potential and carrier distribution then set VWE
to 0 V (Fig. 4E). The doping simulation gives good agreement to the
experiment and shows similar asymmetry behavior to experimen-
tally measured doping (Fig. 1E). In contrast, flipping the potential

as the only driving force is the difference in C+ between the OMIEC
and electrolyte (fig. S4) since there is no potential difference
between the electrode, OMIEC, and electrolyte when VWE is set
to 0 V.
We use the |∆p/p0| = 0.5 contour lines to compare the voltage-
dependent (de)doping kinetics predicted by the simulation to the
experiment. The contour lines calculated with the classical drift-dif-
fusion model show a strong dependence of the dedoping propaga-
tion speed (Fig. 4F). In contrast, the quasi-field model accurately
reproduces the lack of voltage dependence for potentials from
−0.3 to −0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl and the decrease in dedoping
time for higher applied potentials (Fig. 3, G and H).
To leverage the model to infer the ion transport properties for
the moving front experiments, we investigate the scaling of the (de)-
doping kinetics as we scale the channel length, L, ion mobility, μC,
and hole mobility, μp. We find that the time scale of dedoping, t,
scales approximately with L2 (fig. S5), which is typical for both dif-
fusion and drift limited processes. We also find that t scales inverse-
ly with μC and is independent of μp (fig. S6), indicating that cations
are the limiting carrier for the dedoping process. The scaling of the
dedoping time from figs. S5 and S6 is summarized by Eq. 17.
t / L2
μC
ð17Þ
Using Eq. 17, we can extrapolate μC for the experimental mea-
surements. If we extrapolate from the L-dependent simulations in
fig. S5 (μC = 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), we predict a dedoping time of ca.
140 ms, which is ca. 40× faster than the experimentally measured
dedoping time of ca. 5.5 s. Thus, we can estimate a μC of ca. 2.5 ×
10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 from our experimental measurements, where μC
corresponds to the cation mobility in the plane of the film. We
expect that this μC differs from the out-of-plane ion mobility due
to the anisotropy of PEDOT:PSS films (37). Last, we note that our
simulated scaling is only performed in the range where μp >> μC,
thus we expect that Eq. 17 and the qualitative shape of the (de)dop-
ing curves will breakdown as μC C+ approaches μp (27).
We compare the dedoping kinetics of the explored models to un-
derstand the relative contributions of drift and diffusion fluxes
during electrochemical dedoping. If we compare time-dependent
hole and ion concentrations computed using the classical drift-dif-
fusion model (Fig. 5A), diffusion-only model (Fig. 5B), and quasi-
field drift-diffusion model (Fig. 5C), we find a much closer qualita-
tive agreement between the diffusion and quasi-field drift-diffusion
models. If we look at the relative contributions of hole drift and dif-
fusion to the net flux (Fig. 5D), we find that the two fluxes are nearly
equal and oppose one another. The positive hole drift is slightly
larger than the diffusion, leading to a net flux of holes toward the
electrode. Both the drift and diffusion flux profiles along the length
of the film broaden with increasing time due to the broadened elec-
tric and quasi-electric fields, giving rise to the diffusion-like dedop-
ing behavior.
To identify the dominant driving forces for hole and ion flux, we
compare the relative fluxes due to drift and diffusion for our simu-
lations by taking the ratio of the average Jdrift and Jdiff along the
entire length of the film (Jdrift/−Jdiff). For holes (Fig. 5E), drift cur-
rents are larger at short time scales, but with increasing time, the
relative contribution of diffusion increases until the two fluxes are
nearly equal. In contrast to holes, the cation flux is primarily driven
by drift during the entire dedoping process. This result can be ex-
plained as a leading-following carrier relationship between holes
and ions. Since holes have much higher mobilities, they can rear-
range under the electric and quasi-electric fields relatively rapidly.
Then, net hole flux leads to a local charge imbalance locally, thereby
producing an electric field. Last, this electric field drives ion trans-
port, resulting in ion fluxes that are much larger than diffusion of
ions alone.
The diffusive dedoping kinetics observed for experiments using
device-relevant driving potentials ranging from −0.3 to −0.8 V
versus Ag/AgCl contradict previous moving front measurements
of ion motion, which appear to be dominated by ion drift (15, 20,
26, 30). However, these previous experiments were measured under
high driving potentials (−2 V versus Ag/AgCl). To verify that our
model can capture this behavior, we simulate dedoping at similarly
high driving potentials (VWE = −1, −2, and −5 V versus Ag/AgCl).
We find that the ratio of drift to diffusion flux increases markedly
when a higher potential is used to drive dedoping (Fig. 5F), and the
resulting dedoping kinetics appear much closer to the classical drift
diffusion simulation (fig. S7). We therefore attribute the discrep-
ancy between our observations and previous experiments to the
magnitude of voltage used to drive (de)doping. Use of high poten-
tials leads to drift-like kinetics due to the lack of available electronic
states to fill at higher energies, thereby driving electrochemical de-
doping with much higher potentials than the equilibrium potential.
This result further demonstrates the generality of our quasi-field
drift-diffusion model for fitting (de)doping for a wide range of ex-
perimental conditions.
DISCUSSION
We find that hole quasi-electric fields are a substantial driving force
dictating the kinetics of electrochemical (de)doping in PEDOT:PSS
at typical device operating potentials (ca. ±1 V versus Ag/AgCl). On
the basis of this finding, we propose a quasi-field drift-diffusion
model that accurately captures the (de)doping kinetics of thin
films at device-relevant potentials. At short time scales, the
applied potential drives the formation of a depletion region at the
interface between PEDOT:PSS and the electrolyte due to the much
higher mobility of holes (ca. 0.08 to 1 cm2 V−1 s−1; fig. S2) compared
to ions [ca. 1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (20) to 2.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 as
predicted in this work]. Initially, this hole motion is primarily drift
under the electric field, but the gradients quickly become diffuse
due to the high chemical potential associated with sharp hole con-
centration gradients. Diffusion then broadens the electric field as
the quasi-Fermi level of holes in PEDOT:PSS shifts when the
carrier concentration is modulated by ion intercalation. Thus, at
longer time scales, hole diffusion plays a much larger role in (de)-
doping than expected from the ideal gas approximation. In contrast
to holes, we find that the transport of ions is driven primarily by
electrostatics where hole fluxes “lead” and ion fluxes “follow” as
hole displacement currents generate an electric field. For this
reason, (de)doping occurs much faster in PEDOT:PSS than would
be expected for a process limited by only by ion diffusion.
Our quasi-field model predicts that (de)doping speeds only
depend on the mobility of the limiting carrier, which is ionic in
the case of PEDOT:PSS. However, speeds in devices could poten-
tially be improved by operating in the drift-like regime (fig. S7).

For example, a large initial applied bias could be used to inject/
extract ions via drift followed by a holding at smaller bias to let
the channel system to reach steady state. From a materials perspec-
tive, OMIEC design might benefit from higher degree of electronic
order, which would give a narrow distribution in the DOS, leading
to a higher volumetric capacitance C∗(19). Since the electronic
chemical potential is inversely proportional to C∗, materials with
a narrow DOS could be doped to high charge carrier densities
without building up large electronic chemical potential gradients,
which push the kinetics to the diffusive regime.
Our experimental results show that electrochemical (de)doping
of OMIECs results in the formation of broad depletion/accumula-
tion regions, which are much longer (>100 μm) than predicted for
purely electronic systems. This extended space-charge region could
be responsible for nonidealities in OECTs, including the nonmona-
tomic relationship between transconductance (gm) and gate poten-
tial (38) and shifts in the gate potential corresponding to the peak in
gm with changing geometry (39). While many nonideal device be-
haviors may be a result of the dynamic relationship among holes,
ions, the electric field, and hole chemical potential, the presented
model describing transport in OMIECs justifies the use of capacitive
models (10), which can accurately predict most of the phenomeno-
logical behaviors of OECTs, albeit with unrealistic steady-state con-
ditions (12). However, we expect diffusion currents along the
channel due to the gradient in the hole quasi-Fermi level to
account for a large fraction of the current in OECT channels,
indicating that measurement methods for estimating hole mobilities
(40) may need to be revisited.
There are many improvements that can be made to extend the
presented model to understand the structure-property relationships
in OMIECs. For example, the model does not explain the more
rapid speed of doping compared to dedoping commonly observed
optically (28, 41–43), which may be related to an intrinsic asymme-
try in the transport or thermodynamic coefficients of either holes or
ions. Furthermore, the energetic contributions that determine C∗
are likely to be complex, where the DOS (44), mixing enthalpy
(45) and entropy (46), strain (47), and reorganization energies
(48) likely all play a role in determining C∗as a function of
voltage. Further work is needed to fully capture all of the complexity
of (de)doping in OMIECs, including measurements of strains from
ion intercalation (49), contact resistance effects (50), and composite
response in separated phases (51). The current model treats the
OMIEC as a uniform material with effective transport coefficients,
which works well for lengths much larger than the microstructural
features, but at short length scales, we expect the model to fail to
capture the anisotropy caused by microstructural heterogeneity.
Last, extending the drift-diffusion simulations to two dimensions
(12) with different transport coefficients for the and in- and out-
of-plane directions would allow for modeling the more complex be-
havior of devices such as OECTs.
We expect quasi-electric fields will develop due to ion motion in
other mixed ionic-electronic conducting polymers such as

ratio of drift and diffusion fluxes for holes increases with increasing driving potential causing dedoping to become dominated by drift. For comparison, the drift ratio is
plotted for the classical drift diffusion model (black dotted line). The time scale in (F) is normalized to the dedoping time for each potential (100, 13, and 5 ns, and 20 ns for
VWE of −0.5, −2, and −5, and −0.5 V classical, respectively). The dashed lines in (E) and (F) denote where drift and diffusion currents are equal (Jdrit/−Jdiff = 1).

intrinsically insulating enhancement-mode OMIECs and inorganic
mixed conducting materials. For example, there have been reports
of shifts in open-circuit voltage due to shifts in the quasi-Fermi level
due to increasing exciton populations in both organic (52) and
halide perovskite (53) solar cells photovoltaic cells. This effect is
likely exacerbated in ion conducting systems such as halide perov-
skites where ion migration can compensate electronic carriers,
screening the effect of electrostatic driving forces leading to
similar diffusive electronic motion as reported here. Thus, the
framework that relates the quasi-Fermi level shifts to the effective
driving forces of individual carriers, as well as the leader-follower
relationship during electrochemical reactions, will aid in both pre-
dicting and understanding the device response more generally in
mixed ionic-electronic conductors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of PEDOT:PSS
The PEDOT:PSS dispersion was prepared by mixing Clevios
PH1000 (Heraeus) with 6% (v/v) ethylene glycol and 1% (v/v) (3-
glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane, sonicating for 10 min, and
then
filtering
through
a
0.45-μm
polyvinylidene
fluoride
syringe filter.
Device fabrication
Fabrication of transparent samples for optical microscopy started
with 10 min of sonication of ITO-coated boro-aluminosilicate
glass wafers (University Wafer 2544) submerged in acetone fol-
lowed by isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The contact layer was patterned
by coating wafers with AZ 4533 positive photoresist (MicroChem-
icals) (spin coated at 4000 RPM for 45 s, acceleration of 500 RPM
s−1, soft bake at 100°C for 50 s) followed by ultraviolet (UV) expo-
sure (198 mJ cm−2, Karl Suss MA6 Mask Aligner) and development
in AZ 726 MIF developer (MicroChemicals) for 100 s. The pattern
was baked at 115°C for 50 s to improve adhesion between the resist
and substrate. ITO was etched using a dilute aqua regia ITO etchant
solution (A-Gas) for 1 hour and the remaining resist was stripped by
washing the substrate with acetone. Conducting polymers were
coated onto the patterned ITO wafers (spin coating at 1000 RPM
for 40 s, acceleration of 500 RPM s−1). The resulting film thickness-
es were 224 ± 10 nm. Coated wafers were baked at 120°C for 20 min
for cross-linking of (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS)
and soaked in deionized water overnight to remove excess PSS mol-
ecules. The conducting polymer was patterned into 200-μm-wide,
522.5-μm-long channels (10-μm overlap with ITO contact) using
photolithography by coating with AZ 5214E image reversal resist
(MicroChemicals) (spin coating at 2500 RPM for 45 s, acceleration
of 500 RPM s−1, soft bake at 115°C for 120 s) followed by UV expo-
sure (180 mJ cm−2) and development in AZ 726 MIF developer for
20 s. The polymer area was defined by reactive ion etching (recipe,
Plasma Pro 80 RIE, Oxford Instruments) and the remaining resist
was stripped by washing with acetone. The films were exposed to 0.1
M NaCl to allow for passive swelling and uptake of ions. The SU8
capping layer was defined with photolithography by coating the
wafers with SU8 2000.5 (Kayaku Advanced Materials, Inc.) (500
RPM for 10 s, acceleration of 100 RPM s−1 followed by 2000
RPM for 30 s, acceleration of 300 RPM s−1, and then soft baking
at 95°C for 60 s) followed by UV exposure (60 mJ cm−2) and post-
exposure bake at 95°C for 90 s. The pattern was developed in
propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) for 75 s
then rinsed with PGMEA then IPA followed by a hard bake at
120°C for 20 min to anneal the SU8 layer. Finished wafers were
diced with a diamond scribe and tile cutter tool and a silicone
well was defined using an adhesive backed silicone (McMaster-
Carr) to confine the electrolyte.
Optical transmission microscopy
Optical microscopy was performed with a home-built inverted wi-
defield transmission microscope. The sample was illuminated from
the top using a broadband light source (Fiber-Lite DC-950) focused
onto the sample with an OSL2 fiber bundle focusing package (Thor-
Labs OSL2FOC). The sample was fixed to a piezo-driven sample
stage (Attocube ECSx5050/AL/RT/NUM) to control the position
of the sample in the x, y, and z axes and the transmitted light was
captured with a 10× objective (Olympus PLN 10× objective, 0.25
numerical aperture) that was fixed to the optical table. For grayscale
imaging, light was imaged by a tube lens [300-mm focal length (FL),
VIS-NIR–coated achromat, Edmund Optics] onto the camera
(FLIR, Grasshopper3, GS3-U3-23S6M-C). The magnification was
16.7× (350 nm per pixel). The image acquisition was controlled
using custom LabView code.
For spectral resolution, the imaging system was extended by a 1:1
telecentric lens pair (300-mm FL, VIS-NIR–coated achromat,
Edmund Optics) to gain access to an intermediate image and
back focal plane (54). The transmitted light first passed through a
diffraction-limited slit placed in the intermediate imaging plane.
The slit was aligned along the long axis of the sample. Afterward,
an F2 prism (PS852, Thorlabs) placed in the intermediate back
focal plane dispersed the transmitted light orthogonally to the slit
before being imaged onto a 16-bit scientific complementary metal-
oxide semiconductor camera (Hamamatsu, ORCA Flash 4 V3). The
overall magnification was 16.7× (390 nm per pixel) and spectral cal-
ibration was achieved through a series of bandpass filters (FBXXX-
10, Thorlabs) across the visible spectral region. The image acquisi-
tion was controlled using custom LabView code.
Electrochemistry
Chronoamperometry was performed using a Gamry Instruments
Interface 1010E Potentiostat. The sample was connected to the
working electrode and a cylindrical Ag/AgCl pellet electrode (2
mm diameter, 4 mm length) was used as the combined reference
and counter electrode. The initial voltage (VWE,i) was held for 5
min before applying the final voltage (VWE,f,) at which the
moving front measurement was performed. All experiments were
performed using 0.1 M NaCl dissolved in water as the electrolyte.
Electrical characterization
Electrochemical transistors were characterized using a Keysight
B2902A Source-Measure Unit controlled custom Python code. Mo-
bility and capacitance were measured using OECTs on the same
wafer using a previously reported frequency dependent measure-
ment (40). All experiments were performed using 0.1 M NaCl dis-
solved in water as the electrolyte.
Film thickness measurements
Film thicknesses were measured using a DekTak XT Profilometer
with a scan rate of 17 μm s−1 and a stylus force of 1 mg. Each
sample was measured in six locations and averaged.
