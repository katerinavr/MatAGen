Several molecular design strategies 
have been employed to boost the per-
formance of glycolated semiconductors 
for OECTs, including: changing the EG 
chain length,[20] using mixed alkyl/EG 
solubilizing chains[17,21] and altering the 
aromatic moieties in the conjugated back-
bone.[4,11,12,18,22] The success of these strategies is typically evalu-
ated by comparing the OECT steady-state performance, which 
is accomplished by assessing the maximum transconductance 
(gm) that can be achieved in devices[23]

where μ is the electronic charge carrier mobility, C* is the volu-

A series of glycolated polythiophenes for use in organic electrochemical 
transistors (OECTs) is designed and synthesized, differing in the distribution 
of their ethylene glycol chains that are tethered to the conjugated backbone. 
While side chain redistribution does not have a significant impact on the 
optoelectronic properties of the polymers, this molecular engineering strategy 
strongly impacts the water uptake achieved in the polymers. By careful opti-
mization of the water uptake in the polymer films, OECTs with unprecedented 
steady-state performances in terms of [μC*] and current retentions up to 98% 
over 700 electrochemical switching cycles are developed.
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are bioelectronic 
devices that have received considerable recent interest due to 
their ability to track biological activity.[1–10] Among the classes 
of channel materials developed for OECTs, ethylene glycol 
(EG)-functionalized organic semiconductors are particularly 
attractive due to: i) their high OECT performance, rivalling that 
of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) analog bench-
marks,[11–13] ii) the general lack of post-processing treatments 
and solvent additives required to achieve maxi­mum OECT per-
formance,[14,15] iii) their facile synthetic tunability,[11,16–18] iv) the

and length, respectively, VTh is the threshold voltage, and VG is 
the gate voltage.
As highlighted in Equation  (1), the gm depends on both 
material ([μC*]) and device geometry dependent terms (Wd/L). 
A more representative performance comparison of different 
channel materials is thus accomplished by comparison of 
[μC*].[13] Currently, the highest [μC*] recorded for glycolated 
semiconductors is 261 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for p(g2T-TT),[12,13] while 
the highest [μC*] reported for any OECT channel material is 
490 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for Crys-P.[15]
Although OECT steady-state performance is obviously of 
crucial importance, an equally significant but often overlooked 
parameter, is device stability, with few studies focusing on the 
operational stability of the materials during operation.[16,22,24,25] 
This aspect is however particularly relevant for the application 
of OECTs as ion and biomolecule sensors and implantable brain 
signal recorders.[5–7,9] Among the various high performance 
channel materials, the current benchmark, p(g2T-TT), has 
demon­strated devices retaining only 75% of their initial current 
(ID/ID,0) after ≈700 doping/dedoping cycles (2 h of constant elec-
trochemical cycling), hence highlighting the need for more stable 
materials for the commercialization of OECT technologies.[12]
With these considerations in mind, we herein outline a 
new molecular design strategy, by which we successfully 
improved both device performance and operational stability. 
In fact, we report [μC*] values of 522 and 496 F V−1 cm−1 s−1 
and corresponding (ID/ID,0) retentions of 87% and 98% after 
≈700 doping/dedoping cycles (2 h of constant electrochemical 
cycling) for two of our polymers.
The polymer series investigated was derived from the pre-
viously reported p(gT2) homopolymer (from here onwards 
referred to as p(g3T2)).[26,27] Next, the EG length on one bith-
iophene moiety was increased by one repeat unit and simul-
taneously decreased by one on the successive bithiophene 
moiety (from here onward referred to as “side chain redistri-
bution”), affording the alternating diethylene-tetraethylene 
glycol polymer, p(g2T2-g4T2). Further redistributions in the 
side chains led to the alternating monoethylene–pentaethylene 
glycol, p(g1T2-g5T2), and the alternating methoxy-hexaethylene 
glycol, p(g0T2-g6T2), polymers. The polymers’ structures are 
shown in Figure 1a. Note that the average number of EG repeat 
units per polymer repeat unit remained constant across the 
series in this design strategy. An average of three EG units per 
thiophene ring was selected to ensure good polymer solubility. 
Moreover, we envisaged that an alkoxy substituent on each 
thiophene ring could be beneficial towards device stability as: 
i) the lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom directly conju-
gated to the aromatic backbone can donate electron density via 
resonance, thus lowering the polymers’ ionization potential (IP) 
and stabilizing the charged polymer species and ii) the added 
steric bulk from the substituent, should shield the conjugated 
backbone from interfering chemical species.
The synthesis of the polymers involved: i) transetherifica-
tion of 3-methoxythiophene with the corresponding EG chain,  
ii) homocoupling of the resulting 3-substituted thiophene, 
and iii) functionalization of the bithiophene coupling partner 
to enable subsequent Stille crosscoupling polymerization. A 
detailed account of the synthetic procedures can be found in 
the Supporting Information.
The electrochemical properties of the polymers were char-
acterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV–vis spectroscopy, and 
spectroelectrochemistry. Details regarding the experimental 
set-up are located in the Supporting Information. The polymers’ 
onset of oxidation in organic (Eox,org) and aqueous (Eox,aq) media, 
IPs, maximum absorption wavelength in solution (λmax,soln) and 
film (λmax,film), and optical gap (Eg,opt) are summarized in Table 1.
Figure S1 (Supporting Information) illustrates that each 
polymer can be electrochemically switched, reversibly, in 
organic and aqueous media. The presence of two cathodic 
peaks also indicates that the polymers can be oxidized twice 
within the given potential range, consistent with previous 
reports on glycolated polythiophenes.[18,27] As seen in Table 1 the

polymers’ Eox,org and Eox,aq was −0.20 ± 0.10 V, showing that side 
chain redistribution had little effect on the polymers’ electronic 
properties. This was further confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy 
(Figure S2, Supporting Information), where no significant dif-
ferences were found across the polymer series, both in solution 
and thin film. For each polymer, λmax,film was bathochromi-
cally shifted compared to its λmax,soln. Moreover, in the solid 
state each polymer displayed 0–0 and 0–1 vibronic peaks of 
comparable magnitude, thus not only indicating increased 
molecular ordering, but also suggesting similar degrees of 
order in the solid state. This hypothesis was further reflected 
in the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) 
data recorded for as-cast samples of the various polymers 
(Figure S3, Supporting Information), whereby each polymer 
preferentially assumed an edge-on orientation, while featuring 
three-orders of lamellar scattering and no significant π–π  
stacking.
The polymers’ doping mechanism was investigated by spec-
troelectrochemistry.[28] No significant differences were observed 
when conducting the measurements in aqueous or organic 
media (Figure  1b–e and Figure S4, Supporting Information). 
As shown in Figure 1b–e and Figure S4 (Supporting Informa-
tion), each polymer was partially doped under ambient condi-
tions, requiring a negative potential to fully dedope the films. 
Progressively increasing the voltage to +0.2  V resulted in the 
gradual depression of the π–π* peak (highest occupied mole-
cular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
(LUMO) transition) with the concomitant appearance of an 
absorption feature at ≈1050  nm, which was attributed to the 
polymers’ polaron.[29] Further increasing the potential to +0.5 V 
decreased the intensity of this absorption feature which could 
be explained by the possible formation of an even longer wave-
length absorbing feature, related to the formation of polaronic/
bipolaronic species of the polymers.[29,30] Inversion of the 
potential to −0.5  V was employed to test the reversibility of 
the doping process. The optical signature of the polymers was 
fully restored in both media, indicating no polymer degradation 
when cycling the polymers within the given limits. The revers-
ible and stable electrochemical charging of the films suggests 
that these polymers are ideal candidates as cathodes for energy 
applications[31] or electrochromic display applications, such as 
smart windows.[32]
Microscale OECTs were fabricated for each polymer. Full 
details of the OECT fabrication process can be found in the 
Supporting Information. Devices were operated using a 0.1 m 
NaCl(aq) electrolyte and an Ag/AgCl pellet as gate electrode.
As shown in Figure  2, all devices could be operated in 
enhancement mode with the devices’ VTh exactly mirroring the 
polymers’ Eox,aq order. [μC*] was calculated from Equation (1). 
To the best of our knowledge the [μC*] for p(g2T2-g4T2) and 
p(g1T2-g5T2) are currently the highest reported for any OECT 
channel material.[13,15] Note that these [μC*] values were 
obtained without any postprocessing treatments, often required 
for other high-performance channel materials.[14,15]
To better understand the performance difference across the 
polymers, we individually compared the results incurred for C* 
and μOECT. C* values were recorded with electrochemical imped-
ance spectroscopy (EIS) at the VG incurring the maximum gm 
and fit to a Rs(Rp||C) circuit.[12] A good fit between theoretical 
and experimental values was observed (Figure S5, Supporting 
Information). As seen from Table  2 the C* increased from  
156 ± 1 F cm−3 for p(g3T2) to 187 ± 8 F cm−3 for p(g2T2-g4T2), 
while further side chain redistributions resulted in decreased C*  
of 133 ± 3 and 74 ± 4 F cm−3 for p(g1T2-g5T2) and p(g0T2-g6T2), 
respectively. Given the absence of any differences in the 
anticipated doping levels of the polymers as suggested by 
spectroelectrochemistry, we conducted electrochemical quartz 
crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM-D) 
studies to investigate the swelling properties of the films and 
discuss the differing C* of the polymers. EQCM-D was used to 
quantify the changes in mass and viscoelasticity from the influx 
of ions and water into the organic semiconductor.[20,26,33]
Figure S7 (Supporting Information) shows that each polymer 
displayed significant passive swelling upon electrolyte exposure 
in the absence of an applied bias, with the polymers swelling 
on average by 50 ± 15%.  Passive swelling was attributed to 
the diffusion of ions and water into the films.[26] Subsequent 
doping of the polymers by applying +0.5  V increased their 
volume beyond their passively swollen state, which was attrib-
uted to the additional uptake of ions and water into the charged 
films.[26] Notably, significant differences in the active swelling 
were recorded, with p(g3T2), p(g2T2-g4T2), p(g1T2-g5T2),  
and p(g0T2-g6T2) incurring volume increases of 249%, 168%, 
10%, and 4%, respectively. In line with previous studies,  
the polymers’ decreased active swelling upon going from 
p(g2T2-g4T2) to p(g1T2-g5T2) and p(g0T2-g6T2) explained 
the corresponding decrease in C* (Figure  2d).[20] Conversely, 
p(g3T2)’s smaller C* compared to p(g2T2-g4T2) was attrib-
uted to p(g3T2)’s additional swelling not actually contributing 
to any additional anion uptake, but only water (Figure 2e).[20] 
From a mechanistic standpoint, we speculate that the differ-
ence in active swelling observed across our polymer series can 
be attributed to the different abilities of the individual EG-
functionalized bithiophene units to take up and stabilize water 
molecules in their doped state. Specifically, our understanding 
is based on the idea that increasing the EG chain length on 
the individual bithiophene units increases their hydrophilicity 
and ability to take up and stabilize water molecules in their 
doped state. Consequently, we anticipate the 3,3′-dimethoxy-
2,2′-bithiophene moiety (g0T2) to be the least able to stabi-
lize injected water molecules, while progressively increasing 
the number of EG repeat units to one (g1T2), to two (g2T2), 
etc., leads to a progressively increased water molecule uptake. 
Nonetheless, there appears to be a nonlinear positive relation-
ship between EG side chain length and water molecule uptake,

with the relationship seemingly becoming weaker for any addi-
tional increases in the EG chain length after reaching three 
EG repeat units. This hypothesis corroborates the findings for 
an alternative polymer system, in which an initial doubling 
of the EG side chain content in the polymers under evalua-
tion resulted in a ≈600% increase in the active swelling, while  
further doubling the EG chain content only resulted in  
a ≈50% increase in the active swelling.[20]
Given the strong dependence of the electronic transport on 
the swelling of materials,[33] the polymers’ electronic mobility 
trend was also explained with EQCM-D findings. p(g3T2) fea-
tured the lowest mobility of 0.90 ± 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1, while redis-
tributing the EG chains increased μOECT, with p(g2T2-g4T2),  
p(g1T2-g5T2), and p(g0T2-g6T2) incurring mobilities of  
1.72 ± 0.31, 2.61 ± 0.30, and 2.95 ± 0.37 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. 
Note how the increase closely correlates to the inverse of their 
active swelling, i.e., the polymers exhibiting the least swelling 
also attained the highest mobility (Figure  2d). A progressive 
decrease in the hydration level of the glycolated semiconductors 
thus explains the increased mobility.[33]
From the chronoamperometry measurements conducted 
during our EQCM-D studies we were also able to calculate the 
diffusion coefficient of Cl− ions in our polymers (Figure S8, 
Supporting Information); full details of the calculations can be 
found in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure S8 
(Supporting Information), our results indicate that increasing 
the water uptake in polymer films enhanced ion diffusivity, 
thus agreeing with previous literature findings, which have 
shown faster ionic motion to occur in polymer films with a 
higher degree of hydration[34,35]
Lastly, we investigated the OECTs’ operational stability 
(Figure 3) by switching the devices “on” and “off” for 5 s each 
and measuring the (ID/ID,0) over ≈700 doping/dedoping cycles 
(2 h of constant electrochemical cycling). While there is cur-
rently no standard defining the “on” state of the polymers, we 
herein suggest that the “on” state of the polymer should be the

point affording the maximum transconductance. Consequently, 
the applied VG and VD potentials were those that incurred the 
maximum transconductance.
Despite the polymers’ similar energy levels, their operational 
stability varied significantly (Figure  3). While p(g3T2) only 
retained 15% of its initial current, p(g2T2-g4T2), p(g1T2-g5T2), 
and p(g0T2-g6T2) showed much improved ID/ID,0 of 87%, 98%, 
and 98%, therefore also exceeding the 75% ID/ID,0 of the bench-
mark, p(g2T-TT).[12] Comparing the operational stability data 
with the swelling properties of the various polymers highlighted 
a strong inverse relationship between the polymers’ degree of 
active swelling and their operational stabilities. Given the sim-
ilar morphological features of the polymers in their dry as cast 
state and comparable degrees of passive swelling, we attributed 
the increased stability of the polymers with the lowest degree of 
active swelling to the significantly larger volumetric expansion 
during OECT cycling, which is likely to lead to increased mor-
phological changes that are detrimental to OECT performance.
In conclusion, we have developed a molecular design strategy 
based on the redistribution of the pendant EG chains in a series 
of polythiophenes for OECT applications. While this strategy 
did not considerably impact the polymers’ optoelectronic prop-
erties, it significantly impacted their swelling capabilities and 
consequently also their OECT steady-state performance and 
stability. Importantly, the development of p(g2T2-g4T2) and 
p(g1T2-g5T2), demonstrated unprecedented [μC*] values of 496 
and 522 F V−1 cm−1 s−1 and current retentions of 87% and 98% 
over ≈700 electrochemical switching cycles, respectively, pre-
senting a significant advancement in OECT channel materials.
