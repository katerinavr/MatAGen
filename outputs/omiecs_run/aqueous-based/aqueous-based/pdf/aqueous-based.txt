Functionalized polymeric mixed ionic–electronic conductors (PMIECs)
are highly desired for the development of electrochemical applica-
tions, yet are hindered by the limited conventional synthesis techni-
ques. Here, we propose a ‘‘graft-onto-polymer’’ synthesis strategy by
post-polymerization functionalization (GOP-PPF) to prepare a family
of PMIECs sharing the same backbone while functionalized with
varying ethylene glycol (EG) compositions (two, four, and six EG
repeating units). Unlike the typical procedure, GOP-PPF uses a nucleo-
philic aromatic substitution reaction for the facile and versatile attach-
ment of functional units to a pre-synthesized conjugated-polymer
precursor. Importantly, these redox-active PMIECs are investigated as
a platform for energy storage devices and organic electrochemical
transistors (OECTs) in aqueous media. The ion diffusivity, charge
mobility and charge-storage capacity can be significantly improved
by optimizing the EG composition. Specifically, g2T2-gBT6 containing
the highest EG density gives the highest charge-storage capacity
exceeding 180 F g1 among the polymer series, resulting from the
improved ion diffusivity. Moreover, g2T2-gBT4 with four EG repeating
units exhibits a superior performance compared to its two analogues in
OECTs, associated with a high lC* up to 359 F V1 cm1 s1, owing to
the optimal balance between ionic–electronic coupling and charge
mobility. Through the GOP-PPF, PMIECs can be tailored to access
desirable performance metrics at the molecular level.
1. Introduction
Polymeric mixed ionic–electronic conductors (PMIECs), which
can simultaneously transport and couple ionic and electronic
charges, are crucial for a host of technological develop-
ments for bioelectronics,1 optoelectronics2 and energy storage
devices.3 PMIECs are often functionalized conjugated polymers
(CPs),4,5 composed of a delocalised backbone, which supports
the electronic charge transport, while appropriate side chains
allow the ionic transport.6,7 Additionally, the ready variability of
the backbone structure of CPs allows fine tuning of their
properties to maximize performance in various electrochemical
devices, such as the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)8
and energy storage devices.9 For all of these applications, the
interaction of the polymer with aqueous electrolytes is a critical
parameter.10 Ions must enter and exit the film to balance

New concepts
Functionalized polymeric mixed ionic–electronic conductors (PMIECs)
are crucial for a host of applications underpinning societal needs from
energy storage to health technologies. However, functional properties
required for these application domains face synthetic challenges to being
conveyed onto p-backbones and thus combined with efficient mixed
conduction. Here, we present the very first bottom-up approach to
synthesize
a
series
of
functionalized
PMIECs
with
comparable
molecular weights based on a ‘‘graft-onto-polymer’’ synthesis strategy
by post-polymerization functionalization (GOP-PPF). Notably, GOP-PPF
uses
a
nucleophilic
aromatic
substitution
reaction
for the
facile
attachment of functional units to a pre-synthesized conjugated-polymer
precursor. Unlike the typical procedure, such GOP-PPF can largely
simplify time-consuming multiple steps involving diverse side chain
synthesis. In particular, the ion diffusivity, charge mobility and charge-
storage
capacity
can
be
significantly
improved
by
a
rational
functionalization
design.
Moreover,
GOP-PPF
provides
only
one
variation to establish accurate structure–property relationships. Overall,
this work provides design guidelines to approach the functionalized
synthesis of PMIECs and offer new opportunities to explore their
untapped potential.

charges introduced by the redox chemistry of the conjugated
backbone.11
However, classical CPs are often hydrophobic as a result of
their alkyl side chains and aromatic building blocks.12 In order
to promote the ionic conductivity in aqueous electrolytes, the
polarity of the CPs can be modulated to increase their hydro-
philic feature.13 One common approach is to introduce highly
hydrophilic ethylene glycol (EG) or its derivates as side chains,
which facilitates ionic species transport.14,15 Nonetheless,
several studies presented that excessive EG density will disrupt
the favorable molecular packing and bring a loss of structural
integrity, which results in low charge mobility.16,17 Besides, the
overlong EG side chain will lead to a decrease in the electro-
active fraction of the polymers, and thus may cause a decrease
in charging capability.18 Consequently, EG composition opti-
mization is crucial for the design of CPs as PMIECs operating in
aqueous electrolyte.
At present, the synthetic routes towards EG functionalized
PMIECs involve synthesizing monomers with the EG side chain
first, followed by subsequent polymerization with a variety of
building blocks to form the glycolated target copolymers.19,20
However, such synthetic routes have some drawbacks and
processing challenges (see Scheme 1A): (1) challenging mono-
mer purification and low yield have been reported for long EG
lengths, restricting the hydrophilicity tunability;21 (2) to inves-
tigate the impact of EG composition, time-consuming multiple
steps are usually involved in the synthesis of monomers with
variable EG length;20,22,23 (3) when preparing a series of
co-polymers from monomers with diﬀerent EG compositions,
it is often diﬃcult to ensure polymers of comparable molecular
weights due to diﬀering monomer purities and solubilities, and
the variability of the step-growth polymerization.24,25 Therefore,
the EG functionalized CPs from diﬀerent batches likely diﬀer in
the molecular weights and EG composition, which makes it
diﬃcult to decouple the two eﬀects.25 Although the chain-
growth Kumada catalyst transfer polymerization was success-
fully applied to synthesize EG-containing polythiophenes where
the molecular weights are comparable,4,26,27 this is harder
for typical step growth polymerizations like Stille or Suzuki.
Therefore, hindered by the limited functionalization methods
oﬀered by conventional synthesis techniques, the absence of
an eﬀective synthesis strategy poses a major obstacle to taking

advantage of the unique properties of PMIECs to benefit the
development of electrochemical devices.
Post-polymerization functionalization via nucleophilic aro-
matic substitution (SNAr) reaction can overcome the diﬃculties
mentioned above. In this approach, functional groups are
added to a preformed polymer by chemical reaction.28,29 High
yield reactions are required, otherwise the post-polymerization
approach can aﬀord complex mixtures, but it can also allow the
introduction of groups which would otherwise not survive
the polymerization conditions.30–32 More importantly, as post-
polymerization functionalization originates from the same
batch of precursor polymer, the resulting functionalized poly-
mers should have identical chain length, minimizing the
impact of molecular weight variation on the properties and
providing only one variable to access accurate comparisons of
device performances based on the target copolymers.33,34
Here, to unlock a broad range of desired functionalities for
conjugated polymers, we propose a ‘‘graft-onto-polymer’’ syn-
thesis strategy by post-polymerization functionalization for
conjugated polymers, which uses a nucleophilic aromatic sub-
stitution reaction for the facile and versatile attachment of
functional units to a pre-synthesized conjugated-polymer pre-
cursor (Scheme 1B). In particular, we employ this approach to
modify the EG composition on the p-conjugated backbones and
investigate the resulting doping on the coupling between ionic
and electronic species along the polymer backbone in aqueous
media. Such an approach can directly functionalize the back-
bone of a CP by nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr)
reaction.34 Our polymeric framework is based on an alternating
bithiophene and 5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BTf) back-
bone, which as previously reported has a coplanar backbone
conformation benefitting charge transport.35 In addition, we
have previously demonstrated that the fluorine substituent of
BTf can be substituted by various nucleophiles in the presence
of base, leading to a facile route for the introduction of EG of
varying length, specifically 2, 4 and 6 repeating units34,36
(Scheme 1C). The varying EG composition enables tuning of
the PMIECs’ hydrophilicity, charge–discharge kinetics, ionic–
electronic coupling and charge mobility.37,38
Overall, by systemically comparing a family of PMIECs’ redox
behavior and electrochemical properties in energy-storage and
OECTs, we elucidated the role of the EG composition in electro-
chemical performance in aqueous media. In energy storage,
g2T2-gBT6 containing the highest EG density gave the highest
charge-storage capacity exceeding 180 F g1 among the polymer
series, resulting from the improved ion diﬀusivity. For OECTs,
g2T2-gBT4 with four EG repeating units exhibited a superior
performance than its two analogues, associated with a high mC*
up to 359 F V1 cm1 s1 and an OECT charge mobility of
0.99 cm2 V1 s1, owing to its optimal balance between ionic
and electronic transport. Additionally, inferior charge-storage
capacity and OECT performance were both found in g2T2-gBT2,
which is due to the combined eﬀects of low degree of swelling and
mixed ionic–electronic conduction as it has the lowest EG density.
Moreover, the ‘‘graft-onto-polymer’’ synthesis strategy by post-
polymerization functionalization (GOP-PPF) proposed in this
work shows great potential in functionalized PMIEC synthesis,
bringing reliable establishment of structure–property relationships,
and largely enriching the protocols to optimize the performance
of aqueous-based electrochemical devices.
2. Results and discussion
2.1
The EG functionalized PMIEC synthesis
The family of PMIECs synthesized by post-polymerization func-
tionalization are illustrated in Scheme 1C and the synthetic
procedures are presented in Scheme S1 and S2 (ESI†). First,
3-methoxythiophene was treated in turn with 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)-
ethanol and n-bromosuccinimide to give 2-bromo-3-[2-(2-
methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]thiophene in a moderate yield. This
was dimerised by the action of bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel
(0) to aﬀord glycolated bithiophene. This was then stannylated
by dilithiation with n-BuLi, followed by trapping with trimethyl-
tin chloride. Commercially available BTf was polymerized with
the resulting stannylated bithiophene under typical Stille con-
ditions to give g2T2-BTf. Under nucleophilic aromatic substitu-
tion conditions,34 g2T2-BTf was amenable to direct displacement
of the fluorine atom by grafting a series of EG (x = 2, 4, 6) to give
g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4 and g2T2-gBT6. The successful synthesis of
polymeric materials by post-polymerization functionalization was
confirmed by 1H-NMR and 19F-NMR. It is worth noting that these
PMIECs are insoluble in water-based electrolytes, which allows the
characterization of their redox activity in aqueous electrolytes.
Importantly,
the
three
PMIECs
synthesized
by
post-poly-
merization functionalization all originate from the same batch
of g2T2-BTf, which indicates that they share similar molecular
weights. The comparable molecular weights were confirmed by
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using DMF as the eluent
(Fig. S13 and Table S1, ESI†). The number average molecular
weight (Mn) and dispersity of g2T2-BTf were 9.9 kg mol1 and
1.17, respectively. As expected, the EG functionalized PMIECs
present comparable molecular weights (10.1 to 10.5 kg mol1)
and dispersity (1.18–1.20), which enables the resulting PMIECs to
only differ in the length of their attached functional side chains.
2.2
Optical and electronic properties
The optical properties of the PMIECs were measured by UV-vis-
NIR absorption in solution (chloroform) (Fig. S14, ESI†) and
films (Fig. 1a). Both in films and solution, all the absorption
spectra exhibited similar absorption profiles with a dual-band
absorption. A high energy band from 360–510 nm is attributed
to the p–p* transition and a low-energy band from 510–1000 nm
originates from an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).39
In solution, an absorption maximum (lmax) at 640 (395) nm,
725 (422), 727 (423) and 728 (424) nm was observed for
g2T2-BTf, g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4 and g2T2-gBT6, respectively.
When the electron-withdrawing fluoride atom was substituted
by an electron-donating ether group, a red-shift for both bands
was found in all examples. Additionally, the intensity of the
ICT band of EG functionalized PMIECs slightly decreased with
respect to the high energy band, which results from the

weakening of the electron-accepting ability of the benzothia-
diazole.36,40
For the EG functionalized PMIECs, little change in the lmax
or spectrum shape was observed when increasing the EG
length, which is consistent with previous reports.36 Interest-
ingly, a shoulder found around 800 in chloroform for all
polymers was attributed to the aggregation of the conjugated
chains in solution.41 By monitoring the film spectra, the lmax of
the PMIECs all exhibited an apparent red-shift compared with
their solution absorption, indicating enhanced molecular pack-
ing and stronger aggregation in the film state.42 Based on the
film absorption onsets, the optical bandgaps (Eopt
g ) are esti-
mated to be 1.27  0.2 eV for EG functionalized PMIECs,
smaller than 1.33 eV for g2T2-BTf. The larger bandgap of
g2T2-BTf
is
attributed
to
the
relatively
stronger
ICT
character.43 Noticeably, variations in EG composition present
little change on PMIECs’ electronic properties.
The electrochemical properties of PMIECs were measured by
cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 in dry acetonitrile
using Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode. As displayed in Fig. 1b,
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels
were estimated based on the oxidative onset potentials relative
to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an exter-
nal standard. Although the EG density on benzothiadiazole is
variable, the EG functionalized PMIECs exhibited almost the
same energy levels. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) energy levels/HOMO energy levels (ELUMO/EHOMO) were
found to be 3.13/4.46 eV, 3.04/4.31 eV, 3.04/4.30 eV
and 3.02/4.31 eV for g2T2-BTf, g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4 and
g2T2-gBT6, respectively. The g2T2-BTf presented deeper lying
ELUMO/EHOMO with respect to the EG functionalized PMIECs,
resulting from the strong electron-withdrawing character of
the fluorine atom.43 The EG functionalized PMIECs gave
EHOMO around 4.31 eV, indicating that they are prone to be
electrochemically doped in an aqueous electrolyte.17 From the
data in Table 1, the energetics of PMIECs remained constant
even when grafting diﬀerent lengths of EG side chains, demon-
strating that the side chain composition has little impact on the
PMIECs’ electronic properties, which is in accordance with
the optical measurement. Furthermore, the hydrophilicity was
gradually raised by grafting longer EG side chains, which was
supported by the contact angle measurement in Fig. 1c. The
contact angle was 95.21 (1.8), 71.31 (1.4), 65.91 (1.4)
and 60.31 (1.3) for g2T2-BTf, g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4 and
g2T2-gBT6, respectively.
2.3
Electrochemical charging properties in aqueous media
To investigate the relationship between the varying EG compo-
sition and electrochemical redox behavior in aqueous media,
CV measurements were conducted in a 0.1 M aqueous NaCl
solution between 0.3 V and 0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl. As illustrated in
Fig. 2, the potential for the oxidation onset in the aqueous
electrolyte is 0.11  0.01 V for three PMIECs. It is notable
that the overall CV current increases in the following order:
g2T2-gBT2 o g2T2-gBT4 o g2T2-gBT6. This is in contrast to
the electroactive mass of the PMIECs, i.e. the mass percentages

of the conjugated backbone relative to the whole polymer,
which were 46%, 40%, and 36% for g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4
and g2T2-gBT6, respectively. With the greatest relative electro-
active mass, g2T2-gBT2 might be expected to provide the high-
est capacity, but this is not the case. The increasing energy-
storage capacity with EG density thus indicates a positive
impact of the EG side chains on the p-backbone doping.
As illustrated in Fig. 2a, varied diﬀerences in current density
between the 1st and 1000th CV scan were observed. Upon
continuous charging of the polymer films up to 1000 cycles,
the three PMIECs exhibited similar electrochemical stability,
retaining 55%  3% of the initial capacity. The gravimetric
capacitance (Cg) is an important parameter for quantifying
charge capacity of polymer electrodes, which can be obtained
from CV recorded at 50 mV s1 by integrating the current from
0.3 V to 0.7 V and normalizing for polymer mass. According to
eqn (1):44
Cg ¼

(1)
where A is the area under the CV curve, DV illustrates the
voltage window (1.0 V in this case). @V
@t is the scan rate and m
represents the mass of the polymer. The Cg in 0.1 M aqueous
NaCl solution was calculated as 113 F g1 for g2T2-gBT2,
134 F g1 for g2T2-gBT4, and 169 F g1 for g2T2-gBT6. Note
that the Cg calculation came from the first CV cycle. Apparently,
gravimetric capacitance benefits from increasing the EG length.
Furthermore,
the
galvanostatic

(GCD)
measurement for PMIECs recorded at 1 A g1 was displayed
in Fig. 2b. Follow eqn 2:45

where Cs represents the specific capacitance, im
Ð Vdt depicts
the current integral area and the current density (im) is
1.0 A g1. Vi is the initial voltage (0.3 V) and the finished
voltage is Vf (0.7 V), and then the voltage window square
(absolute value) is 1.00 V2. Substituting these values into
eqn (2) gives a specific capacitance of 183 F g1 for g2T2-
gBT6, which is the highest value among the three PMIECs.
Besides, the specific capacitance is 152 F g1 for g2T2-gBT4 and
140 F g1 for g2T2-gBT2, which is consistent with the results
from CV measurements. Similarly, GCD measurements support
that higher specific capacitance was achieved by higher EG
density. In addition, after 1000 cycles, the GCD measurement
was carried out again. A specific capacitance of 74 F g1,
77 F g1 and 97 F g1 was obtained for g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4
and g2T2-gBT6, respectively, which was in accordance with
stability measurement around 55% after the 1000th cycle by
CV. Both the CV and GCD measurements support that the
storage capacity of the polymer electrode can be facilely tailored
via EG composition modification by such post-polymerization
functionalization.
The ability for these PMIECs to function as polymer-based
electrodes in aqueous NaCl solution is attributed to doping of
the p-backbone by chloride ions. As the g2T2-gBT6 presented
the superior storage capacity than its two analogues, we
hypothesized that increasing EG content likely contributes to
enhancing the doping of the conjugated backbone, enabling

faster redox kinetics and better performance for the polymer
electrodes.9 To support this speculation, CV measurements of
copolymers in deoxygenated 0.1 M aqueous NaCl solution
were performed from 0.3 V to 0.7 V at a series of scan rates
(Fig. 3a–c). A linear trend of relationship between current
intensity and square root of scan rate was found in all three
PMIECs, which suggests a diffusion-controlled mechanism of
oxidation/reduction reactions (Fig. 3d).46 According to the
Randles–Sevcik equation for a reversible electrochemical pro-
cess, the Ip(v1/2) relationship can be described as eqn (3):47

(J (mol K)1), T is the absolute temperature (298.15 K), C is

(0.1 mol cm3) and D is the diffusion coefficient of chloride

1010 cm2 s1 for g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4 and g2T2-gBT6,
respectively. Apparently, the higher EG density contributes to
the electrochemical doping of the p-backbone, resulting from
the improvement in ion diffusivity. In particular, the GOP-PPF
provided in this work opens up a synthetic avenue for enhan-
cing the doping of conjugated polymer-based electrodes oper-
ating in aqueous electrolytes.
To further investigate the redox behavior in aqueous media,
the PMIECs’ doping mechanism was studied by in situ UV-vis-
NIR spectroelectrochemistry. We observed similar absorption
spectra changes for all three PMIECs (Fig. S15, ESI†). First, a
loss of intensity of the low energy absorption band (350–
510 nm) and high energy band (510–1000 nm) was observed
at potentials between 0.3 V and 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Specifically,
upon gradually raising the applied bias up to 0.7 V, a new
absorption feature around 1050 nm concomitantly increased,
which was attributed to the formation of polarons.17 Inversion
of the potential to 0.3 V was employed to test the reversibility
of the doping process. The optical signature of the polymers
was fully restored in aqueous media, suggesting that these
PMIECs have potential for electrochromic display applications.

OECT performance
An important application of mixed conduction materials is in
OECT devices. OECTs operate as amplifying transducers, con-
verting small changes in the gate voltage into large changes in
the channel current, with an eﬃciency given by the trans-
conductance, gm, which is expressed as eqn (4):46
gm ¼ Wd
L mCðVth  VGÞ
(4)
The transconductance depends on the volumetric capacitance
(C*) and the charge mobility (m) of the channel materials, as
well as the channel thickness (d), length (L) and width (W), the
gate voltage (VG), and the threshold voltage (Vth). Typically,
the mC* value is the key parameter for evaluating the mixed
conduction properties of the channel material in OECTs.48

ionic–electronic transport, the three PMIECs were studied as
channel materials by fabricating OECTs. The output and trans-
fer characteristics of the OECTs are shown in Fig. 4 and the
corresponding data are summarized in Table 2.
OECTs fabricated using g2T2-gBT4 reached a maximum
drain current of 2.50 mA, much higher than 1.7 mA for g2T2-
gBT6 and nearly 14 times higher than 0.18 mA for g2T2-gBT2 at
the same VD = 0.6 V (VG set at 0.7 V) (see Fig. 4a–c). Similar
trends in the normalized transconductance gm,norm were
observed in the polymer series (Fig. 4d–f). g2T2-gBT2 displayed
the lowest gm,norm due to the combined effects of a low mC*
(40 F cm1 V1 s1, Fig. S16, ESI†) and a large threshold voltage
(Vth = 0.17 V, Fig. S17, ESI†). As reported, the poor mixed
conduction of g2T2-gBT2 is likely due to low degree of swelling
and ionic conduction, which increases the voltage required to
oxidize the polymer.49 Next, the gm,norm increased as the EG
side chain length was increased, and g2T2-gBT4 gave the
highest gm,norm value (161.2 S cm1) among the three PMIECs,
resulting from the significant improvement in the mC* product
(359 F cm1 V1 s1) as well as a decrease in Vth (0.10 V).
Further grafting longer EG side chains in g2T2-gBT6, however,
resulted in a lower mC* (203 F cm1 V1 s1) and decreased
transconductance (95.9 S cm1).
To understand the volumetric doping process of the three
copolymers, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
technique was used (Fig. S18, ESI†). The DCl
 can be calculated
from Nyquist and Bode plots (see Fig. S18 a, b and e, ESI†)
at low frequency, which corresponds to diﬀusion behavior of
Cl.50,51 In particular, the DCl
 is calculated with a value of 3.89 
1011 cm2 s1, 1.68  1010 cm2 s1 and 6.06  1010 cm2 s1 for
g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4 and g2T2-gBT6, respectively, which is
consistent with the values obtained from CV measurement
(see Fig. 3). The volumetric capacitance (C*) systemically
increased as the side chain length was increased (check
Fig. S18 c and d, ESI†), in agreement with the charge-storage
capacity measurements. Furthermore, based on the mC* and C*
values, the charge mobility (m) can be obtained. Note that the
calculated m value (0.99 cm2 V1 s1) of g2T2-gBT4 is the
highest among the three copolymers. As reported, the introduc-
tion of EG side chains can facilitate ion transport in aqueous
media, while some studies also pointed out that too much EG
content would likely result in excessive water uptake during the
electrochemical doping, disrupting the molecular crystallinity
and reducing charge transport in some cases.6,18 In this case,
the highest mC* was obtained for g2T2-gBT4 as it maintained a
balance between electronic charges and hydrated ion transport
to maximize the mixed conduction in aqueous media.
From the transient behavior in Fig. S19 (ESI†), the turn on
time (tON) systematically decreased as the EG length increased,
whereas the turn-oﬀ(tOFF) was unaﬀected. Note that the OECT

transient kinetics agree well with ion diﬀusion measurement
results as the fastest doping speed was found for g2T2-gBT6.
Additionally, the asymmetry in the switching characteristics
between the tON and tOFF was observed, which indicates the
presence of a dissipation process, such as a viscoelastic com-
ponent in the conducting pathway through the channel.52 The
on-to-oﬀcurrent ratios measured are on the same order of 103,
comparable to the state-of-the-art OECTs.20,48 Long term on–off
switching performances were also carried out to test the
stability of the OECTs operating in aqueous electrolytes. Note
that three PMIECs presented similar operation stability of
around 46% for 30 min (Fig. S20, ESI†).
2.5
Microstructure study
To analyze the microstructural features of the polymer films
upon electrochemical doping, we collected ex situ grazing
incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) of the films
in their oxidized condition (doped at +0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M
NaCl solution) (see Fig. 5 and Table S2, ESI†). Evidenced by the
pronounced p–p scattering (010) from the in-plane direction, a
predominant edge-on orientation was observed for all EG
functionalized PMIECs. The three PMIECs exhibited a signifi-
cant in-plane (010) peak at qxy = 1.631, 1.648 and 1.620 Å1
corresponding to a p–p spacing of 3.85 Å, 3.81 Å and 3.88 Å for
g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4 and g2T2-gBT6, respectively. Similarly, a
shorter p–p stacking spacing was also found in g2T2-gBT4 than
its two analogues in the out-of-plane (010) direction. In parti-
cular, the shortest p–p stacking spacing for g2T2-gBT4 could
contribute towards the charge transport,53 which agrees well
with the highest mobility observed in the OECT device. Scatter-
ing profiles exhibited a lamellar diffraction peak (100) along the
in-plane/out-of-plane direction corresponding to a lamellar
d-spacing of 16.06/16.02, 19.87/19.87 and 21.51/21.73 Å for
g2T2-gBT2, g2T2-gBT4 and g2T2-gBT6, respectively. As we
know, the lamellar stacking refers to the separation of the
conjugated and aliphatic moieties.54 With gradually raising
the EG length, as expected, g2T2-gBT6 exhibited the largest
lamellar spacing due its longer linear side chain length.
Furthermore, ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) was
applied to study the correlation between the EG composition
and the morphology of the polymer films, and how the film
morphology was aﬀected by the injection of ions and water
(Fig. S21, ESI†). In the pristine state, the three PMIECs exhib-
ited similar root-mean square roughness (RMS) of 21.6 
0.1 nm. When the films were immersed in 0.1 M NaCl solution,
the surface topographies of all polymer films appeared
smoother with a reduced RMS value. The more even morphol-
ogy in the hydrated state is indicative of a film swollen by ions
and water.16 Besides, after five CV cycles (0.3 V to 0.7 V)
in 0.1 M NaCl solution, a much rougher morphology was
observed, with an increase in RMS value for all three PMIECs.
Importantly, the rougher morphology was ascribed to ions and
water penetration and exit cycles upon electrochemical doping
and de-doping.55 Notably, the most distinctive morphology
change was found for g2T2-gBT6, which was consistent with
electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance dissipation mon-
itoring (EQCM-D) (vide infra).
2.6
EQCM-D measurement
To investigate the eﬀects of EG composition on the swelling
behavior upon electrochemical doping, we conducted EQCM-D
measurement (Fig. S22, ESI†). In Fig. 6a, when the three
PMIECs were immersed in 0.1 M NaCl solution, they displayed
a similar passive swelling around 19.6%. However, a remark-
able swelling change upon electrochemical doping at 0.7 V vs.
Ag/AgCl was observed as the EG length progressively increases.

In particular, an active swelling of 16.7% was found in g2T2-
gBT2, followed by a significant increase to 83.6% for g2T2-gBT4
and 115.7% for g2T2-gBT6. Notably, raising the EG content
would contribute to the polymers swelling upon electrochemi-
cal doping in aqueous electrolyte, which was in agreement with
previous studies.56 As the active swelling of the polymers
originated from the injection of ions and water, the specific
amount of Cl ions and water molecules was calculated. As
illustrated in Fig. 6b, all EG functionalized polymer films took
more water than Cl ions during the doping process, with the
ratios of H2O/Cl uptake being 19.4, 21.6, and 62.1 for g2T2-
gBT2, g2T2-gBT4, and g2T2-gBT6, respectively. This increasing
Cl ion uptake with higher EG density trend is reflected in
volumetric capacitance and energy storage measurements. In
particular, the drop in charge mobility of g2T2-gBT6 fabricated
as an OECT was likely due to the molecular packing disruption
as a result of excessive water uptake.4,57,58 Furthermore, our
results present that polymer swelling upon electrochemical
biasing must be carefully balanced to avoid significant structural
changes, which may reduce the electronic charge mobilities.
3. Conclusion
In this work, we established a new synthesis strategy, the GOP-
PPF method, for largely expanding the synthesizable molecular
design of PMIECs, toward incorporating a wide range of emer-
ging functions. In particular, a series of PMIECs were prepared
with varying EG composition by the GOP-PPF approach, which
otherwise are highly time-consuming by conventional methods.
We found that the EG length has little eﬀect on the polymers’
optical properties, while the hydrophilicity, redox behavior, ion
diﬀusivity, charge storage and charge mobility in aqueous
electrolytes were significantly influenced by EG length, as well
as the performance in electrochemical devices. g2T2-gBT6
exhibits the highest energy storage capacity exceeding 180 F g1
among the three copolymers, which originates from the improved
p-backbone doping, resulting in an ion-diﬀusivity increase. On the
other hand, g2T2-gBT4 gives the optimum balance of charge
mobility and ionic–electronic coupling upon doping, exhibiting
an impressive mC* up to 359 F V1 cm1 s1. Importantly,
optimizing the doping via tunable EG composition is crucial to
maximize the performance of polymeric mixed conductors oper-
ating in aqueous media. Through innovative incorporation of a
nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction into the design and
synthesis paradigm of high-performance PMIECs, we anticipate
that this synthesis strategy will greatly enlarge the molecular
design space and thus enrich the functional properties of PMIECs.
Moreover, we believe that the GOP-PPF method proposed in this
work will accelerate the development where ionic–electronic con-
duction is of paramount importance, including organic thermo-
electrics, energy storage and electrochromics.
