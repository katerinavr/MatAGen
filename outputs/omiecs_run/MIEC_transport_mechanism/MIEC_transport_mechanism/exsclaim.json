We show the cases of an almost perfect lattice (g = 0.5%; a), a lattice with a small amount of disorder (g = 2%; b), a moderately paracrystalline lattice (g = 5%; c), and a strongly disordered lattice (g = 10%; d). The widths of the probability distribution of on-site energies increase as indicated by the arrow in a in the sequence 0, 50, 100 and 200 meV. The energy coordinate is normalized by the inter-site transfer integral at equilibrium, t0 = 150 meV.",

The box depicts the localization length of states in a perfect stack (red horizontal line: complete delocalization) and the band edge in the absence of disorder (dashed line). States with a normalized localization length <2 are considered completely localized. The magnitude of K at room temperature is indicated in h.",
