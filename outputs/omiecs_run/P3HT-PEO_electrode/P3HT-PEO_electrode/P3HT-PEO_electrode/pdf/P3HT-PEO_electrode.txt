Conjugated polymers such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)
have been used extensively as the active material in various
electronic devices such as solar cells,[1] field-effect transis-
tors,[2] and light-emitting diodes.[3] Coupling these conjugated
polymers to ionic conductors allows use of the polymers in
electrochemical energy storage devices, which require the
transport of both ions and electronic charge. The need for
developing new materials for electrochemical energy storage
in the emerging energy landscape, which includes electric cars
and renewable stationary energy, is now widely recognized.[4]
We report herein the synthesis and characterization of poly(3-
hexylthiophene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (P3HT-PEO). Lith-
ium batteries composed of a cathode with LiFePO4 particles
dispersed in a P3HT-PEO matrix, a solid polymer electrolyte,
and lithium metal anodes were assembled. In contrast to
current lithium battery electrodes, which require an inert
polymer to bind the cathode particles, carbon additives for
electronic conduction and a liquid electrolyte for lithium ion
conduction, our system uses one material that serves as the
binder and transporter of electronic charge and lithium ions.
Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of P3HT-PEO. Grignard
metathesis (GRIM) polymerization was used to produce an
ethynyl-terminated, regioregular P3HT (P3HT-1).[5] Regiore-
gular P3HT forms well-defined, nanostructured polymers,
while the ethynyl functional group is required for the next
step. The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition “click” reaction[6] was used
to couple P3HT-1 to a commercially available, azide-termi-
nated PEO, and was performed in the presence of CuI and
diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in THF for 72 h at 408C[7] to
result in P3HT-PEO (detailed experimental procedures and
polymer characterization (Figures S1 and S2) are shown in
the Supporting Information).
Tapping-mode AFM phase images of P3HT-1 homopoly-
mer and the P3HT-PEO copolymer thin films are shown in
Figure 1a and Figure 1b, respectively. Both images show the
nanofibrillar morphology that is usually reported for P3HT
and its derivatives, which results from the p–p stacking of the
well-defined P3HT chains.[8] Both samples have nanofibril
widths of approximately 20 nm, which are consistent with
reported values.[9] The P3HT-1 nanofibrils appear to have a
very compact arrangement with relatively little phase varia-

tion (Figure 1a). In contrast, the nanofibrils in the block
copolymer AFM image are separated by distinct dark regions
(Figure 1b), which could indicate the location of the PEO
block. These observations are consistent with previously
reported data on P3HT-containing block copolymer thin
films.[10] Figure 1c shows small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
profiles obtained from bulk samples of both neat P3HT-PEO
and a P3HT-PEO/lithium salt mixture. Lithium salts are
typically added to PEO to enhance its ability to solvate and
conduct lithium ions. Lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfone)-
imide (LiTFSI) was added to P3HT-PEO by using procedures
outlined in the Supporting Information. The molar ratio r of
lithium to ethylene oxide moieties was fixed at 0.085
throughout
this
work.
The
P3HT-PEO/LiTFSI
mixture
shows a broad shoulder at a scattering vector q = 0.37 nm1,
and an additional, weaker shoulder at q = 0.74 nm1, which
indicate a periodic structure with a length scale of approx-
imately 17 nm. In contrast, SAXS profiles from a bulk sample
of neat P3HT-PEO contained no discernable features (Fig-
ure 1c), as expected. Whilst the AFM images showed nano-
structure formation on the surface of the thin films, it is more
difficult to see ordering in bulk samples of P3HT when using
SAXS. In previous studies on mixtures of LiTFSI and other
PEO-containing block copolymers, it was shown that the
addition of the salt enhances microphase separation because
of the preferential segregation of salts in the PEO block.[11] A
similar effect is observed in the P3HT-PEO/LiTFSI system
and gives rise to periodic structures in the SAXS profile.
The ionic and electronic conductivities of the block
copolymer were determined by impedance spectroscopy and
DC measurements on the P3HT-PEO/LiTFSI mixture sand-
wiched between two nickel electrodes. The Z’’ (imaginary
impedance) versus Z’ (real impedance) Nyquist plot contains
three “semicircles” as shown in Figure 2. This result differs
significantly from Nyquist plots reported for pure electronic
and ionic conductors, which exhibit a single semicircle.[12]
Steady-state current densities, obtained under small applied
dc potentials, were measured and found to be consistent with
Ohms law, and gave a resistance value of 3.78 kWcm2
(Figure 2, right-hand inset). This value is approximately
equal to the sum of the diameters of all three Nyquist
semicircles (R3) shown in Figure 2. Since nickel is a blocking
electrode for lithium ions, the dc experiments must reflect the
electronic resistance, Re, of the sample. The equivalent circuit
shown in the left-hand inset in Figure 2 is the simplest circuit
that can be constructed based on the impedance data. A
similar circuit with two semicircles was proposed for mixed
conduction
in amorphous
poly(p-phenylene)
homopoly-
mers.[13] The elements shown in blue in Figure 2 are necessary
for fitting our experimental data and include capacitance, Qg,
and resistance, Rg, which were previously used to describe
transport across grain boundaries in impedance data obtained
from inorganic mixed conductors.[12a] It is not clear if this
explanation is applicable to our system. The ionic resistance,
Ri,
can
be
determined
from
the
relationship
Ri =
(R3R1)/(R3R1), where R1 is the high-frequency semi-circle
resistance. The conductivity is given by s = L/R, where L is
the polymer thickness and R is the resistance. We thus obtain
the ionic conductivity, si, as (1.09  0.469)  104 Scm1 and
the electronic conductivity, se, as (6.73  2.05)  106 Scm1,
which are consistent with the reported values (note that se is
the electronic conductivity of pristine, unoxidized P3HT).[14]
A full fit of the data using the equivalent circuit in Figure 2
gives Ri and Re values that are within experimental error (see
the Supporting Information for details). Current models[15]
indicate that the performance of battery electrodes are
dependent only on Ri and Re values, and not on other
parameters contained in the equivalent circuit.
After showing that the polymer exhibits simultaneous
ionic and electronic conductivity, the polymer was used as
matrix material in a LiFePO4 battery cathode. The cathode
film was prepared by dissolving P3HT-PEO and LiTFSI in
THF, then adding LiFePO4 particles to the solution and
homogenizing for approximately 5 min. The mixture was cast
on aluminum foil, and doctor-bladed to obtain a smooth film.
The film was dried overnight under vacuum at 708C. All
processing steps were performed inside a glove box under an
Ar atmosphere. All cathodes used in this study contained
50 wt% LiFePO4. Figure 3a shows an SEM image of the film
obtained from the LiFePO4/P3HT-PEO/LiTFSI mixture. The

LiFePO4 particles appear as bright spots and the polymer/salt
mixture appears as a dark matrix. This film is remarkably
simple when compared to a traditional lithium ion cathode,
which contains pores for ionic conduction, conductive carbon
additives for electronic conduction, and an inert polymeric
binder to hold the structure in place, in addition to the active
material. In our system, the active material is dispersed in a
single polymer that functions simultaneously as the conductor
of lithium ions and electronic charge, as well as binder
material in the cathode.
A schematic of the battery cross-section is given in
Figure 3b. To assemble a battery cell, a 1 cm2 circular cathode
was punched out of the cast film and pressed onto a 30–50 mm
thick film made from a mixture of polystyrene-b-poly(ethy-
lene oxide)-b-polystyrene (SEOS)/LiTFSI (see the Support-
ing Information for more details on the SEOS synthesis). The
SEOS/LiTFSI film serves as a solid polymer electrolyte
membrane (Figure 3b), and a piece of lithium pressed onto
the other side of the membrane completes the cell. Several
cells were then cycled from 3.8 V to 2.5 Vat a constant current
density of 0.02 mAcm2. This current translates to a 4 h
symmetric charge–discharge cycle with a 1 h rest step between
each charge and discharge run. The average specific capacities
of ten batteries obtained during the first ten cycles are shown
in Figure 4a, and sample charge and discharge cycles are
shown in Figure 4b. The batteries show a specific capacity
that
approaches
the
theoretical
value
for
LiFePO4
(170 mAhg1) with relatively little capacity fade. This result
provides further evidence that the P3HT-PEO copolymer
delivers both ions and electronic charge to the active centers,
thus allowing the batteries to cycle efficiently.
An important factor is that P3HT is a semiconductor, and
its conductivity can be dramatically altered by oxidation or
doping. It is known that the conductivity of poly(3-alkyl-
thiophenes) increases by several orders of magnitude upon
exposure to oxidizing chemicals such as iodine,[8] or when
applying potentials of approximately 3.2 V relative to Li+/
Li.[16] Results of cyclic voltammetry experiments (Figure 4c)
confirm that this behavior is also valid for the P3HT-PEO
copolymer, where the onset of oxidation occurs at around
3.1 V. It is thus clear that electrochemical doping of the P3HT
block arises from the applied potentials during the charge–
discharge cycles and enhances electronic transport over and
above that obtained in the undoped state (Figure 2). Two sets
of impedance spectra of the entire battery taken during
consecutive cycles are shown (Figure 4b, inset). One set of
spectra was measured at the end of the charge cycle (a,b,c,d),
the second set measured at the end of the discharge cycle
(e,f,g). The overall resistance of the entire cell changes by an
order of magnitude when going from a fully charged to fully
discharged state, and the change is reversible from one cycle
to the next. The possibility of changing the electronic
resistance of the battery in situ offers unprecedented possi-
bilities for control. For example, the bandgap of the electroni-
cally conducting block can, in principle, be engineered to
enable properties such as rapid charging and overcharge/
overdischarge protection.
To summarize, a P3HT-PEO block copolymer that
exhibits simultaneous ionic and electronic conductivity was
synthesized and characterized by a combination of ac
impedance, dc polarization, AFM, and SAXS measurements.
It was found that the addition of a lithium salt increases
microphase separation and enhances the ordering in P3HT-
PEO bulk samples. The polymer was used in a battery
cathode, and cycling experiments demonstrated that P3HT-
PEO delivers both ions and electronic charge to the active
centers. All of the supporting functions required in a battery
electrode are thus performed by a single material. The
