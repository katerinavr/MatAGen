Organic electrochemical transistors are a promising technology for bioelec-
tronic devices, with applications in neuromorphic computing and healthcare.
The active component enabling an organic electrochemical transistor is the
organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor whose optimization is critical for
realizing high-performing devices. In this study, the inﬂuence of purity and
molecular weight is examined for a p-type polythiophene and an n-type
naphthalene diimide-based polymer in improving the performance and safety
of organic electrochemical transistors. Our preparative GPC puriﬁcation
reduced the Pd content in the polymers and improved their organic electro-
chemical transistor mobility by ~60% and 80% for the p- and n-type materials,
respectively. These ﬁndings demonstrate the paramount importance of
removing residual Pd, which was concluded to be more critical than optimi-
zation of a polymer’s molecular weight, to improve organic electrochemical
transistor performance and that there is readily available improvement in
performance and stability of many of the reported organic mixed ionic-
electronic conductors.
Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) are materials
capable of conducting both ionic and electronic charge carriers, and
operate via volumetric-electronic coupling rather than an interfacial
regime1. These properties enable efﬁcient charge storage and signal
transduction, making OMIECs applicable to a plethora of applications,
including
thermoelectric
generators2,3,
actuators4,5,
inverters6,
sensors7–9, light-emitting electrochemical cells10,11, and batteries12–14.
OMIECs are also employed as the channel material in organic elec-
trochemical transistors (OECTs) on account of their low operational
voltages and ability to transduce and amplify an ionic signal into a
readable electronic output15. This, combined with the biological com-
patibility conferred by organic materials, renders OECTs a promising
technology for sensing applications in healthcare settings16, as well as
in neuromorphic computing17,18.

Typically, OECTs are comprised of an OMIEC channel, separating
a source and a drain electrode, coupled to a gate electrode through an
electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. 1). Application of a gate voltage (VG)
drives ions from the electrolyte into the OMIEC. These compensate
electronic charges in the channel, which in turn modulates the OMIEC
channel conductivity. Channel currents driven by an applied source-
drain bias are sensitive to the gate-induced channel conductance
modulation, thus allowing for gate signals to be transduced and
ampliﬁed. This difference between the three-dimensional nature of
OECTs and the interfacial operation of organic thin ﬁlm transistors
(OTFTs)19 presents new challenges to current understanding and
indicates that previous assumptions on the similarity of OTFTs and
OECTs may not hold true3.
The performance of OECT devices is typically evaluated by
examining the steady-state electrical performance, which can be
represented by the maximum transconductance (gm) achieved in
devices, calculated from:
gm = μC* Wd
L
V TH  V g


ð1Þ
where μ is the electronic charge carrier mobility, C* is the volumetric
capacitance, W, d, and L are the channel width, depth and length
respectively, VTH is the threshold voltage and Vg is the gate voltage20.
Transconductance is a direct measure of an OECT’s ability to amplify a
signal, which can be critical for certain applications, such as in bio-
sensing, where a small ionic ﬂuctuation can betransduced into a larger,
readable electronic output. Equation (1) highlights the dependence of
gm on both material properties (μC*) and device geometry (Wd/L). As
an alternative ﬁgure-of-merit to gm for understanding the performance
of an OECT and to allow for direct material comparisons, the product
μC*
is
commonly
employed
instead,
to
eliminate
geometry
dependence21. Other important parameters when considering the
application of an OECT include the ON/OFF ratio and the switching
speed. The ON/OFF ratio, similar to an OFET, refers to the ratio of the
maximum Id recorded at a particular VD, and the Id measured in the OFF
state. Ideal transistors exhibit a low ON resistance and extremely high
OFF resistance, which result in a high ON/OFF ratio. A low number (i.e.,
a high OFF current) is indicative of current leakage or ambient doping
of the semiconductor material. Alternatively, a low mobility (i.e., a low
ON current) would also result in a low ON/OFF ratio, thus maximizing
the charge carrier mobility is critical for meaningful device applica-
tions beyond achieving the highest possible μC*. The switching speed
is also critical when considering oscillations in brain activity, for
example,
which
can
occur
on
frequencies
in
the
range
of
0.5–200 Hz15,22. Currently, OECTs are able to achieve switching speeds
in the microsecond timescales.
One factor that has been demonstrated to inﬂuence the perfor-
mance of organic semiconducting polymers is the molecular weight.
Typically in the ﬁeld of organic transistors and molecular weight stu-
dies, the number average molecular weight, Mn is the most widely
reported23–28. Mn is deﬁned as the total weight of the polymer divided
by the total number of polymer chains, and the dispersity (Ð) is a
measure of the distribution of the molecular weight within a sample,
with a Ð of one being optimal and indicating all polymer chains are of
equal length. Information on the methods of measuring molecular
weight and their respective advantages and limitations are detailed in
the Supplementary Information.
Many studies have been carried out on the relationship between
charge carrier mobility in OTFTs and the molecular weight of the
organic semiconducting layer, arising from mainly morphological
factors29–33. Less is known about the inﬂuence of molecular weight in
OECT devices that mostly differ from OTFTs by the swelling and bulk
doping of the active layer due to ion penetration/expulsion. The
dependence of OTFT performance on the molecular weight of the
active semiconductor has typically focused on poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT), where both individual batches and blends of different mole-
cular weights have been examined30,31,33,34. Longer polymer chains,
occurring in higher molecular weight batches, act as tie chains, con-
necting crystalline domains and maximizing charge carrier mobilities.
This was conﬁrmed by blending low and high molecular weight bat-
ches of P3HT in varying percentages, until a plateau was reached in the
OTFT mobility31. Without the addition of higher molecular weight
polymer chains to act as tie chains, the frequency and prominence of
the grain boundaries between crystalline regions force charges to
move by unfavorable hopping events, severely limiting the charge
carrier mobility29. Based on OTFT studies, a decrease in the electronic
mobility might be expected with lower molecular weight but studies
using blended systems demonstrated that more favorable morphol-
ogy can arise from an intermediate molecular weight35. Although this
has been shown for ladder-type polymers36, conventional OECT
materials, such as polythiophene or naphthalenediimide (NDI)-based
polymers, have a less rigid structure. Thus, the link between molecular
weight of ladder-type polymers and OECT performance cannot be
translated directly to other OMIECs and the relationship between
OECT performance and OMIEC molecular weight has not been
decoupled yet.
Additionally, the puriﬁcation of OMIEC polymers is rarely con-
sidered. The vast majority of OMIEC conjugated polymers are syn-
thesized using Pd-mediated cross-coupling conditions19,24,25,28,37,38 and
these materials are typically only puriﬁed by simple Soxhlet extraction
in numerous solvents, which removes limited amounts of residual
metal impurities. Speciﬁcally, Stille polymerizations make use of
around 3000–5000 ppm of Pd, and while Soxhlet extraction can
reduce levels by an order of magnitude, this may not be sufﬁcient to
maximize performance39. These levels have been shown to impact OPV
applications40, as residual metals, such as palladium (Pd), may act as a
charge sink, trapping mobile charges and reducing charge transport
properties39,41. Alternatively, Pd can act as a co-catalyst to facilitate
charge transfer and catalyze redox reactions of ambient species (i.e., in
the operation conditions used in OECT but not OTFT applications)42,
including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which generates toxic
hydrogen peroxide, making impure OMIECs unsuitable for bioelec-
tronic applications.
Herein, we present an investigation into the impact of purity (the
level of residual Pd) and molecular weight of the most common p-type
and n-type backbones (polythiophene and NDI, respectively, Fig. 1a) on
the OECT performance. These were prepared by standard Stille poly-
merizations, using 2 mol% Pd catalyst (which equates to ~3000 ppm
for p(g4T2-TT) and ~4,900 ppm for p(C6g3NDI-T)), and the different
molecular weights were obtained by preparative GPC (Fig. 1b, c), which
conveniently offers the ability to narrow Ð whilst simultaneously
removing residual metal impurities. The optoelectronic properties,
OECT performance, and structural properties using grazing incidence
wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) of four molecular weight frac-
tions of Ð < 2 (Table 1) of polymers p(g4T2-TT) and p(C6g3NDI-T) were
studied and compared to the unpuriﬁed polymer (i.e., the polymer
after standard Soxhlet procedure but pre-fractionation). In particular,
the impact of purity on the OECT performance was probed (Fig. 1).
This study utilizes an alternative method for OMIEC puriﬁcation,
by more thoroughly removing by-products than only using traditional
Soxhlet puriﬁcation. Preparative GPC is also particularly useful for
studying the impact of molecular weight as any batch-to-batch varia-
tions are removed. One batch is simply divided into several fractions of
lower dispersity instead of synthesizing new batches through different
reaction conditions, making this the most comprehensive method for
comparing molecular weights.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis
The synthetic routes to p(g4T2-TT) and p(C6g3NDI-T) are shown in
Supplementary Figs. 2–5. Monomer 13,13’-((5,5’-dibromo-[2,2’-bithio-
phene]-3,3’-diyl)bis(oxy))bis(2,5,8,11-tetraoxatridecane) (g4T2Br2) was
synthesized through a modiﬁed literature procedure, by utilizing a
copper(I) iodide catalyst to decorate the 3,3’-dibromo-2,2’-bithiophene
core with tetraethylene glycolated side chains, followed by a typical
bromination using N-bromosuccinimide to generate the monomer in a
56% yield (Supplementary Fig. 6)43. Alternatively, 4,9-dibromo-2,7-
di(2,5,8,11-tetraoxaheptadecan-17-yl)benzo[lmn][3,8]phenanthroline-
1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone (C6g3NDI-Br2) was prepared from 2,6-dibro-
monaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (NDA-Br2) using a
single step procedure, by treating NDA-Br2 with 2,5,8,11-tetra-
oxaheptadecan-17-amine (Supplementary Fig. 7)24. Lastly, both p(g4T2-
TT) and p(C6g3NDI-T) were synthesized via Stille polymerization
reactions of g4T2Br2 or C6g3NDI-Br2 respectively, with equimolar
quantities of the appropriate stannylated thiophene derivative (Sup-
plementary Figs. 8 and 9). Each polymer was initially puriﬁed using the
traditional Soxhlet puriﬁcation method. While this has been docu-
mented as a method for separating molecular weights44, the dis-
advantage is that fractions eluting later will likely have a higher purity
than those eluted ﬁrst. Furthermore, none of these polymers were
soluble in the Soxhlet solvents used prior to chloroform, so the dis-
persity could not be reduced by this method. Instead, we employed
preparative GPC to separate a single batch of polymer into four
molecular weight fractions, such that each fraction contained
approximately the same amount of material, with the ﬁrst fraction
collected (fraction 1) being of highest molecular weight (Fig. 1b, c).
Preparative GPC can also be viewed as an additional method of pur-
iﬁcation, as remaining impurities (typically Pd from the catalyst) are of
different molecular weight than any polymer chains, thus are dis-
carded before or after the elution of the polymer.
Materials’ properties
Analytical GPC was employed to estimate the molecular weights of the
two series of polymers and their weight fractions, with dimethylfor-
mamide and chloroform as eluent for p(g4T2-TT) and p(C6g3NDI-T),
respectively. The measurements were conducted at 40 °C with respect
to polystyrene standards. The values obtained are summarized in
Table 1. It should be noted that despite glycolated polymers often

exhibiting a bimodal distribution from GPC19,25, these polymers, par-
ticularly once fractionated, showed ideal unimodal traces (Supple-
mentary Figs. 10–12). This is expected, as the preparative GPC used for
fractionation relies upon the same size exclusion method as the
analytical GPC.
The two series’ optoelectronic properties are summarized in
Table 1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexa-
ﬂuorophosphate (TBAPF6) in acetonitrile was used to determine the
ionization potential (IP) of p(g4T2-TT), which remained unchanged
across the fractions at ~4.25 eV, providing an estimate for the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (Supplementary Fig. 13a)45. The
electron afﬁnity (EA) of p(C6g3NDI-T) also showed no signiﬁcant var-
iation at ~4.18 eV and provided an estimate for the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) (Supplementary Fig. 13b). Each polymer
exhibited partly reversible discrete reduction or oxidation behavior.
Due to the relatively narrow electrochemical stability window of the
electrolyte, the EA for p(g4T2-TT) and IP for p(C6g3NDI-T) could not be
accessed using this method.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers in solution and
as thin ﬁlms are presented in Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15,
respectively. p(g4T2-TT) showed a characteristic absorption proﬁle
as seen in previous reports of similar polymers46, where the λmax
(≈600 nm) is attributed to the π–π* transition (HOMO-LUMO tran-
sition), while the small lower energy band (≈950 nm) is most likely
attributed to ambient-induced polarons. As observed previously,
both bands for p(C6g3NDI-T) were blue-shifted to higher energy
compared to p(g4T2-TT), with the π–π* transition ≈345 nm and the
peak ≈600 nm attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) from the electron-rich bithiophene units to the electron-
deﬁcient NDI units24,47,48. In the UV-Vis absorbance spectra in solu-
tion of p(g4T2-TT) (Supplementary Fig. 14a), no band at ∼950 nm is
observed, conﬁrming its attribution to doping by ambient species in
the solid-state. The normalized UV-Vis data supported the uni-
formity noted by CV for each polymer series, providing almost
identical spectra across the molecular weights, which is unsurpris-
ing, given that no impact on the bandgap is expected above the
effective conjugation limit. The subtle differences observed in the
vibrionic structure for p(g4T2-TT) and the shift of the ICT band for
p(C6g3NDI-T) indicated that different packing may be induced by
the change in molecular weight (more clearly indicated in Supple-
mentary Information, Supplementary Fig. 16).
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was
employed to calculate the concentration of residual palladium con-
taminants in each fraction (Table 2), which originates from the Pd-
based catalysts required for Stille polymerizations. In both polymers,
the levels of palladium observed before preparative GPC fractionation
were on the same order of magnitude, at 1769 and 1176 ppm, for the
p-type and n-type polymers, respectively. For both OMIEC polymers,
this data demonstrated the impact of preparative GPC fractionation on
purity, whereby all fractions contained less Pd than the unpuriﬁed
fractions, with a decrease of between 54 and 97% in Pd levels observed.
This translated to Pd levels as low as 39 and 73 ppm, validating pre-
parative GPC as a consistent method for puriﬁcation.
To investigate the impact of fractionation (reduced dispersity
and reduced concentration of Pd) on the polymer microstructure,
grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measure-
ments were carried out. The line-cuts of the as-spun thin ﬁlms are
displayed in Fig. 2 and the 2D GIWAXS patterns and peak parameters
are included in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary
Figs. 17 and 18). p(g4T2-TT) compared well to previously reported
glycolated polythiophene derivatives28,43, presenting an edge-on
orientation. To quantitatively interpret the GIWAXS data, pseudo-
Voigt peak ﬁts were used to extract disorder associated coherence
lengths in the backbone and lamellar directions. The unpuriﬁed
p-type polymer had a poorly resolved π-stack compared to the four
fractions, which may be because of the larger Ð (Table 1). Notably,
after fractionation, the in-plane π-stack contracted by 0.05–0.09 Å
and displayed longer coherence lengths (narrower diffraction peaks)
in the backbone direction compared to the unpuriﬁed polymer
(Supplementary Fig. 17). p(g4T2-TT) showed evidence of two orders
of out-of-plane lamellar scattering, with the fractions showing
expanded lamellar spacing and a reduction in the coherence length
in the lamellar direction of 10–25%.
Contrastingly, p(C6g3NDI-T) showed a face-on orientation, in
agreement with previously reported NDI polymers19,49. The (010) out-
of-plane π-stack scattering displayed broad and relatively weak peaks
due to scattering arising from a small number of chains stacked
together, which can usually be attributed to a high degree of

paracrystalline disorder50. A trend in π-π stacking distance was
observed, with a small expansion in the out-of-plane d-spacing with
increasing Mn. This also corresponds to the bathochromic shift
observed in the ICT band in the UV-Vis absorption spectra with
decreasing molecular weight, indicating subtle differences in packing
(Supplementary Fig. 16b). Previous results have shown that for NDI-T2
backbones, two different packing conﬁgurations are possible, namely
Form I and Form II51. Form I occurs where the NDI motif aligns with an
NDI from a neighboring chain through cofacial registration, resulting
in double the backbone periodicity, whilst in a Form II conﬁguration
the NDI unit aligns with a bithiophene unit51. For p(C6g3NDI-T), the
(001) in-plane backbone spacing of 19.6–20.0 Å was consistent with
the length of an NDI-T repeat length, thus it can be assumed that
predominantly Form I stacking was present.
The electrochemical activity of both series of polymers was fur-
ther investigated in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous electrolyte through CV and
spectroelectrochemical measurements. Aqueous CV (Supplementary
Fig. 19) indicated that both polymers at all molecular weights were
reversibly doped and de-doped. All fractions of p(g4T2-TT) showed
comparable oxidation onset potentials of ≈−0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl. The
same is true for p(C6g3NDI-T), where similar reduction onsets of
≈−0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl were recorded. Their doping mechanisms were
further explored by spectroelectrochemical measurements, con-
ducted in the same electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 2a and Sup-
plementary Figs. 20a and 21a, all fractions of p(g4T2-TT) were partially
doped under ambient conditions and require a negative potential to
fully de-dope the ﬁlms, as indicated by the negative oxidation onset
potential. Progressive charging to +0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl showed a
gradual bleaching of the π-π* peak, with a simultaneous appearance of
a new absorption peak at ≈950 nm, which was attributed to the for-
mation
of
the
polymer’s
polaron,
as
described
in
previous
literature28,52. Beyond +0.3 V, this peak began to decrease in intensity
and a new peak at higher wavelengths appeared, which is ascribed to
the formation of bipolaronic species. Finally, the applied voltage was
returned to the initial value of −0.2 V and all fractions of the polymer
resumed their original de-doped UV-Vis absorption spectra, indicating

by charging at −0.8 V, the ICT band intensity decreases, while two new
absorption features appear at ≈480 nm and ≈790 nm. They are
assigned to transitions to the S1 and S2 states, which are dominated by
π-π* and ICT, as suggested by literature47. Notably, all fractions dis-
played a large doping extent, which was reversible, as shown by a
return to the fully de-doped polymer UV-Vis absorption spectrum
when charging is returned to the initial value. From the consistent UV,
CV and spectroelectrochemical data across all fractions of the two
polymers, it was concluded that the degree of doping remains con-
stant, and not dependent on the molecular weight or the degree of
purity in both cases.
Organic electrochemical transistor performance
OECT devices were fabricated and the electrical performance mea-
sured for each fraction, in order to elucidate the impact of the palla-
dium. The devices were fabricated according to the procedure
described in the Methods section, with a device geometry of
W = 100 µm and L = 10 µm. All devices were operated in accumulation
mode, and data was obtained without any post-processing treatments
(see Supplementary Figs. 22–25 for output, transfer and transcon-
ductance curves) and Table 2 summarizes the OECT parameters.
The impact of Pd impurities on the OECT performance was
ﬁrstly evaluated by comparing the Pd concentrations in each frac-
tion, measured by ICP-MS, to the charge carrier mobilities (Table 2).
Across F1-4 of both materials, where Pd concentrations are reduced,
the charge carrier mobility is increased in seven out of eight cases
(Table 2). We propose that the origins of these observations arise
from the Pd(0) nanoclusters, formed from the molecular Pd cross-
coupling catalyst during the polymerization reactions40,53,54. Such
species may be able to act as catalysts for ORR due to the favorable
energetic offsets55. For example, the LUMO of p(C6g3NDI-T) has an
energy of approximately −4.18 eV, considerably higher than the −5.1
to −5.2 eV work function of Pd56,57, meaning that both the electron
transfer from the polymer electron polaron to Pd and the ORR itself
are energetically favorable, leading to polaron annihilation. This
mechanism of charge transfer explains why the n-type polymer
observes a signiﬁcant increase in mobility upon the removal of Pd.
When mobile electrons are transferred to the Pd(0) nanoclusters to
catalyze the ORR, the electron mobility is reduced. It should be
noted that this reaction is only possible in aqueous conditions, such
as those used in OECT operation. Additionally, ORR can also gen-
erate hydrogen peroxide, which is biologically toxic, hindering any
application as a safe bioelectronic sensor58. Interestingly the
mobility of the p-type material was observed to be negatively
affected by higher palladium levels, albeit by a smaller factor than
the n-type (twofold decrease compared to ﬁvefold). There are no
accessible oxidation reactions in this case that could be driven by
the hole polaron energies. Impedance measurements on p-type
polymers with similar energy levels to p(g4T2-TT) have previously
indicated that increased Pd content can cause increased electrical
resistance41. It is possible that the presence of Pd nanoclusters in the
OECT polymer thin ﬁlms creates local distortions in the semi-
conductor microstructure, and a subsequent increase in energetic
disorder, leading to a reduction in mobility observed40,41,59.
In addition to containing differing concentrations of palladium,
each sample however also differed in both molecular weight and dis-
persity. To decouple the inﬂuence of these parameters on the OECT
charge carrier mobilities, all GPC fractions for each polymer were
recombined and the OECT characteristics were measured (see
recombined rows in Table 2, Fig. 4c, d, and Supplementary Figs. 26 and
27). In this way, any effects arising from the molecular weight varia-
tions or reduced dispersities of the fractionated batches are elimi-
nated. Furthermore, the physical form of Pd is representative of that
present in the unpuriﬁed polymers (i.e., nanoclusters vs molecular Pd).
The impact of puriﬁcation appears to offer a greater improvement for
p(C6g3NDI-T) than p(g4T2-TT). More speciﬁcally, there is a 92%
increase in electron mobility from 1.02 × 10−3 to 1.96 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1
for p(C6g3NDI-T), compared to ~50% increase in hole mobility for
p(g4T2-TT), from 3.13 to 4.75 cm2 V−1 s−1, where both have comparable
levels of Pd, at around 200 ppm. The recombined batches of both
polymers show comparable C* values to the unpuriﬁed batches,
resulting in increases to μC* from 0.227 to 0.503 F V−1 cm−1 s−1 for

p(C6g3NDI-T) and from 374 to 451 F V−1 cm−1 s−1 for p(g4T2-TT). Notably
the recombined batches of both polymers show a lower performance
than most of the fractions. This can be explained by the GIWAXS data
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18), where fractionation resul-
ted in both a decrease in π-π stacking distance and an increase in
coherence length, both of which would be expected to result in an
increase in charge carrier mobility.
To further explore the causal relationship between the con-
centration of Pd and the OECT performance, we reintroduced 2000
ppm of Pd back into the highest performing fraction, in the form of the
Pd2(dba)3 catalyst. The OECT characteristics were remeasured (Fig. 4a,
b). For fraction 3 of p(g4T2-TT), this resulted in lower performance,
with hole mobility decreasing from 6.53 to 3.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 28). For fraction 2 of p(C6g3NDI-T), the reintro-
duction of Pd also resulted in the mobility decreasing from 5.34 × 10−3
to 1.10 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 29). The p-type
polymer observed a smaller decrease than the n-type polymer, which is
consistent with the relative differences observed between the unpur-
iﬁed and remixed sample measurements.
Ionic impurities in thienothiophene-based polymers have pre-
viously been shown to also have little impacton charge carrier mobility
in OFET devices60. To explore this correlation in our polymers, the
unpuriﬁed and highest OECT performance fraction of each polymer
were tested in a top gate/bottom contact OTFT and compared, (the
output and transfer characteristics for which can found in Supple-
mentary Figs. 30 and 31). The n-type polymer, p(C6g3NDI-T), displayed
low output currents, which resulted in poor electron mobilities of
1.7 × 10−4 and 6.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the unpuriﬁed and fraction 2,
respectively. Interestingly, the unpuriﬁed batch exhibits an order of
magnitude greater electron mobility than the fractionated batch,
supporting previous observations that material purity has little impact
on OTFT performance. Instead, it is possible that the higher molecular
weights present in the unpuriﬁed batch led to more favorable mor-
phology, which is a dominant effect for OTFT performance. The hole
transporting polymer, p(g4T2-TT), displayed conducting properties
with no current modulation, so no mobility was able to be extracted.
For the p(g4T2-TT) series, the thickness normalized transcon-
ductance increased to a peak of 1457 S cm−1 for fraction 3 (con-
centration of Pd = 157 ppm), then decreased as the Mn further
increases. A similar trend is observed for p(C6g3NDI-T), where the
highest normalized transconductance was observed for fraction 2
(concentration of Pd = 39 ppm), at 0.155 S cm−1. Interestingly, for
both series, all values of the fractions were larger than that of the
unfractionated batch, which is likely to be caused by the increased
charge carrier mobility. [μC*] was calculated using Eq. (1), where the
same trends were observed, with the p-type increasing from 694 to
1308 to 2008 F V−1 cm−1 s−1, a very high OECT performance23,28,61,62,
then decreasing to 972 F V−1 cm−1 s−1 (Fig. 5a). p(C6g3NDI-T) also
mimicked the thickness normalized transconductance, with fraction
2 (the lowest concentration of Pd, at 39 ppm) providing the maximal
[μC*] value at a polymer-best 1.632 F V−1 cm−1 s−1 (Fig. 5b).
These trends were further probed by performing electro-
chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to determine the volu-
metric capacitance at offset potentials of 0 to −0.8 V and 0.3 to
0.8 V against Ag/AgCl, for p- and n-type devices, respectively, with a
0.1 M NaCl(aq) electrolyte (see Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33). For
p(g4T2-TT), C* increased from 114 F cm−3 to reach a peak for fraction
3 of 308 F cm−3, before decreasing by ~60%. A similar observation
was made for p(C6g3T2-T), where again fraction 3 provides the
optimal C* of 521 F cm−3. Both trends were supported by the doping
efﬁciency seen by spectroelectrochemical measurements, whereby
the π-π* transition in each case was normalized to one and the peak
associated with the polaron was plotted against each voltage
(Supplementary Fig. 21).
It is expected that this trend is observed due to the microstructure
of fraction 3 providing the optimal arrangement to promote ionic
miscibility3. As it is known that the microstructure is inﬂuenced by the
molecular weight31,33, and it is therefore suggested that the molecular
weight of fraction 3 is optimal for a high C* value. As documented in
literature, a high C* value may indicate that whilst a polymer is able to
accommodate compensatory ions, this results in a disruption to the
microstructure, leading to a decreased mobility28,63. This can be par-
tially observed for both polymer series, for example, fraction 3 of
p(C6g3NDI-T) had the highest C* value, but the lowest μOECT despite
lower concentration of electron trapping Pd. This demonstrates that a
ﬁne balance between μOECT and C* is required to maximize OMIEC
performance in OECTs, which can evidently be inﬂuenced by polymer
molecular weight. Whilst molecular weight may to some extent impact
OECT performance (evaluated by gm and [μC*]), both polymer series
indicate that the palladium concentration has more inﬂuence.
Another critical aspect of OECT performance is the operational
stability of devices. Device stability was measured by cycling the gate
potential and recording the drain current over 30 min. Generally, it was
observed that the stability of the polymer was improved when the Pd
content was reduced, with the fractionated materials exhibiting better
stability than the unpuriﬁed batches (Supplementary Figs. 34 and 35).
Numerically, this translates to a change in drain current of 7% for one
of the puriﬁed fractions of p(C6g3NDI-T), compared to a 36% change
for the unpuriﬁed batch (Fig. 6). Similarly, the stability of the p-type
polymer improved from a 66% change in drain current for the
unpuriﬁed batch, to a change of 28% for fraction 2 (Fig. 6). This gen-
erates hydrogen peroxide in a two-electron process, which is likely
detrimental to OECT performance and can cause degradation of both
the OMIEC and the electrodes58,64. This therefore indicates that the
purity of the polymer plays a role in determining both OECT perfor-
mance and stability.

To summarize, this study explores the inﬂuence of polymer purity
and molecular weight on the two most common polymer backbones
for OECT applications, a p-type polythiophene and an n-type NDI
material. These materials employed preparative GPC as a puriﬁcation
technique for polymers, fractionating a single polymer batch into four
batches. By studying the optoelectronic properties using UV-Vis
absorption, CV and spectroelectrochemical measurements, the struc-
tural properties using GIWAXS and the OECT characteristics, the
impact of OMIEC purity on the OECT performance of polymers p(g4T2-
TT) and p(C6g3NDI-T) was examined.
To better understand the trend in performance observed across a
range of palladium concentrations, particularly the charge carrier
mobility, OECT devices were fabricated and measured. We found that
the reduced palladium signiﬁcantly improved the OECT performance,
arising mainly from an increase in mobility (of ~60% and 80% for the p-
and n-type, respectively), when comparing the unpuriﬁed fractions
with the puriﬁed fractions. We hypothesize that residual Pd arranges in
nanoclusters, which act to trap charges and as a co-catalyst for ORR,
reducing OMIEC stability. These ﬁndings were further veriﬁed by
reintroducing 2,000 ppm of Pd into the highest performing fraction of
each polymer, which saw signiﬁcant decreases in the OECT mobilities.
These observations highlight the importance of synthetic pur-
iﬁcation of any semiconducting polymer to be employed in an ambi-
ent, aqueous environment. For a valid comparison between OMIECs
and to derive accurate structure-property relationships, this work
indicates that Pd levels must be as low as possible. As this observation
applies to both p- and n-type materials, proper puriﬁcation of new and
existing OMIECs will enhance understanding of OMIECs and improve
OECT performance, and preparative GPC offers a versatile method to
achieve this.
Methods
Materials’ characterization
Column chromatography was performed on silica gel from VWR Sci-
entiﬁc, using the indicated solvents. Thin layer chromatography was
performed on Silicagel 60 F254 plates purchased from Merck. 1H and
13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer at
298 K, with chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per million (ppm)
downﬁeld from tetramethylsilane (TMS). Deuterated solvents were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Electrospray (ES-ToF) mass spectro-
metry was performed using a Micromass LCT Premier. Recycling pre-
parative HPLC was performed using a LaboACE LC-5060 instrument
with a separation line containing a 4HH column. The polymers were
injected as 5 mg mL−1 solutions in chloroform and collected at intervals
such that each fraction was approximately one quarter of the material
injected, then the solvent removed in vacuo. For OECT characteristics
where palladium was reintroduced to the best performing fractions,
2,000 ppm of Pd2(dba)3 was dissolved in 5 mg mL−1 solution of the
polymer in chloroform. For OECT characteristics where fractions 1–4
were recombined, this was done so in a mass ratio of 1:1.4:1.4:1 for
F1:F2:F3:F4 in order to replicate the original molecular weight proﬁle,
and solutions of 5 mg mL−1 were used for spin coating the devices. For
measurements requiring thin ﬁlms (UV-vis absorption, spectro-
electrochemical measurements, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray
scattering, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and transistor
properties), these were formed by spin coating 50 µL of 5 mg mL−1
polymer solutions onto cleaned glass, silicon wafers, ITO or transistor
substrates and allowed to air dry. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray
scattering (GIWAXS) was conducted at the Advanced Photon Source
(APS) at Argonne National Laboratory using an incident beam energy
of 10.92 keV and an incident angle of 0.14°. Raw scattering data were
processed using GIXSGUI65 and analyzed using a custom MATLAB
script. For inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
measurements, element concentrations were determined based on
dry polymer weight. Samples were digested in TraceMetal® grade
concentrated nitric acid under elevated temperature (200 °C) and
pressure in ﬂuoropolymer pressure vessels in a CEM MARS5 micro-
wave digestion system. Digested samples were diluted with 2% v/v
nitric acid prior to analysis to target an estimated 1–100 µg/L in the
analytical solution. Analysis was performed on an Agilent 8900 ICP-MS
attached to an Agilent SPS-4 autosampler. The sample introduction
system also includes a standard Scott double pass cooled spray
chamber operated at 2 °C, a 2.5 mm i.d. Agilent glass torch, and a
200 µL/min Micromist nebulizer. The ICP-MS was ﬁtted with standard

nickel cones and operated in no gas mode. Beforeanalysis, allsolutions
were further diluted by 50% by teeing in an internal standard solution
of 2 µg/L platinum and rhodium (High Purity Standards) prepared with
2% v/v nitric acid to correct for instrumental drift. Procedural blanks
were run in parallel with samples and averaged 14 ng contributing to
less than 2% of the analytical signal and are regarded as negligible.
Reproducibility is estimated to be 2.8% RSD from repeated analyses
(n = 11) over 2 analytical sessions of an in-house QC sample prepared
from a polymer of know Pd composition.
Electrochemical characterization
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on UV-1601 (λmax 1100 nm)
UV-VIS Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrometers. Solution UV-Vis absorption
spectroscopy was conducted on chloroform solutions with a polymer
concentration of 0.006 mg mL−1. UV-Vis absorption spectra were also
recorded for thin ﬁlms of the polymers on glass substrates. Cyclic
voltammetry was performed employing an Autolab PGSTAT101 with a
standard three-electrode conﬁguration, including polymer-coated
glassy carbon rod as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the
counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl wire electrode as the reference
electrode. The polymer was drop cast onto the glassy carbon electrode
from 5 mg mL−1 solutions and allowed to air dry before each mea-
surement. The supporting electrolyte employed was a 0.1 М tetra-
butylammonium hexaﬂuorophosphate in acetonitrile solution or 0.1 M
aqueous NaCl solution and was degassed for 30 min before use. The
scan rate was 0.1 V s−1 and the second and third scans are displayed in
each ﬁgure herein. Spectroelectrochemical measurements were
obtained from thin ﬁlms of the polymer on ITO glass slides with the
corresponding semiconductor. This was then connected in the same
three-electrode conﬁguration as for the cyclic voltammetry experi-
ment and placed within a cuvette holder. The resulting electro-
chemical setup was then conﬁgured to reside inside the UV-1800
Shimadzu UV-Vis spectrometer previously employed for determining
the optical properties of the polymers.
Transistor fabrication and characterization
OECT substrates were fabricated following previously reported pho-
tolithographic techniques46. The OECT devices featured gold contacts
making up a channel with width = 100 µm and length = 10 µm. To
mitigate the problems with the parylene lift-off with p-type polymers,
the substrates underwent a pre-deposition surface treatment to pro-
mote adhesion of the polymer ﬁlm to the channels and electrodes66.
The polymer solutions (5 mg mL−1) were deposited by spin-coating at
1000 rpm and 500 rpm for the p- and n-type polymers, respectively,
for 45 s before air drying and peeling off the sacriﬁcial parylene layer.
Transistor properties were measured using an aqueous 0.1 М NaCl
solution as the supporting electrolyte and an Ag/AgCl pellet electrode
as the gate electrode and presented data is an average across 6 devices.
Output and transfer characteristics, as well as stability measurements
were recorded by connecting OECTs to an IviumStat potentiostat. Data
was recorded through custom built LabVIEW software. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy was performed using the same potentiostat,
employing 600 µm × 600 µm polymer coated gold electrodes as the
working electrode, with an Ag/AgCl pellet electrode as the gate elec-
trode. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments a
frequency range between 100 kHz to 1 Hz and an AC amplitude of
10 mV over a DC voltage above the threshold for the polymer. All OFET
ﬁlms were prepared and characterized under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Borosilicate substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonication in a
dilute Extran 300 detergent solution and deionized water for 30 min
each. Then the substrates were cleaned with acetone and isopropyl
alcohol by ultrasonication for 10 min each. As source-drain electrodes,
35 nm of Au with 5 nm of Al as the sticking layer was thermally eva-
porated at 2 × 10−6 mbar. The substrates with patterned Au/Al
source–drain contacts were subjected to a UV-ozone treatment step
for 20 min. The channel width and length of the transistors were
1000 μm/40 μm. Before the ﬁlm deposition, the polymers were dis-
solved in anhydrous chloroform. The solutions were kept under stir-
ring on a hot plate at room temperature for overnight. As gate
dielectric, the mixture of Cytop (CTL-809M) and its solvent (CT-SOLV
180) with a volume ratio of 2:1 was spin-coated at 1200 rpm for 60 s.
The Cytop ﬁlm was then thermally annealed at 50 °C for 2 h before the
deposition of Al as a gate electrode. The electrical characteristics of the
OTFTs were monitored by a probe station placed in an N2-ﬁlled glove
box that is connected to an Agilent B1500A semiconductor parameter
analyzer. The saturation-regime mobility (μsat) of the transistor was
determined using the equation μsat = 2L=WCiðdId

, where Id is the
source–drain current, Ci is the capacitance per unit area, L is the
channel length, W is the channel width, and Vg is the gate voltage.
