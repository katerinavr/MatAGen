High performance stretchable organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors with highly stability are extremely 
demanding for flexible bioelectronics. However, very little is known about the correlation between the mixed 
conduction and both stability and mechanical deformability of n-type small molecular organic electrochemical 
transistors (OECTs). Herein, a stereoisomerism was reported as an effective platform to address these challenges 
by introducing a concept of coupling rigid tetrachloro perylene diimides (PDI) skeleton and amorphous thio­
nation stereoisomer to afford the stereoisomerism of dithionated oligo(ethylene glycol) functionalized PDI (2S- 
gPDI). In further, for the first time we carried out proof-of-concept experiments to build the correlations between 
both chemical/microstructures and the thin/thick films’ ambient stability as well as mechanical deformability 
based on this novel small-molecule mixed conductors. Our results reveal that the thionation stereoisomerism 
render 2S-gPDI higher figure of merit μC* and ambient stability as well as higher mechanical deformability 
owing to the lower LUMO levels, porous film morphology and lower degree of film crystallinity, when compared 
with the parent unthionated gPDI-based mixed conductors. It is envisioned that the coupling rigid skeleton and 
amorphous stereoisomer concept will guide the next generation of high stable small-molecules stretchable 
OECTs.   
1. Introduction 
The development and advancement of bioelectronics devices has 
great significance to human health [1]. As a particular kind of bio­
electronic prototype device, organic electrochemical transistors 
(OECTs) have attracted increased attention as effective diagnostics 
systems, electrophysiological monitoring, multi-functional logic circuit 
and neural computing owing to ultralow operating voltage below 1 V, 
excellent transconductance capability and high ion sensitivity [2–4]. 
While for considering further integration and real commercial applica­
tion, the mechanical deformations and stable mixed conduction are 
essential for reliable signal output and accurate diagnosis [5,6]. 
π-conjugated systems have been largely underwritten owing to their 
intrinsic flexible and stretchable characteristics in organic electronics 
[7]. The oligo ethylene glycol (OEG) functionalized π-conjugated 
systems can be mixed ionic–electronic conductors and acted as the 
active channel materials for OECTs to simultaneously transport ions and 
charges, which greatly determined the device performance and stability 
in OECTs. Since the first accumulation-model OECTs has been reported 
in 2016, rapid progress has been made for the mixed ionic-electronic 
polymeric conductors, leading the figures of merits µC* value up to 
2008 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for p-type mixed polymeric conductors, [8] 
whereas n-type counterpart is much lagged with μC* values around 50 F 
cm−1 V−1 s−1 [9]. This mismatch between p-type and n-type perfor­
mance largely hinders the development of low-power OECT-based 
complementary-like inverters for amplifying in biological signals (e.g., 
electrophysiological signal and enzymatic reaction signal). Thus, it is 
indispensable and imperative to develop high-performance n-type OECT 
materials for constructing high gain inverter. Moreover, compared with 
p-type OECTs, the n-type OECTs easily suffer from the electrical

performance decrease in ambient condition. The lowest unoccupied 
molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of n-type mixed ionic-electronic conductors 
(OMIEC) lower than −4.0 eV can protect the material against oxidation 
under ambient condition in the presence of both oxygen and moisture, 
the n-type OMIECs tend to be oxidized according to the following re­
action: [10] 
4OMIECs−+ O2 + 2H2O→4OMIECs + 4OH−
(1) 
The formation of OH−groups can trap the electron and then reduce 
the amount of mobile electron available. There are two aspects to be 
considered for channel materials for achieving high ambient stability n- 
type OECT: the thermodynamic stability of the charge carrier by 
lowering the LUMO energy levels and formation of the kinetic barrier 
[11–13]. In especial, forming the kinetic barrier with densely packed 
crystalline structures can keep the oxygen and moisture out of the active 
conducting layer [14–17]. 
In comparison with variety polymeric conductors, small-molecule 
conductors based OECTs have far fewer advances because lacking 
effective molecules strategy and the continuous film formation capa­
bility based small-molecule is great challenge [18]. However, small 
molecular semiconductors have obvious advantages since they are 
easier to synthesize and purify without batch effect, easily reproducing 
device performance [19–21]. Meanwhile, the ambient stability of n-type 
small molecular OECT is an extreme challenge, and the instability 
mechanisms are still lack of systematic study, although the small mo­
lecular mixed conductors are ideal candidates for the research model 
owing to its relatively simple and accurate structure to establish accu­
rate structure and stability relationship. Thus, effective synthetic stra­
tegies for enhancing the mixed conduction and ambient stability in 
small-molecules OECTs are extremely demanded. 
Apart from the electrical performance and ambient stability in 
OECTs, the mechanical property of the semiconductors is also a critical 
issue for flexible bioelectronics [22]. Generally amorphous segments are 
more easily deformed through semiconductors’ conformation change 
and chain reordering to allow strain energy-dissipation [23]. Some 
effective strategies by introducing cross-linkers, using terpolymers have 
been reported to retain the electrical properties under repeated strains in 
organic field effect transistors [24–26]. While no molecular design 
concept has addressed this challenge in stretchable OECTs. Even though 
some progress of stretchable OECTs based conjugated polymers has been 
made by optimizing device technology, for example, Huang et al. tuned 
film microstructure with creating uniform honeycomb porous structure 
with biaxially prestretched platform to achieve stable OECTs with a 
charge transport over 30–140 % tensional strain [27]. Regrettably, 
nearly all the active materials in stretchable OECTs are conjugated 
polymers, whereas the small molecules are habitually neglected because 
they are prone to keep a highly crystalline microstructure to facilitate 
charge mobility in organic thin film transistors, which is unfavorable for 
mechanical stretchability [28,29]. In the case of OECTs, the micro­
structure allow volumetric penetration of hydrated ions and water 
molecules will undergo extensive swelling, leading to disruption of the 
connected crystalline domains and the ordering in aqueous electrolytes, 
this might hinder the charge-carrier mobility [30]. While this may open 
a new approach to design stretchable small mixed conductors since 
achieving efficient ionic-electronic coupling no longer only rely on the 
high crystallinity. Thus, the key challenge is to have a molecular design 
concept to afford materials platform to address above issues and sys­
temically investigate the structure, mixed conduction, stability, and 
stretchability relationship. 
Perylene diimides (PDIs) are versatile n-type materials showing 
significant promise in a number of opto-electronic devices due to their 
high electron affinity and excellent photochemical and thermal stabil­
ities [31]. PDIs also featuring straightforward synthetic modification at 
the bay positions and imide nitrogen [32]. As a tentative exploration of 
OECT active materials, we have revealed that by tuning OEG side chain 
length, modifying the core, and extending π-conjugation of the 
glycolated PDI small molecules can be effective strategies to realize 
efficient mixed ionic-electronic conduction, [33,34] as shown in Fig. 1a. 
The oxygen–sulfur atomic substitution is an effective approach to tune 
the LUMO energy level, electron mobility and photophysical properties 
without significantly perturbing the overall molecular structure [35,36]. 
Inspired by our previous reports of promising PDIs derivatives for 
efficient n-type mixed conduction, we propose a new strategy for 
designing n-type mechanically deformable small molecular mixed ionic- 
electronic conductors. We replace the carbonyl oxygen with sulfur to 
maintain the overall backbone structure. Furthermore, the dithionation 
lead to stereoisomerism of PDIs to introduce lower degree crystallinity 
to form amorphous domains will potentially contribute to the ions 
penetration (volumetric capacity) and enhance mechanical deform­
ability. Since the amorphous segments are easily stretched, the strain 
energy can be easily released through the conformation changes and 
reordering of the microstructure. 
Herein, two carbonyl oxygens of the glycolated 4ClPDI (gPDI) are 
substituted by sulfur to achieve the dithionated PDIs (2S-gPDI) stereo­
isomerism, as shown in Fig. 1b. We systematically investigate how the 
thionation stereoisomerism affects the electronic, optical and molecular 
stacking properties as well as the electrical performance, ambient sta­
bility and mechanical deformability where gPDI as a reference. 2S-gPDI 
exhibits more efficient n-type mixed conduction and stronger ambient 
stability both in thin and thick film OECT devices, which attributed to its 
higher electron affinity, lower film crystallinity and lower loss of charge 
carrier density, as evidenced by cyclic voltammetry (CV), grazing inci­
dence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and charge accumulation 
spectroscopy (CAS). Specifically, 2S-gPDI not only affords a nearly three 
times higher μC* value of 0.8 F V−1 cm−1 s−1 but also shows an almost 
double higher μC* retention of 46 % after exposing 21 days in air. More 
importantly, 2S-gPDI show much higher film mechanical deformability 
than that of gPDI owing to the lower crystallinity originating from the 
stereoisomer effect, the 2S-gPDI still remain a decent higher μC* 
retention along the parallel and perpendicular strain directions (47 % 
for parallel and 60 % for perpendicular) than the reference molecule 
gPDI (30 % for parallel and 32 % for perpendicular) where a strain is 
applied up to 50 %. Our work demonstrates that the thionation stereo­
isomerism can be an attractive strategy to enhance the electrical per­
formance, ambient stability and mechanical deformability of OECTs. 
2. Results and discussion 
2.1. Synthesis and characterization 
The synthetic procedure for 2S-gPDI is outlined in Fig. 1b. Specif­
ically, the OEG side chains substituted phenylethyl with two spacers was 
attached at the imide position to ensure sufficient solubility and to 
realize efficient ionic-electronic conduction. Meanwhile, the subtly 
designed phenyl-alkyl side chain composed of a rigid phenyl group was 
considered to form a high-quality aggregated micro-structure and 
potentially enhance electron mobility [37]. The synthesis details have 
been described in the supporting information. Starting from 4-(2-ami­
noethyl)phenol, Boc protection was firstly performed, followed by 
nucleophilic substitution reaction and the removal of the Boc group 
under acidic conditions to afford the desired oligo (ethylene–glycol) 
(EG) chains substituted phenylethyl amine [38]. The nonthionated gPDI 
was used to as reference conductor throughout our study, which was 
afforded through one-pot imidation from commercially available 
1,6,7,12-tetrachloroperylene 
tetracarboxylic 
acid 
dianhydride 
(4ClPTCDA) with EG substituted phenylethylamine in hot propionic 
acid. When gPDI was treated by Lawesson’ s reagent, the oxygen–sulfur 
atomic substitution reaction occurs at the imide carboxyl positions to 
achieve the dithionated 2S-gPDI. Notably, only dithionated PDIs prod­
ucts can be separated by using conventional silica gel chromatography, 
which contains both cis and trans conformation with a ratio close to 1:1 
confirmed by the integral of the aromatic peak around 9.05 ppm of the

proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. This ste­
reoisomer with both cis and trans conformation might provide us an 
opportunity to afford relative amorphous domains, which sometimes is 
beneficial for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in OECTs as well as to 
help dissipate the strain energy [39]. In addition, the chemical struc­
tures of gPDI and the stereoisomer feature of 2S-gPDI were also well 
confirmed by carbon NMR and matrix-assisted laser desorption- 
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Both con­
ductors exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvent, indi­
cating excellent solvent processing ability for further device 
optimization. Both molecules exhibited good thermal stability with the 
5 % weight loss decomposition temperatures over 300 ◦C (Fig. S1a), 
which was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The dif­
ferential scanning calorimeter (DSC) results revealed that both mole­
cules displayed only one endothermic/exothermic peak during the 
heating/cooling process (Fig. S1b and Table S1). The melting/crystal­
lization temperatures (Tm/Tc) were 207 ◦C/216 ◦C for gPDI and 246 ◦C/ 
237 ◦C for 2S-gPDI, respectively. 
2.2. Photophysical and electrochemical properties 
The photophysical characteristics of two conductors were investi­
gated using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy in dilute solution and thin 
film states, the corresponding spectra were depicted in Fig. 2a and data 
has been summarized at Table 1. In solution states, gPDI showed the 
maximum absorption (λmax) at 519 nm with a molar absorption coeffi­
cient (ε) of 4.60 × 104 M−1 cm−1, in contrast, 2S-gPDI exhibited larger 
red-shifted absorption by 72 nm with λmax at 591 nm and a lower ε of 
4.12 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Although both solution and film absorption 
profiles exhibited three vibrational peaks between 400 and 720 nm, 
corresponding to the 0–2, 0–1 and 0–0 electronic transitions. A 
pronounced change both in absorption profile and the maximum peak 
was observed from solution to films. In each case, both film spectra 
showed a distinctly bathochromic shift compared with their solution 
spectra, indicating the formation of stronger intermolecular interactions 
in the thin film [40]. Interestingly, the 0–0 vibrational peak of 2S-gPDI 
was stronger in solution while the intensity of 0–1 vibrational peak 
became stronger in solid state. This distinct change in thin film largely 
attributed to forming an H-like aggregation induced by regiochemical 
thionation [41]. Moreover, the film absorption onsets increased from 
553 nm for gPDI to 639 nm for 2S-gPDI, resulting in a narrowing of the 
optical bandgap (Eg
opt) from 2.24 eV to 1.94 eV. 
Subsequently, the electrochemical properties were evaluated by cy­
clic voltammetry (CV) in both organic and aqueous media. As depicted 
in Fig. S2a, both molecules presented apparent reduction peaks in a 
deoxygenated dichloromethane solution containing 0.1 M tetrabuty­
lammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6), indicative of their n- 
type characteristic. Using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple 
as the external reference, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
(LUMO) energy levels were estimated from the first onset of reduction. 
The LUMO/highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels 
(ELUMO/EHOMO) were calculated to be −4.08/-6.32 eV for gPDI and 
−4.28/-6.22 eV for 2S-gPDI, respectively (see Fig. 2b and Table 1). 
Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicated that dithio­
nation lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy 
of the PDI core, which is consistent with the literature (see Fig. S2b and 
c). As expected, the thionated molecule 2S-gPDI showed deeper LUMO 
energy level than gPDI, which could promote electron injection and 
potentially enhance stability in aqueous environment. To simulate OECT 
relevant conditions, continuous CV measurements of thin film in 0.1 M 
NaCl aqueous solution at a scan rate of 100 mV/s were also conducted 
(Fig. S2d and e). Both molecules had a stable electrochemical reduction

in aqueous media which largely benefited OECT device stability. Their 
CV curves appeared a highly reversibility and remained near unchanged 
over 50 cycles when scanned between 0.4 and −0.4 V against Ag/AgCl 
reference. Furthermore, a noticeable phenomenon was that the 2S-gPDI 
arisen a more positive reduction onset than gPDI due to the deeper 
LUMO energy level induced by thionation. 
In conjunction with the aqueous CV experiment, the electrochromic 
behaviors of both molecules were also explored by means of spec­
troelectrochemistry that was recorded at a potential interval of −0.1 V. 
Since both molecules were n-type mixed conductors, they were charged 
by reduction. Steadily driven by the negative voltages, sodium ions in 
the electrolyte penetrated into thin film to keep the charge neutrality. 
With increasing the reduction potential, both molecules demonstrated 
gradually bleaching of the neutral absorption bands (around 491 and 
558 nm, respectively) with concurrent progressive generation of a pos­
itive polaron absorption band (around 761 and 867 nm, respectively) as 
shown in Fig. S3 and Fig. 2c,d. A quantitative way to gauge the changes 
comparatively was shown in Fig. 2e, where the generated polaron 
intensity was plotted versus the applied voltage. The 2S-gPDI exhibited a 
lower onset potential than the gPDI during the polaron formation, which 
was in good agreement with the CV results discussed above. When 
comparing the curve slopes, the 2S-gPDI exhibited a higher slope than 
the gPDI suggesting its faster reduction. Such more pronounced reduc­
tion was attributed to its deeper LUMO level and the stronger ion-uptake 
ability as evidenced by the EIS results, vide infra. 
2.3. Microstructure and morphology analysis 
Having fully characterized the electrochemical properties, the two- 
dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D- 
GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies were performed to 
understand how the regiochemistry-manipulated thionation impact the 
film microstructure and morphology, and their corresponding results 
were given in Fig. 3. The GIWAXS scattering patterns of both molecules 
presented conjugated-polymer-like diffractions (Fig. 3a,b) in which 
gPDI exhibited a mixed face-on and edge-on molecular packing

orientation, while 2S-gPDI adopts a face-on molecular packing orien­
tation. Their corresponding line profiles of the diffraction patterns out- 
of-plane and in-plane were plotted in Fig. 3c,d with the packing pa­
rameters summarized in Table S2. Firstly, a decrease in the intensity of 
both out-of-plane and in-plane diffraction peaks was observed from the 
gPDI film to the 2S-gPDI film, especially in the high-q region. Moreover, 
the π-π stacking distance increase from 3.88 Å (face-on orientation) and 
3.49 Å (edge-on orientation) for gPDI to 3.90 Å (face-on orientation) for 
2S-gPDI. Then, the coherence lengths (Lc) for lamellar packing and 
π-stacking along the out-of-plane/in-plane direction were further 
calculated according to Scherrer equation. The gPDI film showed almost 
identical coherence length of 188.40 Å with 2S-gPDI for the lamellar 
packing in out-of-plane direction, nevertheless, the coherence length at 
the π-π stacking in out-of-plane direction of gPDI (25.69 Å) is larger than 
that of 2S-gPDI (23.55 Å). In-plane direction, the gPDI film gave a larger 
coherence length (62.80 Å) at the lamellar packing than 2S-gPDI (56.52 
Å). These results indicated that regiochemical thionation gave rise to a 
lower overall crystallinity in thin film. Apart from the microstructure 
analysis, the surface morphology was studied by using the AFM mea­
surement. Both molecule films showed a continuous and uniform 
morphology (Fig. 3e,f). The difference was that the gPDI films exhibited 
the densely surface morphology while the 2S-gPDI films appeared 
porous surface morphology. This phenomenon may caused by different 
intermolecular interaction of two molecules during film formation [42]. 
In addition, phase separation may also the origin of porous morphol­
ogies since thionated 2S-gPDI contains two stereoisomers. Generally, the 
interfacial porous films delivered more efficient ion exchange and faster 
doping than the corresponding dense films. Moreover, the surface 
morphology of the films’ upper layer, as a kinetic barrier, also affected 
the devices’ ambient stability [43]. Apparently, the oxygen easily 
invaded into the inner of the semiconducting film through the porous 
surface rather than dense surface. This was implied that the 2S-gPDI film 
was seemingly more easily to be oxidized than the gPDI film, especially 
in early stage [44,45]. Furthermore, the uniformly porous morphology 
had been proved to improve the thin-film electrical property under the 
strain. It was mean that the porous 2S-gPDI film may be possessed 
potentially high mechanical deformability relative to the dense gPDI 
film. 
2.4. Film electrical performance characteristics 
The effect of regiochemically manipulating the thiocarbonyl groups 
on the resultant mixed conduction properties was explored by fabri­
cating OECT devices employing both molecules as the active channel 
material. Each device with an identical channel dimension (39000 μm 
width × 20 μm length) was operated in a 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution 
incorporating an Ag/AgCl gate electrode. Corroborating the electro­
chemical and spectroelectrochemical studies in aqueous electrolyte, 
both molecules displayed an enhancement-mode n-type operation in 
their output and transfer curves as evidenced in Fig. 4a-d, and their 
performance parameters were listed in Table 2. The gPDI performed a 
relatively lower device performance with a maximum channel current of 
43 μA and a normalized transconductance value of 0.06 S cm−1. In 
contrast, the 2S-gPDI showed both higher current response (around 250 
μA) and normalized transconductance (around 0.15 S cm−1). In agree­
ment with its deeper LUMO level and lower reduction onset, the 2S- 
gPDI-based devices operated in a lower threshold voltage at 0.05 V 
than gPDI at 0.20 V. As for transient response (Fig. S4), the 2S-gPDI gave 
a faster on/off time constant (τon,90%/τoff,90%) of 122/36 ms compared to 
322/78 ms for gPDI, which likely benefited from the decrease of thin 
film crystallinity ensuring handily ions doping/dedoping. In addition, 
the on-to-off current ratio of both molecules was found in the similar 
order of magnitude (~103). 
The mobility-capacitance product (μC*), a material-dependent fac­
tor, represented a more universally comparable material figure of merit 
for OECT. The corresponding μC* value extracted from geometry- 
dependent transconductance plot, as shown in Fig. 4e. The result 
revealed that the μC* increased more than double going from 0.3 F V−1 
cm−1 s−1 for gPDI to 0.8 F V−1 cm−1 s−1 for 2S-gPDI. Note that the μC* 
(0.8 F V−1 cm−1 s−1) for 2S-gPDI was the highest value reported to date 
for PDI-based small molecular OECTs. Further investigating the source 
of higher μC*, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)

technique was used to acquire the film volumetric capacitance and 
presented in the Fig. S5 and Fig. 4f. The 2S-gPDI film exhibited a larger 
volumetric capacitance (303 F cm−3) than the gPDI film (250 F cm−3), 
implying that the thin film held a better ionic miscibility and transport to 
potentially augment electrical performance. Additionally, their electron 
mobility (μe) was determined by calculating from the μC* and C* values. 
Unexpectedly, a higher electron mobility could be extracted for 2S-gPDI 
(2.6 × 10-3 cm2 V−1 s−1) relative to the gPDI (1.2 × 10-3 cm2 V−1 s−1), 
although the gPDI film evinced a stronger crystallinity. We supposed 
that the highly crystalline film prevented ions from electrolyte rapidly 
penetrated into bulk film and then decreased the ionic-to-electronic 
coupling efficiency within the entire volume of the film in the chan­
nel, finally resulting in a low electron mobility [46]. Therefore, the 
thionation was beneficial to simultaneously improve the volumetric 
capacitance and the electron mobility, which acted as a feasible strategy 
to enhance the electrical performance of n-type small molecules. 
2.5. Film ambient stability study 
The device stability was conspicuously one of the key factors for 
practical bioelectronic applications. Conceivably, the OECT-based de­
vices with high stability will be instrumental in reliable physiological 
signal processing and avoiding complex encapsulation to cut cost. We 
also investigated the influence of thionation of perylenediimides-based 
molecule on device stability because it brought the deeper LUMO en­
ergy level. The systematic device stability investigations were performed 
under three representative stress conditions: i) repeated square gate 
pulse switching, ii) consecutive transfer curve sweeping, and iii) long- 
term aging. OECTs with a similar thin film thickness (~45 nm) were 
prepared for gPDI and 2S-gPDI for a better comparison. In addition, all 
of devices operated in 0.1 M NaCl aqueous electrolyte and at a constant 
channel voltage (VDS) of 0.4 V. Firstly, the OECTs based on both mole­
cules were switched off- and on-state over 600 de-doping/doping cycles 
by applying a periodically gate voltage of 0 to 0.4 V. By monitoring the 
off- and on-state channel current (Fig. S6a), both devices exhibited a 
negligible current change during the entire period, which was consistent 
with the CV measurement. As a stress test under the condition of 
consecutive transfer curve sweeping, the steady-state channel current 
and the associated transconductance were concurrently collected under 
continuous cycling, further evaluating their short-term operation sta­
bility. As proved in Fig. S6b and c, the channel current and the trans­
conductance for both molecules based OECT were not substantially 
changed even after one hundred consecutive sweeping. Therefore, these 
observations sufficiently revealed that both molecules exhibited a high

operational stability and reversibility in their electrochemical window 
during the short-term operation. Note that the device’s gate voltage 
range was determined from −0.05 V to 0.4 V, since all devices’ transfer 
cycle stabilities were slightly decreased with higher gate voltage (see 
Fig. S7). 
In view of the excellent short-term stability, the long-term aging for 
both molecules were investigated. Likewise, the aging measurements 
were conducted by exposing all the devices in air for a designated 
period, followed by charactering their transfer curves using 0.1 M NaCl 
aqueous electrolyte at a particular moment. As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, 
b, the gPDI-based device was sharply reduced down to a quarter of the 
initial on-current after 21-day exposure, whereas the 2S-gPDI-based 
device still remained more than half of the initial on-current after the 
same-period. In the case of the transconductance change, both devices 
gave a similar behavior concurred with their channel current downtrend 
(see Fig. S8), i.e., the maximum transconductance near 0.4 V for the 
gPDI rapidly fell from ~ 0.4 mS (0 day) to ~0.1 mS (21 day), while the 
maximum transconductance near 0.3 V for the 2S-gPDI slowly decreased 
from ~0.8 mS (0 day) to ~0.4 mS (21 day). To better exclude the dif­
ference between devices, the μC* retention was adopted to judge the 
strength of the ambient stability for both molecules (see Fig. 5c). After 
21-day aging, the gPDI-based device only retained a quite low μC* 
retention of 22 %. In contrast, the μC* of 2S-gPDI-based device kept a 
relatively high level up to 46 % even after 21-day aging. We suspect that 
the apparent difference of device ambient stability could originate from 
the different LUMO energy level as previously discussion, i.e., the 
thionation lowered the LUMO energy level to enhance the ambient 
stability. The deeper LUMO level of mixed conductors prevented fast 
formation of OH−
group, avoiding excessive loss of the electrons. 
Remarkably, the ambient stability was enhanced for both devices with 
thickening film (see Fig. S9 and Fig. 5d). More specifically, the thick 
active layer enabled the better ambient stability after exposure to air for 
21 days, in which the μC* retention was increased significantly from 22 
% (thin-film) to 57 % (thick-film) for gPDI and from 46 % (thin-film) to 
72 % (thick-film) for 2S-gPDI, respectively. To further confirm the 
impact of film thickness on air stability, the third “thickest” devices with 
film thickness of around 600 nm were fabricated and the related per­
formance parameters were tested under the same ambient condition (see 
Fig. S10). As seen, two molecular “thickest” devices both presented 
stronger air stability than their thin films. Specifically, the μC* retention 
of gPDI further increased to 63 % while that of 2S-gPDI raised to 78 % 
after exposing in air at 21 days. This enhancement effect was largely 
attributed to the upper layer of the thick film as a kinetic barrier, which 
partly prevented the oxygen from rapidly penetrating into inner film 
[47,48]. Further, SEM was carried out to invesigate the surface 
morphology of the thick and thin film, the porous density of the thick 
film based 2S-gPDI significantly decreases with a relatively dense 
morphology (see Fig. S11). Meanwhile it seems the porous structures 
only exist at the film surface. Therefore, the thick films can effectively 
slow down oxygen infiltration with higher air stability under ambient 
condition. Additionally, it could be seen that the devices of the gPDI 
showed a higher μC* retention than that of the 2S-gPDI in the first three 
days of aging test, likely originating from a denser surface morphology 
existed in the gPDI film so as to decelerate oxygen diffusion during the 
early days. But overall, it should be realized that even if the active layer 
thickened, the devices of the 2S-gPDI still exhibited a better ambient 
stability than that of the gPDI. 
To gain insight into the aging processes in working organic electro­
chemical devices, the CAS technique was conducted to determine the 
concentration change of polarons in the thin film devices, followed by 
deducing the information about the amount of trapped charges, the 
corresponding state and even the deterioration mechanism [49]. Here 
we tracked the evolution of the spectrum characteristics of both mole­
cule films exposing in air by monitoring the amplitude signal (ΔT/T) for 
21 day. Generally, the CAS spectra displayed two legible spectral fea­
tures that was the new polaron-induced absorption band (ΔT/T < 0) and 
the bleaching of the natural absorption band (ΔT/T > 0), which repre­
sented a formation of polaron state caused by the rearrangement of the 
electronic energy levels following the strong polaronic interaction of the 
additional electron with the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom 
of the molecule [50]. The ΔT/T spectral features can be described by the 
following equation: 
ΔT/T = −σ × ne

chromophores and ne is the density of charge carriers extracted due to 
the voltage change. Fig. 5e, f demonstrated the CAS spectra obtained for 
the gPDI- and 2S-gPDI-based devices during the aging period, in which 
the amplitude signal was that the change of transmission spectrum be­
tween the on-state (0.4 V for gPDI and 0.3 V for 2S-gPDI) and off-state (0 
V) was recorded and then normalized over the off-state transmission 
spectrum. As seen, the intensity of polaron signal and bleaching signal 
for all the devices displayed a consistent trend of decrease with 
increasing aging time, suggesting that both molecules were insuffi­
ciently resisted the oxidation by oxygen. Next, we focused on the in­
tensity variation of the polaron signals during the aging period. Due to 
the strong operation stability, it was reasonably assumed that the or­
dered domains of both molecule films were not damaged at all under the 
doping state and thus the σ value could be regarded a constant value 
during all aging periods. Therefore, the amplitude signal of the polaron 
was a positive correlation with the charge carrier density ne according to 
the equation (2), thus followed by estimating the ne value at different 
aging time. To compare the variation of ne, the normalized charge 
carrier density of the two samples under different aging time was plotted 
in Fig. 5g. For each device, all ne value in different aging time was 
normalized by the ne, 0 obtained at 0 day. The charge carrier density of 
2S-gPDI exhibited a relatively slow loss than that of gPDI, which was in 
accordance with the change trend of their channel current and μC* 
retention (see Fig. 5a-c). Additionally, both compounds’ absorption 
spectra in solution were not obviously changed after 21 days of exposure 
to ambient conditions and voltage application in an aqueous environ­
ment, suggested that no degradation of the compounds was observed 
(see Fig. S12). These results indicated that the 2S-gPDI films could

largely reduce the amount of the oxidative formed OH– group, enabling 
the negative charge carriers to not be easily trapped, and consequently 
showed a better ambient stability than gPDI. Taken overall, the thio­
nation could effectively enhance the ambient stability for n-type 
perylenediimide-based molecules because of the deeper LUMO energy 
level. 
2.6. Film mechanical deformability study 
With these aforementioned results have been concluded that thio­
nation stereoisomer will greatly affect thin film microstructure and 
induce decreased thin film crystallinity. The porous structure is more 
deformable than the dense structure [27]. Therefore at the first time we 
carried out proof-of-concept experiments to build the correlations be­
tween both chemical and microstructures based small-molecule mixed 
conductors and the mechanical deformability. To rapidly evaluate film 
electrical performance under strain, a facile soft contact lamination 
method was adopted, and the processing flow as illustrated in Fig. 6a. 
Specifically, each of the molecules was spin-coated onto a 
dimethyldimethoxysilane-modified glass substrate, followed by trans­
ferring to an elastomeric PDMS slab and stretching incrementally (up to 
50 %). With holding at each strain level, the stretched thin film was 
laminated onto the prefabricated device stack and subsequently the 
corresponding transistor performance have been tested. Note that the 
stretchable film had two different transfer situations according to the 
strain direction was parallel or perpendicular to the charge-transport 
direction, namely parallel or perpendicular device. 
Before the electrical performance characterization, these thin films 
were stretched on supported PDMS substrate, and then their micro- 
morphology changes during the increasing strains from 0 % to 50 % 
were observed by optical microscope, as depicted in Fig. S13. The 
microcracks largely propagated at a 10 % strain were observed for gPDI 
films while the 2S-gPDI films only appeared sparse crack initiation at the 
same strain. We supposed that this phenomenon may cause by their 
different film microstructure morphology, i.e., the porous structure 
enabled to dissipate partial strain energy under low strain stage [51]. 
Furthermore, both films broken into smaller fragments and displayed 
higher crack densities when the strains further applied. Particularly, the 
formed fragment dimension of the 2S-gPDI films was larger than that of 
the gPDI films under a same high-strain condition (25 % and 50 % 
strain), which revealed the different mechanical deformability of both 
molecules. To further link the microscopic observations, we next 
examined the film electrical performance under stretching. For printed 
devices where the strain direction was parallel or perpendicular to the 
channel, their transfer and transconductance curves for two molecules 
were sequentially measured at different tensile strains from 0 % to 50 %, 
showing in Fig. 6b-e and Fig. S14. For both conductors, whether in 
parallel or perpendicular devices, the channel currents and corre­
sponding transconductances were deteriorated with increased strain, in 
which the gPDI films were declined more sharply. Specifically, the gPDI 
films gave an initial channel current/transconductance of 35 μA/0.31 
mS (at 0 % strain, parallel) and 36 μA/0.30 mS (at 0 % strain, perpen­
dicular), while both values decreased to 8 μA/0.08 mS (at 50 % strain, 
parallel) and 10 μA/0.09 mS (at 50 % strain, perpendicular), respec­
tively. Similarly, the channel current/transconductance of the 2S-gPDI 
films under 0 % strain was 149 μA/0.54 mS (in parallel) and 150 μA/ 
0.55 mS (in perpendicular), and these values of the 2S-gPDI films under 
50 % strain were down to 80 μA/0.27 mS (in parallel) and 94 μA/0.34 
mS (in perpendicular). 
For comparing the electrical performance under stretchable state 
more objectively, the μC* retention was used for comparably evaluating 
the electrical performance between both molecules at the same strain, 
hereby determining the deformable ability. Fig. 6f,g and Table S3 por­
trayed the μC* retention of both molecules under different strains along 
the parallel and perpendicular strain directions, in which the μC* 
retention was calculated by referring the μC* value of the film without 
strain. Firstly, the perpendicular devices for both molecules showed a 
superior μC* retention than the parallel devices at each strain, which 
was in good agreement with the previous morphology observation that 
the cracks trended to form along the perpendicular strain directions so 
that it largely impeded charge transport in parallel devices. In addition, 
the μC* retention of both molecule films appeared a decreasing tendency 
with increased strain, regardless of in parallel or perpendicular devices, 
in which a steeper downtrend in gPDI was observed. Specifically, the 
gPDI films possessed a relatively low μC* retention of 81 % (in parallel) 
and 87 % (in perpendicular) at a 10 % strain. In contrast, the 2S-gPDI 
films delivered an impressive μC* retention of 89 % (in parallel) and 
92 % (in perpendicular) at the same strain. With further stretching up to 
50 % strain, the 2S-gPDI films preserved a μC* retention of 47 % (in 
parallel) and 60 % (in perpendicular), significantly outperforming the 
gPDI with a μC* retention of 30 % (in parallel) and 32 % (in perpen­
dicular). Notably, the higher μC* retention of 2S-gPDI in perpendicular 
direction can be ascribed to its face on packing modes since the strain 
direction have relatively lower deleterious effect on the π-π charge 
transport direction, [52] where the strain are easily prone to destroy the 
intermolecular π-π interaction of the edge-on orientation segments of 
gPDI (see Fig. 6h). Additionally, the higher mechanical deformability of 
2S-gPDI is also reflected by the robustness against cyclic stretching (see 
Fig. S15). As for perpendicular devices, the μC* retention of 2S-gPDI is 
nearly unchanged after 20 stretching cycles compared with the single 
stretching while the μC* value was decreased to 75 % of its initial value 
for gPDI-based devices under the same stretchable condition. All these 
results revealed that the 2S-gPDI films exhibited the higher mechanical 
deformability than the gPDI films, attributing to the relative low crys­
tallinity and porous microstructure in the thin film as well as a slightly 
deleterious effect on charge transport in highly face-on orientation films 
under strain. Moreover, in contrast with the reported small molecule 
semiconductors, 2S-gPDI showed an excellent mechanical deformability 
with the highest crack-onset strain values (see Table S4). Our results also 
approved that the high ionic-electronic mixed small molecular n-type 
conduction and the mechanical robustness can be mutually reinforcing. 
3. Conclusion 
In this work, we introduce a novel small molecular n-type mixed 
conduction in OECT containing rigid PDI to form crystalline segments, 
meanwhile introduce dithionated stereoisomer to induce lower crys­
tallinity. This synergistic concept has enabled enhancement in me­
chanical deformability and mixed ionic-electronic conduction as well as 
the ambient stability of OECT devices relative to the commonly explored 
unthionated PDI skeleton. Our findings show that the dithionated ste­
reoisomer PDIs leads to a lower LUMO level and more pronounced 
reduction with stronger ion-uptake ability. The steroisomer also leads to 
simultaneously enhance in both the volumetric capacitance and the 
electron mobility, with μC* of 0.8 F V−1 cm−1 s−1. Furthermore, for the 
first time we systemically investigated the shelf ambient stability and 
mechanical deformable feature of small-molecule OECTs. CAS technique 
demonstrates that the lower loss of charge carrier density in 2S-gPDI 
lead to higher ambient stability. Particularly, we reveal that the 
ambient stability enhancement of 2S-gPDI in thick film can attribute to 
the formation of kinetic barrier to prevent the oxygen penetrating the 
inner film. Furthermore, we build the correlations between both 
chemical and microstructures based the novel small-molecules mixed 
conductors and the mechanical deformability. The higher mechanical 
deformability of 2S-gPDI films can attribute to the relative low crystal­
linity and porous microstructure as well as a slightly deleterious effect 
on charge transport in highly face-on orientation films under strain. Our 
proof-of-concept experiments indicating that the high ionic-electronic 
mixed n-type conduction and the mechanical robustness were also 
mutually reinforcing. Thus, combining the thionation rigid skeleton 
with stereoisomer effect can be an effective strategy to enlarge the 
synthetic toolbox available for developing next-generation high stable
