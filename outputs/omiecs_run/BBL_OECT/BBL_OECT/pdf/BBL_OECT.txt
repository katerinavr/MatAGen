Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are the building blocks of bio-
sensors, neuromorphic devices, and complementary circuits. One rule in the 
materials design for OECTs is the inclusion of a hydrophilic component in the 
chemical structure to enable ion transport in the film. Here, it is shown that 
the ladder-type, side-chain free polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthro
line) (BBL) performs significantly better in OECTs than the donor–acceptor 
type copolymer bearing hydrophilic ethylene glycol side chains (P-90). A 
combination of electrochemical techniques reveals that BBL exhibits a more 
efficient ion-to-electron coupling and higher OECT mobility than P-90. In situ 
atomic force microscopy scans evidence that BBL, which swells negligibly in 
electrolytes, undergoes a drastic and permanent change in morphology upon 
electrochemical doping. In contrast, P-90 substantially swells when immersed 
in electrolytes and shows moderate morphology changes induced by dopant 
ions. Ex situ grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering suggests that the 
particular packing of BBL crystallites is minimally affected after doping, in 
contrast to P-90. BBL’s ability to show exceptional mixed transport is due to 
the crystallites’ connectivity, which resists water uptake. This side chain-free 
route for the design of mixed conductors could bring the n-type OECT perfor-
mance closer to the bar set by their p-type counterparts.

charges throughout the channel ena-
bles OECT operation with gains higher 
than any relevant technology to date and 
driving voltages in the order of a few 
mVs.[1] The high gains rendered OECTs 
favorable for detecting neural activity,[4] 
biochemical species and events,[5,6] and 
as building blocks of neuromorphic com-
puting[7] and printed electrochemical cir-
cuits.[8] In accumulation (enhancement) 
mode OECTs, the channel is intrinsically 
non-conducting and becomes “doped” by 
the ions injected upon the application of 
a gate voltage (VG). The ions stabilize the 
electronic charges simultaneously excited 
in the CP, creating polaronic and bipo-
laronic states. These stabilized charges 
can then be conducted across the channel 
as the drain bias (VD) is applied. The 
reverse gate biasing extracts the ions from 
the bulk back into the electrolyte, and the 
polymer becomes de-doped. We charac-
terize the steady-state characteristics of 
OECTs by measuring the channel cur-
rent (ID) while sweeping VG and VD, from 
which the transconductance (gm) is obtained, which is the first 
and foremost figure of merit of an OECT, indicating its ability 
to transduce ionic-to-electronic signals. Besides the biasing 
conditions, gm is determined by OECT channel geometry and 
CP’s capability to facilitate mixed transport and the density of 
charge pairs. The OECT gm equation in the saturation regime 
is expressed as:
1. Introduction
The organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is the most 
widely investigated and applied device type in organic bioel-
ectronics.[1–3] OECTs use conjugated polymer (CP) films in 
the channel interfacing directly with an electrolyte. The gate 
voltage induced coupling of electrolyte ions with electronic

where W, L, and d are the channel width, length, and thickness, 
respectively, μ is the OECT electronic mobility of the channel, 
C* is the volumetric capacitance, and VT is threshold/turn-on 
voltage. A high gm translates into local amplification, aimed 
when building biosensors.
For ion permeability and transport, hence for high gm, the 
consensus is that the channel material should have a hydro-
philic component. Most OECT polymers share similar back-
bones to those designed for organic field-effect transistors or 
photovoltaics yet employ polar side-chains to transport ions.[2] 
A popular synthetic approach to render conjugated backbones 
(e.g., polythiophene,[9] benzodithiophene,[10] propylenedioxy-
thiophenes,[11] bithiophene-thienothiophene,[12] and naphtha-
lene tetracarboxylic diimide[13,14]) hydrophilic has been grafting 
ethylene glycol (EG) side chains. Most of these CPs are hole-
transporting (p-type), and only a few reports developed elec-
tron-transporting (n-type) polymers.[2,15] Besides their scar-
city, while certain treatments (solvent-induced aggregation or 
n-dopants) improved the performance of the existing n-type 
OECTs,[16,17] they still lag behind the p-type analogs. The lack 
of high-performance n-type mixed conductors is grim for 
OECT applications that aim to monitor electron transfer pro-
cesses such as glucose oxidation[6] or cation movements such 
as during the activity of ion channel proteins.[18] Their scarcity 
also limits applications in electrochemical energy storage[19] 
and complementary circuits.[20] The fundamental challenge of 
n-type polymer implementation is the instability of electronic 
charges in air and water, causing traps and low mobilities. The 
latter necessitates high electrochemical biases to populate a suf-
ficient number of carriers in the lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital (LUMO). However, the electrochemical window of water 
(<1 V) limits the extent to which CPs can be biased before they 
suffer from harmful electrochemical side products, restricting 
the operating range[16,17,21,22] Synthesis of n-types with LUMOs 
deeper than −4 eV mitigates stability issues in ambient environ-
ment,[21,23,24] yet the design of such materials remains extremely 
challenging.
As of now, there are only two types of n-type polymers for 
OECTs; one set of materials is based on a naphthalene-1,4,5,8-
tetracarboxylic-diimide-bithiophene (NDI-T2) based donor–
acceptor type backbone, and the other one is the ladder-type 
polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL). The 
chemical structure of these polymers is not alike, except that 
they both have a naphthalene frame, yet they are both OECT 
materials. The NDI-T2 based polymers were shown to operate 
in OECTs only if they had sufficient EG side-chain content.[14] 
In contrast, despite the absence of EG side-chains or any spe-
cific polar units, BBL OECTs outperform these EG functional-
ized NDI-T2 polymers.[20] Therefore, despite the recent advances 
in understanding OECT channel materials and mixed conduc-
tion, the chemical design principles for n-type mixed conductors 
remain unclear. Besides, polar side chain engineering, consid-
ered almost a necessity for OECT materials design, maybe less 
advantageous than envisaged. The main task of the hydrophilic 
side chains is to allow water/ion uptake and facilitate ion trans-
port inside the water-swollen CP.[14,25] Swelling, however, led to 
undesired side effects such as loss of electronic mobility and pos-
sible film degradation for p-type CPs.[25–29] The studies hypoth-
esized that swollen amorphous regions disconnected regions 
of the film responsible for electronic charge transport. Excess 
swelling led to poor stability due to mechanical stress. Reducing 
swelling of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sul-
fonate films through the addition of a crosslinker improved the 
film mechanical stability but at the cost of both electronic and 
ionic conductivity.[30] This seemingly inherent trade-off can be 
circumvented entirely by avoiding the use of polar components 
altogether if the chains are connected in a way that facilitates ion 
transport while preserving lateral electron transport.
In this study, we construct new design rules for next-gener-
ation n-type CPs for bioelectronics. We systematically investi-
gate and compare the electrochemical charging behavior and 
OECT performance of two n-type polymers, that is, BBL and a 
copolymer based on NDI-T2 backbone bearing EG side chains 
(named as P-90). We selected these two CPs as they perform 
well in aqueous electrolyte gated OECTs despite the significant 
differences in their backbone and although only one of them 
bears polar side chains. P-90 was selected as the representa-
tive of CPs with polar side chains as it was shown to swell sub-
stantially while exhibiting a higher OECT performance than its 
fully glycolated analogue.[14] We find that BBL has around one 
order of magnitude higher OECT mobility than P-90 due to an 
edge-on backbone orientation and tighter packing, as gleaned 
from grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) 
studies. Electrochemical UV–vis spectroscopy and cyclic vol-
tammetry studies evidence that BBL has an earlier onset poten-
tial for electrochemical doping and generates more charges at 
comparable biasing conditions. Electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements show that BBL has nearly 
three times higher C* than P-90. Importantly, BBL does not 
swell in the electrolyte in the absence of bias. During electro-
chemical doping, it, however, swells more than P-90, revealed 
using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipa-
tion monitoring (EQCM-D). In situ atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) measurements show that the morphological changes 
caused by electrolyte uptake during varying doping conditions 
are more drastic and irreversible for BBL. Yet, ion/water uptake 
minimally affects the crystallite structure. Our findings suggest 
that the rod-like, rigid BBL chains self-assemble into an archi-
tecture that enables short contacts that maintain high electron 
mobility while generating ion-permeable regions (envisaged 
as nano-voids). Lastly, besides its excellent steady-state perfor-
mance, the BBL OECTs developed in this study exhibited faster 
response times than the previously reported devices,[20] pushing 
BBL to the front line as an n-type OECT material. Our results 
argue that a particular hydrophilic phase is not required for 
hydrated ion transport as long as the polymer microstructure 
allows free volume for ion penetration.

films upon penetration of anions, we first performed electro-
chemical UV–vis spectroscopy measurements when the films 
were immersed in NaCl (0.1 m) and electrochemically reduced 
or oxidized using an Ag/AgCl electrode. Figure S1, Supporting 
Information shows the evolution of the spectra of the films 
at various biasing conditions. Figure  1b demonstrates the 
absorbance spectra of these films in two selected conditions, 
electrochemically neutral (or de-doped) and reduced state 
obtained when the films were biased at 0.2 and −0.9 V versus 
Ag/AgCl, respectively. In the neutral state, the BBL spectrum 
shows a strong absorption peak around 570 nm, associated with 
the π–π* transition. Upon electrochemical doping, the intensity 
of this peak is slightly reduced while a new and broad band is 
formed in the wavelength range of 700 to 950 nm, associated

with the polaron transition.[20,31] P-90 spectrum shows one 
absorption peak around 400  nm, ascribed to the π–π* transi-
tion, and a second broader feature around 730  nm which is 
attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between 
the donor–acceptor moieties. P-90 spectrum exhibits a reduc-
tion in the ICT band accompanied with an increase in the 
polaron absorption at ≈430 nm,[13,14,16] appearing within a nar-
rower spectral range compared to BBL. The narrower polaron 
band of P-90 is attributed to the charge being mainly local-
ized on the NDI moiety. In contrast, the charge is delocalized 
in the BBL monomer as well as extending to adjacent units, 
indicated by the broader spectral features generated at lower 
energies compared to P-90.[31] In Figure  1c, top, we show the 
changes in the intensity of these absorption features as a func-
tion of applied bias. The spectral changes start occurring at 
lower voltages for BBL compared to P-90, indicating an earlier 
doping onset. The spectra also show more pronounced doping 
in BBL as the increase in polaron absorption at −0.9 V is almost 
double that of P-90. In Figure 1c, bottom, we observe the same 
trend in the amount of injected charge, as well as its onset, 
recorded simultaneously with the absorbance spectra. Note that 
both BBL and P-90 end up facilitating high Faradaic currents, 
meaning the calculated charge cannot be trivially ascribed to 
just electrochemical doping. We come to this conclusion by 
comparing cyclic voltammetry curves performed in ambient 
and O2-depleted environments in Figure  1d,e, which show a 
significant contribution to the current from oxygen reduction 
reaction (ORR). By comparing the highest peak reduction cur-
rent values in ambient and O2-depleted environments, we find 
that around 2/3 and 4/5 of reduction current in BBL and P-90, 
respectively, is due to ORR.
Next, we used EQCM-D to elucidate the amount of mass 
loaded in the films during electrochemical doping. EQCM-D 
provides a means to correlate the combined weight of ions and 
water being injected into polymer films to the charge gener-
ated during biasing, thus, an estimate for ion-to-electron cou-
pling efficiency.[32] At first, we measure the EQCM-D signals 
of both films in air (Figure S2, Supporting Information and 
Figure 2a, step 1). These films are then exposed to O2-depleted 
electrolyte which leads to passive swelling (Figure 2a, step 2). 
In the absence of bias and upon exposure to the electrolyte, 
BBL shows very little (passive) swelling compared to P-90 
(3%  vs 38%, respectively). Once we apply a doping potential, 
both materials show a drastic increase in their mass (Figure 2a, 
step 3). At a voltage at −0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl, BBL swells by 
an additional 63% compared to the 14% of swelling by P-90. 
Figure 2b summarizes the relative swelling percentages of the 
films after exposure to the electrolyte and the application of a 
doping potential.
While these measurements suggest that the mass loaded 
upon doping is higher for BBL compared to P-90, it is not 
yet clear whether this mass can solely be attributed to dopant 
Na+ ions as water may also be dragged into films along with 
ions.[26] We thus performed additional EQCM-D experiments, 
which involved three reduction cycles in a potential window 
between 0.3 and −0.5  V versus Ag/AgCl. The mass taken up 
during these cycles and the corresponding currents recorded 
are shown in Figure  2c. As observed in the single-pulsing 
measurements, BBL loads more mass and generates higher 
reduction currents compared to P-90. Figure  2d shows the 
mass and charge injected into the unit film volume increase 
with doping bias. Considering the earlier reduction onset of 
BBL (Figure  1d,e), even when we compare the swelling for 
BBL at lower doping potentials (e.g., −0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl) and 
P-90. at higher potentials (e.g., −0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl), BBL shows 
larger swelling than P-90. Using the charge density data and 
Faraday’s law of electrolysis, we calculated the Na+ mass den-
sity, assuming that one Na+ ion couples with one electron in the 
film (see the analysis described in detail in the Experimental 
Section). The mass increase that Na+ ions should cause is lower 
than the actual mass uptake. The extra mass on the films is 
thus attributed to water. Figure 2e shows that during doping, 
both films take more water than cations, suggesting that cations 
bring water along with them. The density of Na+ ions and water 
molecules injected into the film is higher for BBL compared to 
P-90. However, when we look at the ratio of water/Na+ taken up 
at each doping potential, we see that for P-90, at voltages below 
−0.4 V, more water is dragged into the film for each dopant ion 
(Figure S3, Supporting Information). Therefore, for P-90, while 
the number of ions taken up is lower, these ions bring more 
water along, especially at low doping potentials.
2.2. OECT Characteristics
As we verified the superior charging ability of BBL over P-90 
and discovered that both films uptake substantial amount of 
water during charging in aqueous electrolytes, we next evalu-
ated the performance of microscale n-type OECTs comprising 
these polymers at the channel. The channels we fabricated 
had a width of 100 µm and a length of 10 µm. OECT transcon-
ductance (gm) and drain current (ID) scale with the thickness 
of the films in the channel; hence we ensured the channel 
thicknesses were comparable for all films studied. Figure 3a,b 
shows a cross-sectional view and wiring of the OECTs, and 
the microscope images of channels spin-cast from representa-
tive solutions. Typical current–voltage characteristics of the 
devices can be found in Figure S4, Supporting Information. 
The transfer curves in Figure 3c show that the BBL channels 
reach an average ID of 13.47 µA at VD = VG = 0.6 V, which is 
more than 70 times higher than the ≈0.18 µA recorded for 
the P-90 channels. Similarly, gm reaches a maximum value of 
around 65.1 µS for BBL (VD  = VG  = 0.6  V) while it remains 
around 0.78 µS (VD = 0.6 V) at VG = 0.5 V for P-90 and drops 
to 0.51 µS at VG = 0.6 V (Figure 3c). We calculate the geometry 
normalized gm values in Figure S5a, Supporting Information. 
BBL exhibits the highest value of 0.815 S cm−1, which is over 90 
times greater than the gm determined for P-90 (0.009 S cm−1). 
Our micron-scale BBL OECTs have higher performance than 
the spray-coated BBL OECT (0.3 S cm−1) reported by Sun 
et al.[20]
Using Equation (1), we can now decouple the main terms 
contributing to the observed difference in device performance: 
the mobility (μ) and the volumetric capacitance (C*) of the 
channel and the voltage overdrive (VG  − VT). The threshold 
voltage (VT), determined from the √ID versus VG curves 
(Figure S5b, Supporting Information), is 0.19  V for BBL and 
0.24 V for P-90. These VT values correlate well with the onset

voltage for the changes in UV–vis spectra and the reduction 
onset observed in CV curves (Figure  1). By substituting the 
dimension and voltage factors into the equation, we plot the 
calculated μC* versus VG curves in Figure 3d. The μC* product 
corresponding to the maximum gm (VG  = 0.6 and 0.5  V, for 
BBL and P-90, respectively) is 1.99 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for BBL and 
3.43 × 10−2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for P-90. μC* product contributes by 
a factor of 58 toward the higher performance in BBL at biasing 
conditions that lead to highest transconductance.
Next, we decouple the μC* product into its components. 
Performing EIS measurements with varying film geometries 
(Figure S6, Supporting Information), we generated capacitance 
versus polymer volume plots (Figure 3e). C* extracted from the 
slope of the linear fit to these plots yield a C* value of 731 F and 
261 F cm−3, for BBL and P-90, respectively. We then determined 
the OECT mobilities using an impedance matching technique 
based on Bernard’s model.[33,34] μ is 2.15 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 
BBL and 7.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for P-90 (Figure 3f). Multiplying

these two independently measured capacitance and mobility 
values yields μC* products of 1.57 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for BBL and  
1.95 × 10−2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for P-90, which gives a μC*(BBL)/μC*(P-90)  
ratio of 80.5, close to the calculated ratio of 58 that we obtained 
from the OECT measurements. Lastly, one of the commonly 
quoted drawbacks of the BBL OECT is its slow response time 
due to slow ion diffusion into the film.[20] Our transient meas-
urements revealed an OECT switch-on time of 5.2 ms for BBL, 
shorter than that of P-90, if not, comparable (Figure S7, Sup-
porting Information). We summarize the OECT characteristics 
and materials figures of merit in Table 1.
2.3. Morphology and Film Microstructure—Impact of Doping
The superior OECT performance of BBL over P-90 came as a 
surprise as 1) the polymer does not have a particular hydro-
philic phase to promote ion transport, and 2) the film uptakes 
substantial water during doping, an excess of which has been 
shown to be detrimental for p-type OECT performance (par-
ticularly for μ).[25,26] To investigate the particular morphology 
and microstructure to give such OECT performance to BBL, 
we performed AFM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
and GIWAXS studies. To monitor the morphology evolution of 
the films in different doping states, AFM and GIWAXS were 
also conducted in operando or ex situ. Figure S8, Supporting 
Information reveals very different dry morphologies for the two 
polymers. While P-90 exhibits a typical fibrillary topography,[35] 
BBL has features clumped into islands of varying sizes. These 
islands are distributed across the surface in an inhomogeneous 
manner with smaller clusters appearing between them, similar 
to the observations of Quintino et al.[36] and Babel et al.[37] AFM 
phase images of BBL films show nanoscale sheets in the range 
of 50–125 nm that are randomly oriented within the film, sim-
ilar to previous reports.[37,38] P-90 film appears smoother with 
an even distribution across the surface. In the TEM images,

P-90 shows a smooth, fibrillar structure as observed in AFM, 
while BBL appears to be much more jagged/flaky and discon-
nected on smaller scales (Figure S9, Supporting Information).
When immersed in 0.1 m NaCl solution (images tagged as 
“Exposed”), P-90 appears relatively flat with a root mean squared 
(RMS) roughness of 3 nm and an average height difference of 
13.5 nm. (Figure 4a, see Table S1, Supporting Information for 
RMS values). The topography exhibits typical fibrillary struc-
tures seen in dry state. When we analyze the height distribution 
on the P-90 surface, we find that it is close to a perfect Gaussian 
shape centered on 13.5 nm (Figure 4c, left). On the other hand, 
BBL has a higher RMS roughness of 31.9 nm and an average 
height difference of 92.1 nm (Figure 4b, Table S1, Supporting 
Information). BBL has a broad height distribution reflecting its 
rough surface peaking at ≈83 nm (Figure 4c, right).
Upon injection of cations at −0.6 V, both polymer films swell, 
and as the voltage increases, so does the size of the features 
(Figure 4a,b). The P-90 height distribution now has a new and 
broadened peak distribution at 16.9 and 23.2 nm upon doping 
at −0.6 and −0.8 V, respectively (Figure 4c). Film surface rough-
ness increases slightly toward 3.6 and 5.6  nm, respectively 
(Table S1, Supporting Information). After dedoping the film 
back to neutral state, the distribution center is shifted to 21 nm, 
while roughness decreases to 4.7 nm, indicating semi-reversible 
morphological changes for P-90 upon electrochemical doping. 
BBL, on the other hand, undergoes these morphological 
changes much more drastically (Figure  4b). First, the surface 
features become larger. The height distribution profile has 
now a three times larger sized peak, 234 and 281 nm at −0.6 
and −0.8  V, respectively (Figure  4c). Film surface roughness 
increases more than double its original value, reaching 68.2 
and 82.7  nm at −0.6 and −0.8  V, respectively (Table S1, Sup-
porting Information). Second, after the films are relaxed back 
to neutral state, both the distribution center and roughness 
remain almost the same. These results agree with the substan-
tial swelling of BBL with water (as well as ions) upon doping 
that we observed in EQCM-D measurements and the large 
mass remaining in the film upon dedoping.
The changes that BBL morphology undergoes upon interac-
tion with electrolyte ions are substantial and irreversible. We 
thus sought to understand the impact of doping on crystallites 
and collected 2D GIWAXS patterns from the dry films, films 
that had undergone ex situ electrolyte exposure, electrochemical 
doping, and electrochemical dedoping, as shown in Figures S10 
and S12, Supporting Information. BBL thin films take on an 
edge-on packing motif with π-stack (010) scattering occurring 
in-plane and lamellar scattering (h00) occurring out-of-plane 
(Figure S12, Supporting Information). In contrast, P-90 takes

on a predominately face-on packing motif, consistent with pre-
vious NDI-T2 polymers,[14,39–41] with π-stack scattering occur-
ring out-of-plane and lamellar scattering occurring both in- and 
out-of-plane. P-90 has significant order along the backbone, as 
evidenced by strong backbone scattering (Figures S11 and S13, 
Supporting Information). Though backbone scattering is absent 
in BBL films, significant order along the backbone direction 
can be inferred from BBL’s ladder structure and the tendency 
of BBL to form long nanobelts following the [001] direction.[42]
Ex situ BBL molecular packing was astonishingly similar to 
the as cast BBL films regardless of electrolyte exposure, elec-
trochemical doping, or electrochemical dedoping, as shown 
in Figure S12, Supporting Information. As a comparison, BBL 
doped 
molecularly 
using 
tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene 
shows a large shift of the lamellar scattering peak, implying 
a lamellar d-spacing expansion of ≈75%.[31] Here, following 
aqueous electrochemical doping, the BBL shows a minimal 
lamellar expansion of 0.1 Å, and π-stack contraction of 0.05 Å.  
The π-stack contraction is reversible upon electrochemical 
dedoping, while the lamellar expansion is not. The ex situ meas-
ured BBL lamellar spacing (even as cast) is such that intercala-
tion and retention of unsolvated cations is geometrically pos-
sible. GIWAXS is not sensitive to swelling in the amorphous 
regions, which, based on the above AFM and EQCM-D data, 
must be considerable. Ex situ grazing incidence small angle 
scattering (GISAXS) revealed a low q feature centered around 
≈0.14 Å−1 that appeared upon electrolyte exposure, diminished 
with doping, and disappeared with dedoping (Figure S14, Sup-
porting Information). This would imply that the ion intercala-
tion upon electrolyte exposure was heterogenous. The length 
scale associated with this peak (≈4.5  nm) is smaller than the 
features (roughness, height) quantified with AFM, but instead 
similar to the coherence lengths of the BBL aggregates/crys-
tallites. Application of a reductive potential to dope the films 
leads to a decrease of this peak, indicating homogenously dis-
tributed dopant ions throughout the film. De-doping the film 
leads to a disappearance of the peak. As AFM and QCM-D evi-
dence irreversible swelling, we postulate this finding to arise 
from trapped electrolyte. In light of the very large increases in 
BBL film thickness and mass upon doping, it is astonishing 
that the molecular packing would be so well preserved. On the 
other hand, P-90 showed more significant changes in thin film 
structure upon electrolyte exposure and electrochemical doping 
(Figure S13, Supporting Information). The largest effect is the 
suppression of out-of-plane lamellar scattering into the back-
ground scattering, implying a disruption to the edge-on ori-
ented crystallites (Figure S13b, Supporting Information).
Quantitative fitting of the BBL and P-90 persisting peaks 
yielded peak positions and coherence length estimates from the 
peak breadths as summarized in Table 2. Comparing the BBL 
and P-90 lamellar and π-stack peaks, we see that order—as esti-
mated by coherence length—was maintained or increased in 
BBL upon ex situ electrolyte exposure, electrochemical doping, 
or electrochemical dedoping. P-90 lamellar and π-stack coher-
ence lengths were diminished slightly by ex situ electrolyte 
exposure or electrochemical doping. For instance, the electro-
chemically doped BBL (010) coherence length increases 9% 
over the as cast film, while the electrochemically doped P-90 
(010) coherence length decreases 15%. Further, the 3.51 Å BBL 
π-stack is tighter than the 3.82 Å P-90 π-stack, and unlike P-90, 
BBL π-stack further contracts when doped. A tighter π-stack is 
generally correlated with improved charge transport, as is edge-
on orientation with π-stacking occurring in the plane of charge 
transport. As opposed to the lamellar and π-stacking, the P-90 
backbone order is not disrupted by ex situ electrolyte exposure 
or electrochemical doping. While such order is beneficial for 
charge transport in undoped field effect devices,[43] the degree 
of charge carrier localization likely inhibits intra-chain trans-
port down the backbone that would benefit from this extended 
order.[44] This is opposed to BBL which shows evidence of delo-
calized charge carriers.[31]
3. Discussion
Our OECT characterization demonstrates that BBL performs 
significantly better than P-90 due to the higher electronic 
mobility and volumetric capacitance. In the absence of side-
chains, the amount of space that is taken up by the conju-
gated backbone is larger, which increased BBL’s charge storage

capacity to almost triple that of P-90. Here, the unexpected 
result is the ion penetration and transport in a film like BBL. 
Previous studies suggested that for a high C* value, the mate-
rial requires a hydrophilic component to accommodate ionic 
conduction, which, in the case of P-90, is the EG side-chains. 
Giovannitti et  al. demonstrated that changing the hydrophilic 
fraction can be used to tune μOECT and C* of n-type films, but 
improving one came at the cost of the other.[14] BBL has no 
such obvious hydrophilic component and appears to bypass the 
trade-off between μOECT and C* parameters.
Considering high C* and low reduction onsets, it is clear that 
cations have no barrier to penetrate the BBL film and couple 
with electrons therein. Once cations find their electron pairs, 
the higher mobility of BBL thus comes as no surprise, as the 
chain planarity, packing, and orientation are optimal for lateral 
electronic transport. The advantageous combination of edge-
on packing, tight π-stacking, electrolyte and electrochemical 
doping induced order improvement, and charge carrier delo-
calization in BBL films, all would facilitate charge transport. 
P-90, on the other hand, has the disadvantageous combina-
tion of face-on packing, electrolyte and electrochemical doping 
induced disorder, and charge carrier localization.
Hydrophilic side chains offer a simple means of enhancing 
ionic conductivity within a polymer film. Side chain engi-
neering can also promote solubility in common organic sol-
vents and, as such, provide flexibility in processing. However, 
side chains may also hinder the self-assembly of chains into 
highly electronically conducting structures and lead to dis-
ruption of crystalline regions during doping. Our GIWAXS 
studies suggest a preserved backbone architecture and tighter 
π-stacking for BBL despite excessive swelling upon doping as 
shown by EQCM-D and in situ AFM studies. Doping, on the 
other hand, disrupts edge-on oriented crystallites and increases 
lamellar and π-stack coherence lengths for P-90. Our previous 
studies showed that excessive water uptake irreversibly dis-
torts polymer morphology, which diminishes the electronic 
mobility.[26] Ginger and colleagues hypothesized that water 
intercalating in the amorphous regions causes swelling and 
disrupts the connectivity between the crystalline regions.[25] 
For P-90, we estimated more water dragged into the film for 
the same amount of dopant ions. In contrast to BBL, the amor-
phous content and bulky EG chains that attract water makes 
P-90’s structure and electron transport pathways more vulner-
able to ion induced swelling.
BBL chains exhibit large persistence lengths of up to 
≈153  nm (limited by the overall chain length),[45] whereas the 
persistence length of the NDI-T2 backbone appears to be lim-
ited to ≈26  nm, regardless of the overall chain length.[46] We 
suggest that rigid long chains of BBL extend across amorphous 
regions connecting multiple crystallites. Although dry AFM 
and TEM images showed no porosity for BBL in the length 
scales that we could investigate, we postulate that these inter 
crystallite disordered regions have enough void space to allow 
electrolyte intercalation, as evidenced by GISAXS. The rigid-
chain architecture maintains the integrity of electron conduc-
tion pathways despite swelling and ion uptake. In P-90, on the 
other hand, ions interact with EG side chains and water, espe-
cially in the swollen amorphous regions, disrupting crystallite 
connectivity necessary for efficient charge transport.
4. Conclusions
We demonstrated that the ladder-type polymer BBL outper-
forms the NDI-T2 based glycolated P-90 random copolymer 
as the OECT channel material. By employing frequency 
dependent measurements, we found that the electronic OECT 
mobility of BBL is ≈28 times and its volumetric capacitance is 
≈2.8 times higher than that of P-90. Because BBL does not have 
any hydrophilic side-chains, one would expect lower electrolyte 
affinity and lower ion-electron coupling capability in aqueous 
environments, as seen in alkylated NDI-T2 derivatives. How-
ever, both EQCM-D and UV–vis spectroscopy demonstrated 
that BBL has an earlier reduction onset and facilitates a higher 
degree of swelling upon electrochemical reduction and elec-
trochromic response compared to P-90. BBL accommodated a 
higher density of cations and water during its electrochemical 
reduction, which remained partially in the film upon dedoping. 
On the other hand, the water-to-cation ratio was higher for 
P-90. In situ AFM images showed that during doping, the 
feature size and surface roughness of BBL increases drasti-
cally and abruptly, compared to the more gradual and modest 
changes seen in P-90, in agreement with EQCM-D results. 
GIWAXS studies showed that electrolyte uptake in the BBL 
film during doping did not disrupt molecular packing, which is 
not the case for P-90. We hypothesize that the structural resist-
ance to water originates from the planarity of BBL chains and 
lack of ion-coordinating side-chains. This architecture provides 
efficient transport routes for electronic carriers, while permit-
ting electrolyte intercalation in intermolecular void space. BBL 
should be considered as a new model system for the design 
of mixed conductors since this rigid-backbone, side chain-free 
route results in the highest ever n-type OECT performance and 
efficient mixed conduction at the aqueous electrolyte interface.
5. Experimental Section
Materials: P-90 was synthesized using an existing protocol.[14] BBL 
was purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used as received.
Device Preparation: OECTs were fabricated using an established 
photolithography process on 4-inch glass wafers. The wafers were 
cleaned using a piranha (H2O2:H2SO4, ratio 1:3–4) bath, washed with 
water and cleaned with O2 plasma (Nanoplas DSB 6000). The OECT 
components (channels, pads, and interconnects) were defined using 
standard photolithography steps. To perform the lift-off step, the wafers 
were coated with a photoresist bilayer consisting of LOR 5B (Microchem) 
and S1813 (Shipley), and exposed to UV light using the EVG 6200 mask 
alignment system and developed using MF319 developer. A 10  nm 
layer of Cr and a 100 nm layer of Au were deposited using magnetron 
sputtering (Equipment Support Company Ltd. ESCRD4) and lifted using 
appropriate solvents. After the lift-off step, the first Parylene C layer was 
vaporized to a thickness of 1.7 µm using a SCS Labcoater 2 with Silane 
as an adhesion promoter. A second Parylene C layer was vaporized to 
act as the sacrificial layer for polymer film patterning. A layer of AZ9260 
was spun cast and developed using AZ developer as a mask for reactive 
ion etching (Oxford Instruments Plasmalab 100–ICP 380) which was 
used to expose the device channels and pads for polymer deposition. 
P-90 was prepared in a chloroform solution, while BBL was prepared 
in a methanesulfonic acid (MSA) solution, keeping a 5  mg.mL−1 
concentration for both polymer solutions. P-90 films were spin-coated at 
1500 rpm, for 30 s. BBL films were spin-coated using a two-step process: 
1000  rpm for 60 s, during which the films settled and 3000  rpm for 
15 s to remove excess solution. After spin-coating, the BBL films were

immersed in DI water for 30  min to remove MSA from the film. The 
films were then annealed at 200 °C for 1 h.
Device Characterization: A Keithley source-meter unit and a dual-
channel source-meter unit (NI-PXI) with custom-written LabView control 
codes were used for OECT characterization. An Ag/AgCl pellet (2 mm × 
2 mm, Warner instruments) was used as the gate electrode, immersed 
into aqueous 0.1 m NaCl solution contained in a PDMS well placed on 
top of the OECTs. To find the electron transit time (τe) and the electronic 
mobility (μe-OECT), transconductance frequency response measurements 
were performed as described by Rivnay et al.[34] A constant drain voltage 
(VD = 0.6 V) and gate voltage (VG = 0.6 or 0.5 V) along with a sinusoidal 
gate voltage modulation (ΔVG = 50 mV) was applied over a frequency 
range from 1  Hz to 20  kHz. The gate current (IG) and drain current 
(ID) as well as the associated amplitude and phase shift responses 
were collected and analyzed with a custom-made LabView code. The 
frequency domain relation between IG and ID can be described as:

where L is the channel length, τe is the extracted electron transit time,

Electrochemical Analysis: Cyclic voltammograms were measured using 
a Metrohm Autolab potentiostat using the standard three-electrode 
setup at a 50  mV s−1 scan rate in air or in a N2-filled glovebox. The 
polymer films spin-coated on gold substrates (2 × 2 cm) acted as the 
working electrodes, with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and 
an Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. A 0.7 mm diameter PDMS well 
was used to contain the 300  µL of NaCl(aq), into which the counter 
and reference electrodes were immersed. EIS was performed on 
microelectrode arrays with Au electrodes coated with the polymers. The 
sizes of these microelectrodes ranged from 400 to 94 950 µm2 and were 
patterned using photolithography as described for the OECTs above. A 
Metrohm Autolab potentiostat over a frequency range from 100 kHz to 
0.1 Hz with a 10 mV modulation amplitude was used. Capacitances were 
calculated from the impedance magnitude equation:

where C is the capacitance and f is frequency. Volumetric capacitance 
was obtained from the slope of the extracted capacitance versus film 
volume curve.
Spectroelectrochemical Analysis: Measurements were performed using 
an Ocean Optics HL-2000-FHSA halogen light source, directed through 
a redox.me sample holder (MM SPECTRO-EFC) using QP600-1-SR-BX 
optical fibers and fed back to the Ocean Optics QE65 Pro Spectrometer. 
The OceanView software was first calibrated using a blank ITO substrate 
placed in the sample holder. The polymers films were spin-coated on 
ITOs and placed into the sample holder in direct contact with 1.3 mL of 
NaCl(aq) 0.1 m. A Keithley 2602A source meter was connected to the ITO 
surface and an Ag/AgCl electrode (redox.me—Ag/AgCl 30 mm) which 
was inserted into the electrolyte. The samples were electrochemically 
cycled using the Keithley source-meter unit, which provided a ramp 
voltage from 0.2 to −0.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl) with a 0.1 V step for a duration 
of 5 min. Absorbance was recorded automatically using the OceanView 
software.

Monitoring: Measurements were performed using the QSense Analyzer, 
a QSense Electrochemistry Module (QEM 401), and gold with titanium 
adhesion layer sensors (QSensors QSX 338) from Biolin Scientific in 
deoxygenated electrolytes bubbled continuously with argon gas. The 
analyzer measured the shift and dissipation of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 
9th, and 11th frequency harmonics which provide information about 
the changes in sample mass and softness. First, the bare sensors were 
measured in air and after introducing NaCl(aq) 0.1 m. The electrolyte 
resulted in a large shift in the QCM-D signals due to the change in media 
density inside the chamber, which needs to be taken into consideration 
when calculating polymer swelling. After acquiring QCM-D baseline 
signals in both dry and wet conditions, the measured sensor was coated 
with a polymer film and placed back into the analyzer. The QCM-D 
signals were recorded again in dry state and with electrolyte after making 
sure that the f and D signals were stabilized (i.e., Δf < 0.1 Hz per 5 min). 
Using the QSoft software function “stitch data” provided the difference 
between the f and D signals before and after the sensor was coated with 
a polymer film in both dry state and with electrolyte. This difference was 
used to calculate the film areal mass in dry and swollen states, using the 
Sauerbrey equation:

where Δfn is the frequency shift of the nth overtone, A is the sensor 
active area, ρq is the density of quartz, Vq is the shear wave velocity in 
quartz, f0 is the fundamental frequency and n is the overtone number. 
Film thickness was calculated by dividing the calculated areal mass with 
film density.
EQCM-D was performed using an Autolab PGstat128N potentiostat 
coupled with a QSense electrochemistry module (QEM 401). The 
integrated three-electrode setup comprised a Ag/AgCl reference 
electrode, Pt counter electrode, and the polymer-coated Au QSensor 
acting as the working electrode with an electrochemical active area of 
0.7854 cm2.
Physical modeling of the measured f and D signals was done 
based on observed film characteristics. Films exhibiting a low degree 
of swelling and little to no energy losses were considered “rigid” and 
modeled using the Sauerbrey equation.

Na+ density was determined by calculating the number of electrons 
injected into the polymer film from the recorded working electrode 
current and assuming a 1:1 electron-to-cation coupling. H2O density 
was determined by subtracting the injected Na+ mass (3.81763 × 10−23 g 
per atom) from the total electrochemically injected mass and dividing 
by water molecular mass (2.99158 × 10−23  g per molecule). Possible 
contributions of counter ions or faradaic reactions on mass uptake and 
measured current were not considered.

coated films on ITO using FESPA-V2 probes commercialized by Bruker 
(nominal resonant frequency: 75 KHz, spring constant: 2.8 N m−1). 
In electrolyte scans were obtained using the Bruker SCANASYST-
FLUID module mounted with Scanasyst-fluid probes commercialized 
by Bruker (nominal resonant frequency: 150 KHz, spring constant:  
0.7 N m−1). Sample and probe were both immersed in PBS while 
scanning. Doping of the film was achieved in PBS with a two-electrode set 
up, the film spin coated on ITO and an Ag/AgCl pellet were connected to 
a potentiostat (PalmSens, PalmSens4). Doping of the film was performed 
applying the desired voltage versus an Ag/Ag/Cl reference for at least  
10 min. Scans were taken immediately after doping. Preparation of the 
films was consistent with the other experiments (P-90: 1500 rpm for 30 s; 
BBL: 1000 rpm for 1 min then 3000 rpm for 15 s). Gwyddion software was 
used for statistical data and post-treatment.
Transmission Electron Microscopy: BBL and P-90 films were spin-
coated onto glass substrates using the same conditions as in other 
experiments. Both films were floated onto DI water and transferred onto 
TEM grids (Agar Scientific 200 mesh cupper, Formvar/Carbon). BBL 
covered grids were annealed at 200 °C for 1 h. The P-90 and BBL films’ 
morphology were investigated by bright-field imaging on FEI TECNAI

NaCl(aq) for 30 min, and drying (exposed); spin-coating, drying, exposing 
to 0.1 m NaCl(aq) for 30 min, doping at −0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 30 min, 
and drying (doped); spin-coating, drying, exposing to 0.1 m NaCl(aq) for 
30 min, doping at −0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 30 min, dedoping at 0 V (vs 
Ag/AgCl) for 30 min, and drying (de-doped). Data were processed with 
the GIXSGUI package for MATLAB,[47] and line cuts were fit with custom 
MATLAB code.
