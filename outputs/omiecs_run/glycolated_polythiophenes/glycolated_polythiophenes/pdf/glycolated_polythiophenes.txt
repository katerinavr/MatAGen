Electrochemical doping of organic mixed ionic–electronic conduc-
tors is key for modulating their conductivity, charge storage and
volume enabling high performing bioelectronic devices such as
recording and stimulating electrodes, transistors-based sensors
and actuators. However, electrochemical doping has not been
explored to the same extent for modulating the mechanical proper-
ties of OMIECs on demand. Here, we report a qualitative and
quantitative study on how the mechanical properties of a glyco-
lated polythiophene, p(g3T2), change in situ during electrochemical
doping and de-doping. The Young’s modulus of p(g3T2) changes
from 69 MPa in the dry state to less than 10 MPa in the hydrated
state and then further decreases down to 0.4 MPa when electro-
chemically doped. With electrochemical doping–dedoping the
Young’s modulus of p(g3T2) changes by more than one order of
magnitude reversibly, representing the largest modulation reported
for an OMIEC. Furthermore, we show that the electrolyte concen-
tration affects the magnitude of the change, demonstrating that in
less concentrated electrolytes more water is driven into the film
due to osmosis and therefore the film becomes softer. Finally, we
find that the oligo ethylene glycol side chain functionality, specifi-
cally the length and asymmetry, affects the extent of modulation.
Our findings show that glycolated polythiophenes are promising
materials for mechanical actuators with a tunable modulus similar
to the range of biological tissues, thus opening a pathway for new
mechanostimulation devices.
Introduction
Organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (OMIECs) are consid-
ered key materials for bioelectronics because of their mixed ionic/
electronic transport, biocompatibility, solution processability and
electrochemical actuation.1,2 OMIECs volumetric charging has
been exploited for enhanced signal transduction in electrodes3
and electrochemical transistors4,5 as well as in actuators6 due to
the voltage-induced volume changes. Furthermore, solution pro-
cessability enables additive manufacturing for 3D structures as
well as material integration into various substrates such as fiber
and textiles for tissue engineering, wearables, and soft robotics.7–9
The soft nature of the OMIECs brings also promise for a better
mechanical match with the biological world.10 However, even
though most OMIECs are softer than inorganic semiconductors
and metals, they are still much stiffer than tissue, exhibiting
Young’s modulus from hundreds of MPa to GPa, mostly depend-
ing on crystallinity and chain alignment.11,12
Diﬀerent strategies have been investigated for modulating
the Young’s modulus of OMIECs.13,14 Engineering composites
of conducting polymers and hydrogels has been extensively
studied, as hydrogels are biocompatible, as soft as tissues and
allow flexible fabrication.15–17 These composites result in an

New concepts
The properties of organic mixed ionic–electronic conductors (OMIECs)
can be modulated via electrochemical doping. While the changes in
conductivity, charge storage and volume during electrochemical doping
have been widely studied, how the mechanical properties change is fairly
unexplored. This work shows that for a glycolated polythiophene,
p(g3T2), the Young’s modulus can change more than one order of
magnitude with electrochemical doping–dedoping, the largest modula-
tion reported so far. The dynamic range of the Young’s modulus of
p(g3T2) matches that of biological tissues, opening a pathway for the
development of soft actuators for on demand mechanostimulation of
biological
systems.
This
work
also
contributes
to
furthering
our
understanding on the fundamental doping process in OMIECs as we
show that osmotic phenomena take place during doping and are affected
by the molecular design and by the electrolytic environment.

interpenetrating network of conducting polymers within the
hydrogel bulk and therefore have improved mechanical proper-
ties but at the cost of reduced electronic conductivity.18–21
Recently, a pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogel was reported, based on
an interconnected network of pure polymer fibrils, without the
need of any additional cross-linking, resulting in a material
with a low Young’s modulus and good electrical and electro-
chemical properties.22 Synthetic design23,24 and molecular doping
have also been explored for modulating the mechanical properties
of OMIECs. Stiff polymers with a Young’s modulus higher than
100 MPa usually have high crystallinity due to enhanced p–p
stacking, and molecular doping only slightly reduces their
stiffness.25 Softer polymers on the other hand, have lower crystal-
linity and more amorphous regions, and in this case, doping
results in stiffening due to increase in crystallinity.25,26 In p(g42T-
T), a polythiophene with tetraethylene glycol side chains, doping
with F4TCNQ increases the Young’s modulus from 8 to 232 MPa
while doping with F2TCNQ induces an even higher change
reaching Young’s modulus values of 377 MPa, the largest mod-
ulation reported so far with molecular doping.
While molecular doping is a promising route for tuning the
mechanical properties of OMIECs,19,27 modulation on demand
with external stimuli, such as voltage or light, can open new
possibilities as mechanostimulation and adaptive interfaces.
Electrochemical doping is a dynamic, reversible process where
injected charges in the polymer backbone are compensated by ions
that migrate from the electrolyte to the polymer matrix together
with water molecules, resulting in volume expansion.28–30 During
dedoping, electronic charges are extracted from the backbone and,
at the same time, ions and water are expelled from the polymer
matrix, resulting in volume contraction. Even though the electro-
chemical doping processes and volumetric changes have been
widely investigated in conducting polymers,31–38 not many studies
have focused on how their mechanical properties are affected
per se during doping-induced volume change. Qualitatively such
correlation has been evaluated with electrochemical quartz crystal
microbalance with dissipation module (eQCM-D) showing
that doping and solvent ingress render the polymers more
viscoelastic.28,29 Quantitative studies were performed with
AFM coupled to electrochemical module and electrochemical
strain microscopy for the model polymers PEDOT:PSS12 and
P3HT,39 respectively. These studies revealed that the ion
uptake, accompanied by electrolyte ingress, affects the local
order and modulates the electronic conductivity as well as the
mechanical properties.
While there is a clear indication that it is possible to tune
the mechanical properties of OMIECs through electrochemical
doping, this possibility remains largely unexplored. Recently we
reported an OMIEC that exhibits a record volume change
during electrochemical doping based on a thiophene backbone
with triethylene glycol side chains (p(g3T2)).40–42 We demon-
strated that during the first electrochemical oxidation, p(g3T2)
expands by more than 1000% undergoing a solid to gel transi-
tion resulting in a conducting hydrogel as a single component
material. Molecular dynamics revealed that the polymer back-
bones shift creating a nanoporous matrix while still maintain-
ing percolation pathways and that the ethylene glycol (EG) side
chains stabilize water molecules.41 During subsequent electro-
chemical cycling, p(g3T2) expands reversibly by 250–300%,
which has been exploited for electroactive filters.43
Here, we demonstrate that we can reversibly modulate the
mechanical properties of p(g3T2) with electrochemical doping.
With electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipa-
tion module (eQCM-D) we qualitatively correlate the changes in
mass and volume with changes in the viscoelastic properties
and show that p(g3T2) becomes softer when doped and stiﬀens
when dedoped. With in situ electrochemical atomic force
microscopy (EC-AFM) we find that the Young’s modulus of
p(g3T2) in the pristine state is in the order of MPa and
decreases by more than one order of magnitude when electro-
chemically doped. Furthermore, by using aqueous electrolytes
with diﬀerent ionic strengths, we decouple the contribution of
ions and water to the volume change and hence to the change
in mechanical properties. Finally, we study a series of poly-
thiophenes with varying EG side chain functionalities and show
that the change in mechanical properties is highly dependent
on side chain functionality.
Results
First, we characterized p(g3T2)’s solid to gel conversion, i.e.,
from pristine to the electrochemically doped state (+0.5 V vs.
Ag/AgCl) and back to the electrochemically reduced state
(0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in varying KCl electrolyte concentrations
from 0.01 M to 1 M (Fig. 1). A p(g3T2) coated carbon fiber was
mounted in an electrochemical cell as the working electrode
and the polymer volume change upon electrochemical addres-
sing was recorded by microscopy. The relative polymer expan-
sion [(Vpristine  Voxidized)/Vpristine)] and contraction [(Voxidized 
Vreduced)/Voxidized] were then calculated (Fig. 1(C)), as detailed in
Methods and Supporting Information S1 (ESI†).

We found that p(g3T2)’s expansion upon doping decreases
by one order of magnitude, from 4112  1150% to 384  95%
when the electrolyte changes from 0.01 M to 0.1 M KCl. For
even higher electrolyte concentration, 1 M KCl, the polymer
expansion decreases further to 96  11% (Fig. 1(C)). After the
initial couple of cycles, the relative polymer volume change
stabilizes for up to 300 cycles. At the 100th cycle p(g3T2)’s
relative volume change is 195  6% in 0.01 M KCl, 97  27% in
0.1 M KCl and 59  4% in 1 M KCl following the decreasing
trend of the volume change with increasing KCl concentration
(Fig. S2, ESI†).
To get a better insight on the associated changes on the
polymer properties, we then performed electrochemical-quartz
crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (eQCM-D) on

p(g3T2) thin films coated on Au quartz crystals. eQCM-D gives
simultaneous information on the changes in the mass and
viscoelastic properties by monitoring the changes in frequency
(F) and dissipation (D), respectively.44 The F and D changes
(DF and DD) are usually reported as a function of time
(Fig. 1(D), left). To have a more straightforward comparison
between the diﬀerent conditions, we propose here a diﬀerent
data visualization for the eQCM-D data. We report the DD as a
function of DF, which will be referred from now on as ‘‘D(F)
plot’’: this allows the visual representation of the correlation
between mass increase and softening of the material and the
qualitative assessment of the influence of the electrolyte
concentration (Fig. 1(D), right). As the increase in frequency
represents a mass decrease, and an increase in dissipation
represents the softening of the material, if the viscoelastic data
are moving towards the first quadrant of the D(F) plot, it means
that the material is losing mass and softening at the same time.
Hence, we can identify the four quadrants as follows: (I) mass
loss and softening; (II) mass loss and stiﬀening; (III) mass
increase and stiﬀening; (IV) mass increase and softening. For
p(g3T2), at each concentration, we record the viscoelastic
properties for 30 s in the pristine state, and then we apply
the oxidation voltage (expansion, +0.5 V) for 30 s while record-
ing the F and D values; finally, we apply the reduction voltage
(contraction, 0.5 V) for 30 s still recording the F and D. We
then select one point every 3 s and we report it in the D(F) plot:
under each condition (pristine, +0.5 V and 0.5 V), a total of
10 points are reported, which represent the time evolution of
the change in viscoelastic properties.
We observe that when p(g3T2) expands, the viscoelastic
properties change towards the IV quadrant for all electrolytes;
hence, the frequency decreases while the dissipation increases,
indicating mass increase and softening of the polymer (Table 1
and Fig. 1(E)). Similarly to the observed volume change, the
eﬀect is more pronounced for the 0.01 M electrolyte, while it
becomes less strong with increasing electrolyte concentration.
When p(g3T2) contracts, we observe mass loss and stiﬀening of
the films as indicated by frequency and dissipation changes
towards the values of the pristine state. For 0.01 M and 0.1 M, F
and D do not return to the initial values indicating that the
more the polymer is expanded, the bigger is the irreversible
eﬀect on the polymer structure. This break-in eﬀect can be
explained by water and ions that remain in the film after
contraction, combined with irreversible changes of the polymer
chain conformation and reorganization of the polymer matrix
upon expansion.12,28 Indeed, molecular dynamics calculations
have shown that during expansion, the polymer chains slide
along each other creating pores while still interacting via the
p–p stacking of the backbones.40 The hydrophilic EG-side
chains possibly stabilize the water and ions in the film. Indeed,
water has been shown to contribute to the volumetric expan-
sion of a similar oligothiophene polymer (p(gT2-TT)),28 thus a
similar behavior for p(g3T2) is expected. Furthermore, it has
been shown that after applying a reducing potential, p(g3T2)
recovers its initial absorption spectrum,42 indicating that the
doping/dedoping process per se is reversible.
Overall, the observed changes in mass and softness probed
by eQCM-D for p(g3T2) in the diﬀerent electrolytes agree with the
trends of the volume changes observed in the fiber geometry. To
quantitatively evaluate the changes in the polymer film mechan-
ical properties we performed in situ electrochemical atomic force
microscopy (EC-AFM) during electrochemical addressing.
For EC-AFM, the polymer was deposited by spin coating on a
gold substrate, acting as working electrode in a three-electrode
cell setup. Imaging of the topography and indentations was
performed in situ under dry and wet conditions (diﬀerent
electrolyte concentrations) as well as under diﬀerent applied
potentials.
The polymer films in the dry state show a distinct fibrillar
morphology with bunches of fibers packed in compact features
and holes, 30–50 nm in diameter, were present in between
them. When hydrated in a KCl electrolyte solution (without
application of bias), this morphology is still clearly visible, but
the elongated features appear wider, especially in diluted
electrolyte (Fig. 2(B), and (C)) signifying passive swelling. The
root mean square roughness, RRMS, does not change much after
hydration, going from 3.02  1.23 nm in the dry state to 2.78 
0.22, 2.92  1.36 and 3.60  2.13 nm for KCl 0.01, 0.1 and 1 M,
respectively (Fig. 2(D) and Table 2). When the polymer is
electrochemically oxidized, a distinct change in the morphol-
ogy occurs, with wider and taller features as well as larger
spaces in between them (Fig. 2(A) and (B)) in agreement
with the volume changes observed via microscopy. The RRMS
increases to 12.55  2.14 and 5.51  0.27 for KCl 0.01 and
0.1 M, respectively, while it does not change for KCl 1 M (2.46 
0.38 nm). Upon reduction, RRMS remains high for KCl 0.01M
(13.39  5.15 nm), while it decreases to pristine values for KCl
0.1 (3.11  0.41 nm) and 1 M (3.37  1.68 nm).
When the films are electrochemically reduced (dedoped),
the surface topography does not recover to the pristine
hydrated state with clear distinct fibrils, but exhibits a more
amorphous and slightly swollen surface. The irreversible
changes in topography are more pronounced for 0.01 M KCl
electrolyte in agreement with the irreversible break-in eﬀects in
mass and volume described in the previous section. Indenta-
tions at a constant loading force were performed to measure

force–displacement curves and extract the Young’s modulus of
each sample in the different electrolytes and under different
applied potentials. The trend in Young’s modulus correlates
with the trends observed for volume expansion as well as mass
and dissipation changes (Fig. 1). In the dry state, the thin films
of p(g3T2) have a Young’s modulus of 68.04  8.9 MPa (Fig. 2),
which decreases up to one order of magnitude once exposed to
the electrolytes, with no clear trend between the electrolyte
concentrations. In contrast, when p(g3T2) is expanded, the
Young’s modulus decreases further with increasing electrolyte
concentration, with values of 0.41  0.08, 1.71  0.51 and
3.18  0.51 MPa in 0.01, 0.1 and 1 M KCl, respectively (Table 3).
Once p(g3T2) is contracted again (0.2 V), the polymer’s
Young’s moduli are increasing again to values of 3.12  1.4,
9.03  2.64 and 11.14  2.68 MPa in 0.01, 0.1 and 1 M KCl,
respectively. In agreement with previous observations, the
initial film properties are recovered for 0.1 and 1 M KCl, while
in the case of 0.01 M the Young’s modulus is only about half as
high as for the electrolyte exposed pristine films.
The electrochemically controllable Young’s modulus of
p(g3T2) with values between 0.4 MPa and 11 MPa is similar
to that of a wide range of tissues,45 highlighting the potential of
p(g3T2) for biointerface applications.
To further elucidate the mechanisms involved during poly-
mer expansion and the role of electrolyte concentration, we
attempted to decouple the contribution of ions and water in the
volume change. Assuming that during doping each hole is
compensated by one anion (1h+:1Cl), we calculated the
expected mass change due to the anion intake. We found that
the anion mass intake is independent of the electrolyte concen-
tration (Fig. 3(A)), indicating that the polymer reaches the same
doping level and in agreement with previously reported results
for similar polymers.28 In contrast, the mass change recorded

by the eQCM-D is concentration dependent, and much bigger
than the calculated mass change due to the anion intake
(Fig. 3(A)). Even by including the hydration shell of the anions
(according to ref. 46, reported in Fig. S3, ESI†), the calculated
mass is still lower than the mass recorded with the eQCM-D,
indicating that water molecules not associated with the anions
still enter the film.
The mass change as a function of time is described by a two-
phase exponential decay with a fast and a slow components,
with time constants of tmass_1 = 1.13  0.37 s and tmass_2 =
66.1  16.8 s, respectively (Fig. 3(B)). On the other hand, the
associated current is described by a single-phase exponential
decay with a faster time constant, (tRC = 0.24  0.08 s). The
charge compensation is the first occurring phenomenon, fol-
lowed by the mass increase. The charge compensation occurs
over time, reaching an equilibrium of almost zero Ampere, like
the profile of a charging capacitor. As it is described by an
exponential, after a timeframe equivalent to 5tRC the current
reaches 99% of the final value; hence, it is considered fully
charged. Noteworthy, the first time constant of the mass falls
within the extinction of the charge compensation (tmass_1 o
5tRC), possibly associated with ions moving in the polymer due
to the sudden change in the electric field,47 while the second
one is two orders of magnitude slower (tmass_2 c 5tRC). This
signifies that extra water is driven in the polymer, as the charge
compensation is already completed. We then calculated the
time constants related to the viscoelastic properties by fitting
the dissipation change. In this case as well, the dissipation
change is described with two time constants that are bigger
than the ones of mass change, indicating that the viscoelastic
properties change as a consequence of the anion and water
intake. The time constant of the current, i.e., the charging
speed, is not aﬀected by the electrolyte concentration (Fig. 3(C),
exact values reported in Table 4), in agreement with previous
findings.28,48,49 Both tmass_1 and tdiss_1 are only slightly aﬀected by
the electrolyte concentration, indicating that the charge compensa-
tion by the anions aﬀects the volumetric change and the elastic
properties only to a small extent. On the contrary, the time constants
depending on water intake (tmass_2 and tdiss_2) are aﬀected, becom-
ing up to 5 times slower in KCl 1 M compared to 0.01 M.
One question that remains is: what drives the extra water to
enter the polymer matrix after the anions have compensated
the electronic charges? From the time constants of the various
processes, we hypothesize that once the hydrated anions enter
into the polymer matrix, the latter behaves as a semipermeable
membrane.28 In the polymer matrix, the concentration of water
molecules and ions is diﬀerent from the one in the electrolyte,
which creates a concentration gradient that drives water mole-
cules into the polymer due to osmotic forces. In agreement with
this hypothesis, in the more diluted electrolyte, we recorded the
higher volumetric change for a comparable polymer charging
(Fig. S4, ESI†), as the concentration gradient of water and ions
between polymer and surrounding electrolyte is bigger. By
increasing the ionic strength, the concentration gradient
decreases, resulting in less water intake, as well as smaller
volume change. Indeed, by calculating the anion concentration
we found that the concentration of the anions in the expanded
polymer is higher than that in the electrolyte (Fig. S5, ESI†).
To investigate if the polymer’s molecular structure impacts
the changes in the volume and viscoelastic properties during
electrochemical addressing, we studied using eQCM-D a series
of polythiophenes with EG side chains varying in length and
asymmetry (Fig. 4(A)) while keeping the total number of EG
units constant.42

From D(F) plots of pristine and expanded state we clearly see
that by increasing the side chain asymmetry, the changes in
mass and viscoelastic properties are less pronounced. When
the polymers return to the contracted state, we observe irrever-
sible changes in all polymers, with more irreversibility for
p(g3T2) (Fig. 4(B)).
It is noteworthy that p(g0T2–g6T2) shows a strong dissipa-
tion drift in the contracted state, indicating that the material
cannot be controlled as reliably as the other polymers. Addi-
tionally, p(g0T2–g6T2) also shows a positive frequency value in
the contracted state, indicating a mass loss with respect to the
pristine state exposed to the electrolyte. This indicates an
immediate passive swelling of the material when it is exposed
to the electrolyte. P(g1T2–g5T2) behaves similarly but to a lower
extent. This passive swelling, however, is absent for p(g4T2)–
(g2T2) and for p(g3T2), indicating that the passive swelling
might be correlated to the longest side chains of p(g0T2–g6T2)
and p(g1T2–g5T2). All the polymers charge to a comparable
extent (Fig. S4, ESI†) and at the same speed (Fig. 4(C)). Accord-
ingly, the mass change driven by anion intake (calculated by
assuming that for each injected hole a Cl anion compensates) is
comparable between the different polymers and the different

electrolytes. On the contrary, the time constant of the mass
change depends both on the side chains and the electrolyte
concentration (Fig. 4(C) and (D)). We compared the mass
change extracted from the charge compensation with that
extracted directly from eQCM-D. Assuming that the mass
change is driven only by water and Cl anions, the difference
between the mass of eQCM-D and the Cl one gives the extra
water loaded in the polymer. For most polymers, the higher the
asymmetry of the side chains the lower the amount of loaded
water (Fig. 4(D)), despite the longer time required to drive the
mass change (Fig. 4(C)). Longer chains possibly need more time
to rearrange.42 For increasing electrolyte concentration, less
water is loaded in the materials, which is reflected in a weaker
softening effect (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†) and a lower volumetric
increase (Fig. S8, ESI†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate that with electrochemical doping
we can modulate the mechanical properties of OMIECs. We
find that p(g3T2) is a soft OMIEC with a Young’s Modulus of
68  8.97 MPa and less than 10 MPa in dry and hydrated states,
respectively. When electrochemically doped the Young’s mod-
ulus of p(g3T2) decreases by more than one order of magni-
tude, and in a reversible manner, reaching a value of 0.4 
0.08 MPa. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
modulation of a OMIEC’s Young’s modulus with electrochemi-
cal doping; however, only a few studies have focused on this
topic.12 We attribute the changes in the mechanical properties
of p(g3T2) to the large volume change that occurs upon doping
of more than 1000%. The change in mechanical properties
depends on the electrolyte concentration used; the more con-
centrated the electrolyte the less the change in mechanical
properties, even if the polymer is doped to the same extent. We
argue that this process is driven by osmosis where in a less
concentrated electrolyte there is a higher ionic gradient
between the charged polymer and the surrounding electrolyte;
hence osmosis drives more water molecules into the bulk of the
polymer. Furthermore, we propose representing the eQCM-D
data in D(F) plots to qualitative assess changes in mass and
softness. While eQCM-D is very powerful for monitoring small
mass changes, extracting quantitative parameters for the vis-
coelastic properties is very challenging50 due to the multipara-
meter fitting. Plotting the frequency change as a function of the
dissipation change facilitates visual assessment of the changes
in mass and viscoelastic properties and comparison of diﬀerent
conditions or materials. In this way, we show that by increasing
the EG-side chain asymmetry in a series of polythiophenes, the
change in mass and viscoelastic properties is less pronounced.
Our study demonstrates that EG-side chain polythiophenes are
promising candidates for mechanical actuators, as, depending
on the applied voltage, the electrolyte composition, and the
side chain functionality, it is possible to deliver diﬀerent
mechanical stimuli on demand. With controllable Young’s
modulus between 0.4 MPa and 11 MPa, a range that is similar
to that of tissues, we expect these materials will be of great
interest for biointerfacing applications.
Materials and methods
Synthesis of glycolated polymers
Glycolated polymers were synthesized as presented before.42
Electrochemical characterization
Fibers were coated in a rotating fashion where the carbon fiber
was slowly pulled out of the polymer solution in chloroform
situated in a glass capillary to reduce the evaporation speed by
reducing the exposed surface. The fibers were mounted in an
enclosed custom setup with the electrolyte in a 3-electrode
configuration with the coated fiber as working, Pt wire as
counter and an Ag/AgCl wire as pseudo reference. The custom
setup was mounted under a stereo microscope (Nikon SMZ1500,
Nikon WD45 lens, Nikon DS-Fi1 camera, Nikon NIS Elements
software) and the volume expansion was monitored, following
an electrochemical stimulation controlled with Metrohm mAuto-
lab Type III and the Autolab Nova 2 software. The polymer
volume was computationally extracted from the micrographs
based on a gray value threshold assuming a cylindrical shape
(Fig. S1, ESI†). Details can be found in previous publications.40
Quartz microbalance characterization
Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation
(eQCM-D) was performed with a QSense Analyzer E4 on gold
coated Quartzes (5 MHz, QSX301). The gold surface served as
the working electrode in a 3-electrode setup with platinum as
the counter electrode, which is part of the eQCM-D chamber,
and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode specific to the device (WPI
Dri-Ref). The electrochemistry was controlled with a potentio-
stat of type Metrohm mAutolab Type III and the Autolab Nova 2
software package. For every sample an eQCM-D baseline in air
and the respective electrolyte was acquired. Then a polymer
film was applied by spin coating (3000 rpm acc., 3000 rpm, 60 s)
with a drop of 50 ml of 2.5 mg ml1 polymer in chloroform. The
polymer coated QCM quartz was mounted in eQCM-D and
baselines in air and electrolyte were acquired again. Finally,
the electrochemical experiment was performed. After the
experiment, the individual sections (baselines and experiment)
were stitched together and the data were fitted using the
QSense DFind software package.
The mass change was extracted using the Sauerbrey equa-
tion. Despite the softness of the material, which is also
expected to get more hydrated (hence even softer) during
electrochemical cycling, the Sauerbrey equation still gives a
good estimate of these parameters since the films are thin.
Electrochemical AFM (EC-AFM)
Electrochemical AFM (EC-AFM) experiments were performed
on a Dimension Icon XR (Bruker). The polymer films were
deposited by spin coating on a gold substrate acting as a
working electrode. These samples were then mounted in an

electrochemical cell connected to a bipotentiostat and filled
with the desired electrolyte. A Pt wire and an Ag wire were used
as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. AFM
imaging was performed in the oﬀ-resonance mode with silicon
nitride probes having a nominal tip radius of 20 nm. The
roughness of the films under diﬀerent conditions was obtained
by averaging the RRMS values measured on diﬀerent regions
(1 mm2 area) of an image. During imaging the applied force was
controlled so as not to exceed a few nN. For elastic modulus
measurements the deflection sensitivity of each probe was
calibrated by repeated indentation on a clean sapphire sub-
strate in 1, 0.1 or 0.01 mM KCl, and the spring constant of the
cantilever was estimated by the thermal noise method. Inden-
tations were performed by bringing the AFM probe in contact
with the sample surface at a controlled load force and recording
force–displacement
curves
during
the
loading–unloading
cycles. Measurements were performed by acquiring 100 force
curves per sample, at a maximum load of 2 nN. The elastic
modulus was obtained by fitting the force curves through a
linearized Hertz model:

where F is the force, d is the sample deformation, E is the
Young’s modulus, n is the Poisson ratio, and R is the radius of
the indenting probe. A Poisson ratio of 0.3 was considered for
all the fittings.
