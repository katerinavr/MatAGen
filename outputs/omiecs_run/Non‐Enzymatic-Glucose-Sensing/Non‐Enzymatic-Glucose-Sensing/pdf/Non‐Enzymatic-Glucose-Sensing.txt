Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) have emerged as
promising materials for biological sensing, owing to their electrochemical
activity, stability in an aqueous environment, and biocompatibility. Yet,
OMIEC-based sensors rely predominantly on the use of composite matrices
to enable stimuli-responsive functionality, which can exhibit issues with
intercomponent interfacing. In this study, an approach is presented for
non-enzymatic glucose detection by harnessing a newly synthesized
functionalized monomer, EDOT-PBA. This monomer integrates electrically
conducting and receptor moieties within a single organic component,
obviating the need for complex composite preparation. By engineering the
conditions for electrodeposition, two distinct polymer ﬁlm architectures are
developed: pristine PEDOT-PBA and molecularly imprinted PEDOT-PBA. Both
architectures demonstrated proﬁcient glucose binding and signal
transduction capabilities. Notably, the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)
architecture demonstrated faster stabilization upon glucose uptake while it
also enabled a lower limit of detection, lower standard deviation, and a
broader linear range in the sensor output signal compared to its
non-imprinted counterpart. This material design not only provides a robust
and eﬃcient platform for glucose detection but also oﬀers a blueprint for
developing selective sensors for a diverse array of target molecules, by tuning
the receptor units correspondingly.

1. Introduction
Glucose, a quintessential hexose sugar, is a
ubiquitous constituent of the human diet
and serves as the major precursor of the
metabolic pathway, providing energy for
higher respiring organisms.[1] The promi-
nence of glucose in the human body, along
with its critical role in metabolism, renders
it a compelling biomarker of interest for
biological sensing. In humans, its normal
concentration in the bloodstream ranges
from 4 to 7 mm.[2] Dysregulation of glu-
cose levels can lead to signiﬁcant health
complications, such as hyperglycaemia[3]
and hypoglycaemia,[4] as well as diabetes
mellitus. Notably, diabetes represents one
of the most prevalent diseases worldwide,
which aﬀected 529 million people world-
wide in 2021, a ﬁgure projected to rise to
1.31 billion by 2050.[5] As of now, there
is no known cure, and its management
necessitates the continuous monitoring of
glucose concentrations in the bloodstream.
Existing commercial methods for mon-
itoring glucose levels in diabetes patients,
and alternatives found in the scientiﬁc

literature, predominantly rely on the use of the glucose oxi-
dase (GOx) enzyme, due to its high speciﬁcity and its capacity
as a redox-active molecule that facilitates straightforward con-
version to an electronic signal. Various organic and inorganic
conducting materials have been integrated with GOx to detect
glucose through diﬀerent transduction mechanisms. Organic
mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) have emerged as
a transducing material promising for chemical sensing, ow-
ing to their electrochemical functionality,[6] stability in an aque-
ous environment,[7] and biocompatibility.[8] The ability to mod-
ify OMIECs at both molecular and macroscopic levels en-
ables a high degree of control over structure-function rela-
tionships. For instance, polar side chains such as oligoethers
can be introduced to facilitate the diﬀusion of hydrated ions
into the bulk material, enhancing the interface with biolog-
ical systems,[9,10] while tailored binding groups can interact
with biological analytes[11] or proteins,[12] and surface wettabil-
ity and porosity can be engineered based on the macromolecu-
lar order and processing techniques.[13–15] OMIECs oﬀer a bio-
compatible interface that facilitates the transduction of elec-
tronic signals during oxidation of glucose by GOx. A partic-
ularly successful material for enzyme-based glucose sensing
is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PE-
DOT:PSS), whose ubiquitous fame in the ﬁeld of bioelectron-
ics is rooted in its commercial availability.[16] Organic electro-
chemical transistors (OECTs) represent an exemplary platform
in which OMIECs such as PEDOT:PSS, combined with GOx as
the sensing material, show an electronic output varying with ex-
posure to various glucose concentrations.[17–22] Recently, n-type
(electron-transporting) OMIECs have been applied as the OECT
channel and gate, exhibiting an abrupt increase in the channel
current upon GOx/glucose reaction and a very low limit of de-
tection in the absence of a redox shuttle.[23,24] However, the use
of enzymes in the development of scalable biological sensor sys-
tems has encountered criticism due to concerns related to pro-
tein instability,[25] gradual leaching over time, sensitivity to fac-
tors such as temperature, humidity, toxic chemicals, ionic deter-
gents and pH,[26] as well as the intricate procedures needed for
enzyme immobilization on surfaces.[27] In addition, reliance on
enzymes hinders the development of adaptable and scalable sys-
tems that can be customized for a broader range of molecular
analytes that may not have readily available or practically feasible
enzymes associated with them.
Consequently, there is growing interest in the exploration
of enzyme-free sensing methods. Glucose sensors have been
demonstrated featuring copper oxides, which catalyze the electro-
oxidation of glucose, in conjunction with high surface area elec-
trode materials such as nanoporous gold,[28] graphene[29] and
carbon nanotubes;[30] and eﬃciency has been further improved
by applying synergistic co-catalysts such as cobalt oxides,[31–34]
used for faster electron transport pathways.[35] Meanwhile, the
reversible binding of boronic acid species to 1,2- and 1,3-diols
has paved the way for their incorporation in materials as the re-
ceptor unit to build enzyme-free sensors. Due to the synthetic
pliability of organic materials, adaptations to the parent struc-
ture allow boronic acids to be applied in a variety of glucose-
sensing frameworks. For example, small molecule bis-boronic
acids have been applied as ﬂuorescent sensors[36] while electro-
chemical approaches include the incorporation of the motif into:
anthracene-based immobilized electrodes;[37] hydrogels whose
permittivity changes upon glucose binding;[38] and ﬁeld-eﬀect
transistors based on copolymer gels[39] or surface-functionalized
single-walled carbon nanotubes.[40]
Despite their promise as synthetically adaptable semicon-
ductors, OMIECs have been under-explored for enzyme-
free sensing. A few examples involve composites such as
Ni(OH)2-functionalized reduced graphene oxide combined with
PEDOT,[41] or PEDOT:PSS combined with phenylboronic acid-
functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogels.[42,43] These studies
demonstrate that enzyme-free glucose detection using OMIECs
is feasible; however, blending diﬀerent components with
OMIECs lead to phase segregation, which necessitates meticu-
lous control of the intercomponent interfaces. Moreover, achiev-
ing both sensitivity and selectivity while maintaining device-to-
device reproducibility remains a challenging task for such com-
posite systems.
To address these challenges and leverage the highly tun-
able structure-function relationship of OMIECs, we here de-
veloped a single active material that combines receptor and
transducer functionalities, in this case, the glucose-binding and
electrically conducting moieties, respectively. We have selected
3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as an electroactive build-
ing block due to its ability to be polymerized electrochemically,
thereby avoiding the use of toxic reagents such as the organ-
otin intermediates often used in the conventional synthesis of
semiconducting polymers, and enabling the direct functional-
ization of the OECT gate electrode.[44] From an organic design
perspective, EDOT is widely considered challenging to modify
synthetically; over the last several years, several research groups
have contributed pioneering approaches to its structural func-
tionalization, often by exploring alternative core designs such as
PheDOT[45] and ProDOT,[46,47] or reﬁning synthetic strategy to in-
troduce pendant functional groups to the bridging ethylenedioxy
moiety.[48–52] Of particular note to this work is the demonstra-
tion of an EDOT species covalently grafted to a phenylboronic
acid moiety using a combination of ﬂexible ether and amide
linkages, ﬁrst presented by Shen et al. in 2018.[53] Huang et al.
demonstrated sensitivity of this material toward glucose when
electrodeposited as the glucose-binding active layer for electro-
chemical sensing procedures, such as quartz crystal microbal-
ance (QCM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),
with a limit of detection of 50 μm by the latter technique.[54]
The monomer was synthesized in three steps from the ex-
pensive hydroxymethyl EDOT building block, EDOT-OH.
[53,55]
We have previously demonstrated a robust methodology for a
shorter and more rigid covalent attachment of analyte-binding
groups to EDOT from the more aﬀordable starting material
3,4-dimethoxythiophene.[56] Here, we harness the same versa-
tile synthetic strategy to develop a scalable phenylboronic acid-
functionalized monomer, EDOT-PBA (Scheme 1). Taking advan-
tage of the strong interaction between EDOT-PBA and hexose
sugars, we explore two approaches to create a functional PEDOT-
PBA ﬁlm as the gate electrode material for the OECT-based sen-
sor. First, we fabricate a PEDOT-PBA ﬁlm through a standard
electropolymerization, which exhibits high sensitivity to glucose
in the range of 10 μm to 10 mm. Second, our rigid monomer de-
sign allows us to introduce a molecular imprinting technique to
electropolymerize an imprinted PEDOT-PBA ﬁlm, resulting in a

posure to glucose.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Synthesis and Characterization
The design approach toward a novel conjugated polymer fea-
turing a pendant boronic acid was adapted from our previous
work[56] modifying EDOT using the Staudinger-Vilarrasa[57,58] re-
action. Demonstrating the versatility of the same building block,
EDOT-N3, herein we introduce 4-bromobenzoic acid to aﬀord
the bromide intermediate EDOT-PBr in good yield, followed by
an adapted Miyaura borylation[59] to give the free boronic acid
EDOT-PBA without requiring a protecting group (Scheme 1). De-
tailed synthetic procedures are provided in the Supporting Infor-
mation.
The corresponding polymer, PEDOT-PBA, was synthesized
using potentiostatic electrodeposition, allowing us to obtain a
thin ﬁlm of PEDOT-PBA at the working electrode. Rather than ex-
ploring diﬀerent deposition conditions (choice of solvent, depo-
sition method and parameters), our approach to judicious nanos-
tructuring of the polymer ﬁlm is instead via the development of
a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) using electropolymer-
ization in the presence of a sugar template (Figure 1). Since
boronic acids are well established to bind a range of 1,2- and
1,3-diols,[60] we investigate whether the MIP framework may
be used to improve selectivity toward a speciﬁc sugar, glucose.
The framework of a MIP consists of a porous, 3D polymer ma-
trix that contains size- and shape-speciﬁc cavities for the ana-
lyte as a result of polymerization with the template analyte in
situ. While classical MIPs are aliphatic and can be featured as
receptors in multi-component sensor devices, such as those for
glucose,[61–63] it is possible to create these systems in conjunc-
tion with a semiconducting material as the backbone,[64–66] com-
bining receptor and transducer into one component to enable in-
corporation as the active layer in an electrochemical device. An
important consideration for MIP fabrication is the rigidity of the
resulting framework, which ensures the retention of cavity shape
and size upon template removal. In classical (non-conjugated)
MIPs, this is usually achieved by the addition of a cross-linker.[67]
However, many examples in the literature of selective recogni-
tion via templated polymerization of conjugated materials, self-
described as “molecularly-imprinted”, omit the cross-linker from
their composition,[64,66,68–71] as rigidity can be conferred from
the backbone of the conjugated material.[65] With this in mind,
our synthetic design features a short, conformationally restrictive
phenyl/amide bridging linkage between glucose-binding boronic
acid and electropolymerizable EDOT moieties.
While MIPs templated from glucose have been incorporated
into a variety of composite devices to act as selective sensors for

the same material,[63,72–75] here, we employ a methylated ana-
logue of glucose, methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside, which has prece-
dent in this application for glucose sensing,[76] and has additional
beneﬁts such as solubility in acetonitrile for deposition, and re-
ducing uncertainty in the measurement of the analyte concentra-
tion as a result of template leakage.[77–79]
While glucose-boronic acid binding is well-established in an
aqueous environment at a basic pH,[80,81] it was important in this
case to conﬁrm that EDOT-PBA:template binding occurs within
the organic medium used for polymer deposition, speciﬁcally,
acetonitrile, before it could be used as the templated system.
Note that methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside is not soluble in acetoni-
trile up to 5 mM in isolation or alongside unmodiﬁed EDOT.
However, it is fully soluble at this concentration in the pres-
ence of the EDOT-PBA binding monomer, allowing the elec-
trodeposition of uniform polymer ﬁlms to occur (Figure S1, Sup-
porting Information). Shielding of the polar hydroxyl groups on
the sugar may, therefore, be occurring as a result of the bind-
ing interactions with the boronic acid moiety of EDOT-PBA.
To investigate this, equimolar or 2:1 molar solutions of EDOT-
PBA and methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside were prepared in deuter-
ated acetonitrile and examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. A de-
tailed analysis of the results, given in the Supporting Informa-
tion, demonstrates that a clear binding interaction is occurring
between EDOT-PBA and methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside in acetoni-
trile, evidenced by features such as the quenching of free boronic
acid protons at 6.15 ppm in the presence of the template (Figure
S3, Supporting Information) as well as the change in chemical
shift to several proton environments on the sugar in the presence
of the monomer (Figures S2 and S4, Supporting Information).
Another important step in MIP fabrication is the removal of the
template from the matrix to create analyte-speciﬁc cavities. Since
the binding of the boronic acids with sugars is pH-dependent,
methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside can be removed under acidic condi-
tions. Based on previous work, this was achieved by submersion
in 1:1 MeOH:50 mm HCl (aq.) for 30 min with gentle stirring
followed by 10 min in deionized water.[82]
With all of the aforementioned parameters in mind, the proce-
dure for electrodeposition can be summarized as follows: for the
non-imprinted polymer (NIP), a voltage of +1.2 V was applied
to a 10 mm solution of the monomer in acetonitrile, alongside
0.1 m tetrabutylammonium perchlorate electrolyte, in a three-
electrode setup with Ag/AgNO3 reference and Pt counter elec-
trodes. For the MIP, the procedure is identical with the additional
presence of 5 mm methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside, and is followed
by the washing step detailed above (Figure 1). The type of work-
ing electrode, which becomes the substrate for the polymer ﬁlm,
can be selected based on intended application. Here, we use in-
dium tin oxide (ITO)-glass, a Ti-Au-coated piezoelectric sensor, or
Cr-Au on either polyimide, glass or Si where appropriate for UV–
vis, QCM-D, electrochemical measurements, OECT, and scan-
ning electron microscopy respectively.
2.2. High-Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy
To conﬁrm the morphological diﬀerences between the diﬀer-
ing polymer architectures, high-resolution scanning electron
microscopy (HRSEM) was conducted on thin ﬁlms of the fol-
lowing: NIP, templated MIP (unwashed; template present),
and washed MIP (template removed). The top-view images in
Figure 2 reveal that all ﬁlms exhibit particle-aggregate pillars
on the ﬁlm surface, with a less dense morphology observed for
the imprinted polymer. Examining the cross section, we note
that the templated and washed MIP ﬁlms (Figure 2b,c) display
superior uniformity compared to the NIP ﬁlms (Figure 2a).

with 5 mm methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside, before washing; c) MIP templated with 5 mm methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside then washed with 1:1 MeOH:50 mm
HCl (aq.) for 30 min. All scale bars are 400 nm.
We note that the washing step of the MIP results in reduced
surface roughness, which corresponds to a reduction in particle-
aggregate size; the resultant smoothing and thinning of the
ﬁlm upon washing can be visualized clearly in the cross section
images. It also appears that the MIP ﬁlm somewhat contracts
during the washing step. We, therefore, speculate that further
improvements in the PEDOT-PBA MIP sensing platform could
be achieved through a more rigorous control of the MIP archi-
tecture and its structural robustness. Moreover, to investigate
the structural features of these ﬁlm architectures, we carried out
the spectroelectrochemical analysis of thin ﬁlms of PEDOT-PBA
deposited onto ITO-coated glass. The results, detailed in Figures
S5 and S6 (Supporting Information), indicate more disordered
polymer backbone conformations for the MIP ﬁlm, compared to
the corresponding NIP ﬁlm, likely a result of the non-covalent
template incorporation during the electrodeposition.
2.3. Electrochemical Properties
We ﬁrst characterized the electrochemical behavior of the
PEDOT-PBA ﬁlms polymerized on Au substrates using cyclic
voltammetry (CV) and EIS. The cyclic voltammogram of the
PEDOT-PBA (NIP) electrode in phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS)
reveals characteristics of pseudocapacitive behavior with oxida-
tion (forward scan) and reduction (reverse scan) peaks, whereas
the CV curve of the imprinted PEDOT-PBA (MIP) exhibits a
more rectangular shape, indicating a more capacitive behavior.
Next, CV curves were recorded for the NIP and MIP-coated elec-
trodes, which had been incubated in PBS containing glucose for
1 min, with this experiment subsequently repeated with increas-
ing glucose concentrations from 100 μm to 5 mm. As glucose con-
centration increased (Figure 3a,b), the area under the CV curves
for both polymer electrodes decreased. This observation suggests
that the binding of glucose to the PBA units within the poly-
mer ﬁlms reduces their capacitance. Notably, our previous study
demonstrated that a similar PEDOT ﬁlm that lacks the PBA unit
did not respond to the addition of glucose in PBS, emphasiz-
ing the essential role of PBA units in glucose interaction and
its subsequent impact on the electrochemical properties of the
polymers.[42]
A similar conclusion can be reached by analyzing the electro-
chemical impedance spectra of the ﬁlms. The Nyquist plots in
Figure 3c,d show changes that scale with the increase in glucose
concentrations, particularly at the low frequency (0.1 to 1 Hz)
regime, for both ﬁlms. We used electrical circuit models, shown
in Figure S7 (Supporting Information), to analyze these spectra
and found that both ﬁlms show a capacitance decrease upon glu-
cose incubation (Table S1, Supporting Information). Note, how-
ever, that a quantitative comparison between the two ﬁlms could
not be made as two diﬀerent models had to be used for a reason-
able ﬁt quality. The reduction in capacitance, as deduced from
CV and EIS analysis, can be attributed to the PEDOT structure
becoming more compact upon binding of glucose molecules to
PBA units, restricting the movement of ions within the ﬁlm.
2.4. Transistor Characterization
While the ﬁlms show small changes to their electrochemical
properties by CV and EIS upon glucose-PBA complexation, the
molecular design of PEDOT-PBA leads to a further advantage.
The ability to electropolymerize (with or without molecular im-
printing) while retaining semiconducting behavior in an aque-
ous environment enables the application of the NIP and MIP di-
rectly as gate materials in the OECT conﬁguration. OECTs, ow-
ing to their high transconductance (gm) feature, are eﬀective at
the transduction of weak voltage ﬂuctuations, associated with bi-
ological events occurring in an aqueous medium in the vicinity
of the gate electrode, into large current signals.[23,83] The OECT
can therefore be used to monitor polymer-target interactions in
a simulated biological environment. Figure 4a illustrates the in-
vestigated OECT device structure, featuring a PEDOT:PSS chan-
nel gated by the PEDOT-PBA electrode. In this device conﬁgu-
ration, we are using the OECT as a transconductance ampliﬁer:
the formation of the PBA-glucose complex at the gate electrode
is envisaged to alter the capacitance of the gate electrode, which
will be translated into changes in the channel current. The sepa-
ration of the gate electrode from the channel allows us to reuse
the channel with various gate electrodes that can be disposed. In
this conﬁguration, only the gate electrode is exposed to the ana-
lyte solution, while the channel can be operated many times. The

gate electrode could also be fabricated next to the channel, in this
case, we expect the sensor performance to be even higher by use
of microﬂuidics.[84]
We ﬁrst assessed the performance of the NIP and MIP as
the gate electrode and found that both can eﬀectively modulate
the PEDOT:PSS channel (Figure 4b; Figure S8, Supporting In-
formation). Figure 4c,d presents the steady-state performance of
the OECT with NIP-gated electrodes after exposure to glucose or
fructose solutions at varying concentrations. The transfer curves
of the OECT reveal a consistent reduction in the source-drain cur-
rent (ID) as the glucose concentration increases (Figure 4c). In
contrast, the changes are minimal when the gate is exposed to
fructose (Figure 4d). Figure S8 (Supporting Information) shows
the same data extracted from the experiments performed with
the MIP-gated OECT. Glucose binding lowers the capacitance
of PEDOT-PBA gate electrodes, hence their capability to dope
and dedope the channel. Therefore, we observe a smaller IDS
at all gate voltages at diﬀerent polarities upon glucose binding.
Figure 4e,f depicts the calibration curve for the OECT biosensors,
with the normalized response (NR) value calculated from the
variations in ID in response to analyte concentrations that range
from 100 μm to 10 mm. Both NIP and MIP gate electrodes exhibit
a much higher response to glucose than to fructose, indicative of
the preferential binding of PBA to glucose. The statistical data
of the high R2 value and the linear equation of the calibration
plots are shown in Table S2 (Supporting Information), indicating
a high degree of linearity and thus a good correlation between
the sensor output and glucose concentrations within the tested
range. Limit of detection (LOD) values were extracted from this
analysis using the formula LOD = 3.3 × (𝜎/S), where 𝜎represents
the standard deviation of the y-intercept, and S is the slope of the
calibration curve. The resulting LOD values are 28.2 and 22.3 μm
for the NIP and MIP respectively, which are among the lowest of
recent non-enzymatic, PBA-based electrochemical glucose sen-
sors (Table S3, Supporting Information). We conducted a speci-
ﬁcity test and recorded the device current change in response
to other common interferents or abundant molecules in serum,
such as lactate, cholesterol, and human serum albumin (Figure
S9a, Supporting Information). These species generated a change
in MIP-based-OECT current. However, the magnitude of the in-
terfering signal was much lower than compared to the sensor’s
response to glucose. In addition, the MIP sensors also success-
fully detected glucose contained in the commercial serum sam-
ple as well as the additional spiked amount of glucose, indicating
the sensor’s capability in complex biological conditions (Figure
S9b, Supporting Information). We also conducted a series of ex-
periments that evaluated the sensor performance when the gate
was exposed to target solutions at diﬀerent ionic strengths, pH
levels, or temperatures. The results are summarized in Figure
S10a–c (Supporting Information) and indicate that the MIP ﬁlm
maintains its sensitivity to glucose under diﬀerent environmen-
tal conditions. While the NR values changed, the sensitivity

Figure 4. The OECT biosensor conﬁguration and characteristics. a) The PEDOT-PBA functionalized Au electrode is used as the gate electrode of the
OECT with a PEDOT:PSS ﬁlm in the channel. The channel has a width of 10 μm and length of 100 μm and the gate electrode is 2 mm × 2 mm. The
complexation of the PBA unit with glucose molecules occurs at the gate electrode, decreasing the capacitance of the gate electrode, thereby modulating
the OECT conductance. The measurement and analyte solution is 1X PBS. b) The output characteristics of the OECT with the NIP electrode as the gate.

remained similar at higher temperatures or lower ionic strength
conditions. A lower pH (6) somewhat aﬀected the dynamic range,
and overall, under these conditions, the sensor maintained its
sensitivity, suggesting the stability of the ﬁlm.
Although the NIP gate electrode shows a higher NR value com-
pared to the MIP gate electrode, further analysis of the data re-
veals advantages oﬀered by the MIP electrodes: i) A reduced limit
of detection. ii) A signiﬁcantly smaller standard deviation, indi-
cating better reproducibility among diﬀerent electrode batches.
iii) A single linear response within a broad range of glucose con-
centrations (10 μm to 10 mm), with a sensitivity slope of −0.03, as
opposed to the NIP electrode’s two linear regions (with a slope
of −0.17 for 10 to 100 μm and −0.05 for 100 μm to 10 mm),
which suggests a more straightforward analysis in a broader de-
tection range. Despite the lower NR, the smaller standard de-
viation and linear change in current especially at high glucose
concentrations make MIP superior to NIP. For MIP sensors, it
is possible to assign each current reading to one glucose level,
whereas for NIP above 10−4 m, it is challenging to estimate glu-
cose concentrations. These results underscore the capability of
a single-component PEDOT-PBA electrode, whether in the form
of our NIP or MIP architecture, to selectively capture the glucose
molecules and function in OECT biosensing platforms. The in-
tegration of the PEDOT-PBA electrode into the OECT oﬀers an
ampliﬁed response compared to a three-electrode system, and
it holds the potential for further development into miniaturized
and integrated sensors.
2.5. QCM-D Analysis of the Speed and Amount of Glucose
Uptake
We used the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation moni-
toring (QCM-D) technique to dynamically observe the real-time
formation of both NIP and MIP ﬁlms. QCM-D is a non-invasive
gravimetric approach for tracking adsorption and desorption pro-
cesses on ﬁlm-coated quartz crystal sensors. Figure 5a,b presents
the raw QCM-D proﬁles, illustrating the dynamic changes in fre-
quency and dissipation signals before and after the in situ elec-
trochemical polymerization of the NIP ﬁlm on the quartz crystal
sensor. Using the Sauerbrey equation, we translated the change
in frequency into deposited mass, revealing that 12 618 ng cm−2
of NIP ﬁlm was generated during electropolymerization under
our speciﬁc fabrication conditions (1.2 V for 45 s) (Figure 5c).
The simultaneous increase in dissipation signal (Figure 5b) in-
dicates a softening of the QCM-D sensor, highlighting the in-
herent soft nature of deposited polymer ﬁlms. The polymeriza-
tion of MIP resulted in a lower deposited mass of 8294 ng cm−2,

which subsequently experienced a mass loss of ≈306 ng cm−2
following the washing step. This decrease in mass upon wash-
ing indicated the successful removal of the glucose template
(methyl 𝛼-D-glucopyranoside) from the polymer matrix. It is
worth noting that the lighter MIP deposited under the same con-
ditions as the NIP could be attributed to the presence of the
nonconducting glucose template during the polymerization pro-
cess. This presence likely resulted in lower polymer yields and,
hence, fewer available PBA units within the polymer matrix. The
reduction in the number of active binding sites may explain
the lower NR observed for PEDOT-PBA MIP compared to the
NIP.
The QCM-D analysis was used to monitor the interaction of
glucose with NIP and MIP ﬁlms (insets of Figure 5c,d). When
glucose was introduced into the polymer ﬁlms, a decrease in fre-
quency was detected. The magnitude of this frequency reduc-
tion increased as we incubated the ﬁlms with increasing glucose
concentrations. The increase in ﬁlm mass is primarily attributed
to glucose uptake, facilitating the formation of the glucose-PBA
complex within the polymer matrix. Our calculations indicated
that an additional mass of 79 and 48 ng cm−2 were adsorbed when
a 10 mm glucose solution was introduced to the NIP and MIP
ﬁlms, respectively, assuming that the entire adsorbed mass was
linked to the glucose-PBA complex. Despite the lower amount of
glucose uptake in the MIP ﬁlm, which we relate to fewer acces-
sible binding sites, this ﬁlm achieved faster signal stabilization
during incubation with glucose. The faster and more stable sig-

nal may also be associated with the smaller standard deviation
observed among the MIP sensors. In summary, the QCM-D re-
sults revealed that the EDOT-PBA monomers were successfully
polymerized in the form of NIP and MIP ﬁlms, with both ﬁlms
interacting with glucose molecules. The QCM-D also suggests
that the fabrication method of the MIP ﬁlm could be further op-
timized, such as by using diﬀerent cross-linker structures as well
as a variety of electrochemical deposition conditions to achieve
a thicker and more rigid deposited polymer ﬁlm with a higher
number of PBA units, potentially enhancing the binding capac-
ity of the MIP sensor.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we present a non-enzymatic glucose detection plat-
form using a newly synthesized functionalized monomer, EDOT-
PBA. This monomer features a simple yet eﬀective synthetic

design by combining electrically conducting moieties and re-
ceptor units in a single component without the need for further
chemical conjugation. The electrodeposition technique was
successfully demonstrated to produce functionalized polymer
ﬁlms using two scenarios, i) pristine PEDOT-PBA (NIP), and
ii) imprinted PEDOT-PBA (MIP). Both functionalized polymer
architectures are shown to eﬀectively enable glucose binding and
signal transduction, as demonstrated through various methods
including CV, EIS, OECT, and QCM-D. The incorporation of the
molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) architecture introduced
several advantageous features compared to the non-imprinted
counterpart, such as enhanced ﬁlm uniformity, as observed by
high-resolution SEM, which signiﬁcantly improves the repro-
ducibility in the NR response, as indicated by a very low standard
deviation of OECT output signal. Additionally, the MIP ﬁlm
results in a lower limit of detection, faster stabilization upon
glucose uptake, and broader linear response, as indicated by
QCM-D and single sensitivity response in the range of 10 μm
to 10 mm. We anticipate that further improvements of the MIP
sensing platform can be achieved by carefully increasing the
structural robustness of the polymer ﬁlm without signiﬁcantly
compromising the ﬂexibility required to create template-speciﬁc
cavities. This could be achieved for instance using structurally
similar cross-linkers to prevent the observed change in mi-
crostructure upon template removal. We furthermore notice the
modularity of the system; tailoring toward glucose sensing was
achieved through the choice of template, meaning that other
polar biomarkers could be targeted with the same system solely
by changing the template molecule. In conclusion, this versatile
and adaptable synthetic design framework holds great promise
for further optimization and broader application to a wide range
of other analytes.
4. Experimental Section
Materials:
Unless otherwise stated, all chemical synthesis was car-
ried out using commercially available reagents, used as supplied from
Sigma Aldrich, Acros Organics, Alfa Aesar, or Fluorochem, in combi-
nation with solvents from Honeywell. Anhydrous solvents were pur-
chased from Acros Organics or collected from an MBRAUN MB SPS-
800 solvent puriﬁcation system. 3,4-Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), (3-
glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS), sodium dodecylbenzenesul-
fonate (DBSA), ethylene glycol (EG), d-(+)-glucose, d-(+)-fructose, and
1X phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and utilized without any further modiﬁcation. 1X PBS (pH 7.4) solution
contains 137.9 mm sodium chloride (NaCl), 2.7 mm potassium chloride
(KCl), 1.5 mm potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4), and 8.1 mm
sodium phosphate dibasic (Na2HPO4) anhydrous. All aqueous solutions
were prepared using ultrapure water from Millipore Milli-Q. Solutions of
glucose and fructose with varying concentrations were prepared in PBS.
The channel of OECTs was fabricated from a dispersion of PEDOT:PSS
(PH1000, Heraeus) incorporating GOPS, DBSA, and EG.
Synthesis:
Where it was indicated that anhydrous conditions were
used, reactions were carried out in a sealed environment under a nitro-
gen atmosphere, using glassware oven-dried at 120 °C overnight. Ana-
lytical thin layer chromatography was carried out on Merck Kieselgel 60
aluminum-backed silica plates, with visualization using short-wave ultra-
violet light, or a potassium permanganate or phosphomolybdic acid stain
where appropriate. Column chromatography was carried out using VWR
silica gel (40–60 μm). Full synthetic procedures and characterization for
EDOT-PBA are detailed in the Supporting Information.
Fabrication of the PEDOT-PBA Films:
The synthesis of PEDOT-PBA
was conducted using electrochemical polymerization in an organic sol-
vent (acetonitrile) at a constant voltage (potentiostatic mode). Two dif-
ferent pre-monomer dispersions were prepared for this study, i) pristine
EDOT-PBA (referred to as Non-Imprinted Polymer, NIP), and ii) EDOT-
PBA mixed with glucose template (referred to as Molecularly Imprinted
Polymer, MIP). A detailed composition of each dispersion is shown in
Table 1. The monomer dispersion was placed into the electrochemical
cell in a three-electrode conﬁguration using a Pt counter electrode, an
Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode for organic solvent, and Au working elec-
trode. The choice of substrate for the working electrode varies depending
on the speciﬁc measurements being conducted, for instance, Cr-Au-coated
Kapton was used for electrochemical measurement and the gate electrode
of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), while ITO-coated glass
was used for UV–vis spectroscopy, and a Ti-Au-coated piezoelectric sen-
sor was used for Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring
(QCM-D). The electrochemical polymerization was performed at a voltage
of +1.2 V for a duration of 45 s. Following the process of electropolymer-
ization, the coated electrodes were rinsed using deionized (DI) water in
order to remove any excess unreacted molecules and then dried with N2
gas spray.
Electrochemical and Spectroelectrochemical Measurements:
The elec-
trochemical properties of the PEDOT-PBA electrodes were evaluated us-
ing cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) techniques. These analyses were conducted in a standard electro-
chemical cell equipped with Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt counter elec-
trode, and a potentiostat (Autolab PGstat128N, MetroOhm). The electro-
chemical measurements were conducted within a cell that was placed in-
side a grounded Faraday cage. The electrolyte used in the experiment was
PBS, and the samples with diﬀerent concentrations of glucose or fructose
(100 μm to 5 mm) were also prepared in PBS for sample incubation. The CV
curves were acquired by sweeping the potential between −0.2 and 0.4 V
versus Ag/AgCl with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The impedance spectra
were recorded at a DC voltage of 0 V versus open circuit potential and an
AC modulation of 10 mV over a frequency range of 0.1–100,000 Hz. Each
measurement was performed in PBS electrolyte following consecutive in-
cubations with increasing concentrations of glucose solutions.
Spectroelectrochemical measurements were carried out in 1X PBS
using a PalmSens EmStat3+ potentiostat alongside a Shimadzu UV-
3600 Plus UV–Vis–NIR Spectrophotometer. Working electrodes were ITO-
coated glass purchased from VisionTek Systems (20 mm × 20 mm),
cleaned with detergent followed by sonication in H2O (3 × 15 min), ace-
tone (2 × 10 min), and isopropyl alcohol (2 × 5 min), followed by plasma
cleaning using Harrick PDC-32G-2 for 5 min directly before use. Counter
electrodes were Pt wire, reference electrodes were Ag/AgCl in H2O for
aqueous systems, all from BASi. Samples for HRSEM were deposited on
20 mm × 10 mm highly doped++ 525 μm Si coated with 10 nm/100 nm
Cr/Au.
OECT Fabrication and Glucose Sensing Measurements:
The OECTs were
fabricated using standard photolithography as described in the previous
work.[42] The width (W) of the OECT channel is 100 μm, while its length
(L) is 10 μm. PEDOT:PSS (PH 1000) was mixed with EG (5 vol%), DBSA
(0.002 vol%), and GOPS (1 wt%) and sonicated for 30 min. The disper-
sion was then ﬁltered through 0.45 μm glass ﬁber ﬁlters and was subse-
quently spin-coated on the channel at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Following the
spin-coating process, the Parylene-C, which served as a sacriﬁcial layer,
was peeled oﬀ, and the ﬁlms were annealed at 140 °C for 1 h under am-
bient conditions. The Au gate electrode was coated with electropolymer-
ized PEDOT-PBA identically, as described above. All measurements were
performed in the top gate electrode conﬁguration and 1X PBS as the elec-
trolyte. The steady-state characteristics of the OECT (output and transfer
curves) were recorded using a Keithley 2612A with customized LabVIEW
software. For sensing measurements, the NIP and MIP-coated electrodes
were incubated in PBS solution containing glucose for 1 min followed by
rinsing in PBS and measured the corresponding IV characteristics. This ex-
periment subsequently repeated with increasing glucose concentrations.
The normalized response of OECT channel current was calculated using

Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D):
QCM-D measurements were performed using a Q-sense analyzer (model
QE401, manufactured by Biolin Scientiﬁc). PEDOT-PBA ﬁlms were elec-
tropolymerized in situ on QCM-D crystals using a potentiostat (Palm-
Sens) coupled with Q-sense electrochemistry module. The three-electrode
conﬁguration consisted of Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt counter elec-
trode, and the QCM-D sensor serving as the working electrode. The mea-
surements were carried out at 24 °C utilizing a peristaltic pump to con-
trol the ﬂow rate at 20 μL min−1 for electropolymerization process and
at 100 μL min−1 for glucose sensing. Following the stabilization of QCM-
D signals in PBS, aliquots of glucose solutions were introduced into the
chamber and the subsequent glucose absorption was observed by moni-
toring changes in frequency (Δf). The Sauerbrey equation (Equation (2))
was used to quantify the change in mass (Δm) on the sensor resulting
from glucose uptake,
Δm = −17.7

where n represents the chosen overtone for the calculations (in this case,
n = 7), while the constant value of −17.7 is derived from the resonant
frequency, active area, density, and shear modulus of the piezoelectrically
active quartz crystal.
