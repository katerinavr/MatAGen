Four glycolated polythiophene-based organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors
(OMIECs), PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT are prepared by atom-eﬃcient
direct arylation polymerization, avoiding the need for toxic organometallic pre-
cursors. PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT are operable in p-type accumulation mode
organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), with PT2gT displaying the best
device performance with a μC* product ﬁgure-of-merit of 290 F cm−1 V−1 s−1.
A record volumetric capacitance among p-type glycolated polythiophene
OMIECs of 313 F cm−3 is observed for PE2gT, ascribed to the high proportion-
ality of polar components in its materials design. The good OECT performance
of PE2gT with μC* = 84.2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1, comparable with state-of-the-art
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
devices, coupled with its synthetic accessibility and favorable accumulation
mode operation makes PE2gT an ideal glycolated alternative to PEDOT:PSS in
bioelectronics. PE2gT with the least negative threshold voltage also displays
the best OECT operational cycling stability, linked to better resistance of
its oxidized state against parasitic redox side reactions . Shelf life stability of
OECTs stored (without bias) is observed to be better for materials with a more
negative threshold voltage and higher average molecular weight (PT2gT),
that are less susceptible to ambient auto-oxidation and ﬁlm delamination.

1. Introduction
Contrasting against the traditional solid-
state electronics that operate predomi-
nantly within the realm of electrons, sig-
nal processing in biology employs the
concurrent movement of both charges
and ions within an aqueous electrolytic
environment, giving rise to functional
incompatibilities between the two.[1] In
order to achieve electronics that inter-
face more eﬀectively with biology, re-
cent research eﬀorts have focussed on
the development of bioelectronics, that
exploit the mixed conductivity of or-
ganic mixed ionic-electronic conductors
(OMIECs) to perform signal processing,
with potential applications encompass-
ing biosensing, integrated healthcare de-
vices and neuromorphic computing.[2,3]
Within bioelectronics, the organic elec-
trochemical transistor (OECT) is the
foundational device, that continues to
garner signiﬁcant research attention in

materials development, device optimization, and applications
in biosensing.[4–11] Unlike organic ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors which
are gated via a dielectric medium, the modulation of charge-
carrying polarons (and bipolarons) throughout the OMIEC
active channel of an OECT is achieved through its gate potential
induced electrochemical oxidation and reduction, entailing the
stoichiometric and volumetric penetration of counterions into
the channel material.[12]
OECT operation is often characterized according to Bernard
and Malliaras’ model, which applies orthogonal ionic and elec-
tronic circuits to describe the concurrent movement of both
charges and ions within a device.[13] The OECT transcon-
ductance, a key ﬁgure-of-merit, is derived from Bernard and
Malliaras’ model to be proportional to the product of active
layer volumetric capacitance and charge mobility (μC*). OECTs
can be operated in either accumulation or depletion mode, de-
pending on the electrochemical properties of the active OMIEC
material.[14] Accumulation mode OECTs employ OMIECs that
have negligible charge carriers in the absence of a gate bias and
grow upon increased biasing. Depletion mode devices use mate-
rials with suﬃcient charge carriers to engender intrinsic conduc-
tivity, that are depleted through biasing. As OMIECs for depletion
mode OECTs are inherently conductive under no gate bias, such
devices exhibit higher power consumption, owing to the need for
continuously applied gate voltage in order to access and maintain
their OFF state.[15] The need for bias to turn devices OFF also
contributes to the lower operational stability of depletion mode
OECTs in comparison with accumulation mode devices, as bias-
ing to access the OFF state invites the negative impacts of para-
sitic redox side reactions with water and oxygen.[16–18]
Despite
its

proﬁle,
poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT, most commonly obtained
as a water-dispersible two-component blend with anionic
poly(styrenesulfonate), i.e., PEDOT:PSS) remains a well-known
and popular selection for bioelectronics research in the anodic
regime (i.e., p-type).[19] Numerous studies exist that probe the
eﬀects of thin ﬁlm crosslinking, crystallinity, and morphology
on device performance and stability.[19–23] To combat electro-
chemical instability, PEDOT:PSS can be de-doped by reaction
with excess alkylamines, to aﬀord neutral PEDOT:PSS that can
be operated as an accumulation mode OECT.[18] Biocomposite
PEDOT blends with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) counteranions
have also been developed, with the aim of creating a less acidic
and more biocompatible OMIEC.[24] The popularity of PEDOT
can (at least in part) be attributed to its ease of synthesis and
availability. Commercial PEDOT:PSS is made by the oxida-
tive polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in
the presence of PSS, whilst electropolymerization of EDOT
can also be performed to create OECT channels of tunable
characteristics.[25,26]
Building on the success of PEDOT, there has been re-
cent growth in the materials design of single-component
polythiophene-based p-type OMIECs for OECTs.[27–31] Single-

In order to engender ionic conductivity into a single-component
organic semiconductor, polar sidechains are incorporated.
Earlier studies mostly focussed on the attachment of ionic
sidechains, to create conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs).[33–36]
However, much like PEDOT:PSS itself, these CPEs often exhibit
aqueous solubility, necessitating the application of performance-
diminishing crosslinkers in their OECT channels.[6,33,37] As
such, research attention shifted towards developing polythio-
phenes with oligomeric ethylene glycol sidechains, that enable
ion conduction without conferring aqueous solubility.[38] Seeded
from the seminal studies by Giovannitti et al. and Nielsen et al.
that describe P(g2T-TT) and P(g2T-T) respectively,[39,40] there
is now an expanding library of high-performance p-type glyco-
lated polythiophene based OMIECs. Materials design studies
have explored modiﬁcations to both sidechain and backbone
conﬁguration, for example in altering sidechain distribution,[41]
adopting propylene and butylene glycol substitutes,[42] as well as
incorporating the cyclopentadithiophene unit,[43] to attain OECT
μC* product performances of 322, 342 and 370 F cm−1 V−1 s−1
respectively. However, most of these glycolated polythiophenes
require multistep syntheses employing Stille polymerization,
which is undesirable from both an upscaling and toxicity point
of view.
Drawing inspiration from the high OECT performances at-
tainable with glycolated polythiophenes, as well as the preva-
lence of PEDOT in bioelectronics, we designed a set of glycolated
polythiophene-based OMIECs with systematic change in their
materials design by the co-polymerization of either thiophene (T)
or the more electron rich EDOT (E), with doubly glycolated co-
monomers based on thiophene (2gT) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene
(2gTT). The incorporation of two triethylene glycol sidechains
in 2gT and 2gTT aims to facilitate the volumetric penetration of
counterions into ﬁlms of resulting co-polymers, without confer-
ring undesirable aqueous solubility and causing undue compro-
mise to electronic charge conduction pathways. Designed vari-
ability of the proportion of polar glycol sidechains (and ethylene-
dioxy bridges) in each polymeric repeat unit was expected to lead
to diverse volumetric capacitances and swelling characteristics
that can also impact OECT performance.
The resulting PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT materials
were synthesized according to a streamlined scheme employing
atom-eﬃcient direct arylation polymerizations that also circum-
vents the need for toxic organometallic precursors. Electrochem-
istry revealed onsets of oxidation at −0.5, −0.7, −0.2, and 0.3 V
versus Ag/AgCl for PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT respec-
tively. PT2gT displayed the overall champion accumulation mode
OECT performance with a μC* product ﬁgure-of-merit of 290
F cm−1 V−1 s−1, ascribed to its high degree of polymerization that
enable its superior charge mobility at 1.00 cm2 V−1 s−1. PE2gT
exhibited a record volumetric capacitance among p-type glyco-
lated polythiophene OMIECs of 313 F cm−3, attributed to the
high proportion of polar glycol and ethylenedioxy components
in its materials design. The good OECT performance of PE2gT,
with a μC* ﬁgure-of-merit of 84.2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 that is compa-
rable with state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS devices, coupled with its
synthetic accessibility and favorable intrinsic accumulation mode
operation makes PE2gT a suitable glycolated alternative to PE-
DOT:PSS in bioelectronics. PE2gT with the least negative thresh-
old voltage also displayed the best OECT cycling performance,
owing to better resistance of its oxidized state against redox side
reactions with products of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),
whilst shelf life stability was found to be best for PT2gT with the

PE2gTT,

PT2gTT, and PT2gT (Scheme 1), were conducted in ligand-free
conditions similar to that reported previously by Sommer and
coworkers,[44–46] circumventing the need for synthetic conversion
of monomers to toxic organometallic polymerization precursors.
Crude polymers were puriﬁed by sequential washings with hot
solvent to remove impurities and low-weight material. Following
reprecipitation, PE2gT, and PT2gT were obtained in excellent
yields of 80% and 76% respectively, whereas yields of thienoth-
iophene incorporating PE2gTT and PT2gTT were signiﬁcantly
lower at 30% and 28%. Attempts at improving the yield of
PE2gTT and PT2gTT by switching from dimethylacetamide
to aromatic solvents (i.e., chlorobenzene and toluene),[47,48]
increasing reaction temperature as well as the incorporation
of the tri(o-anisole) phosphine ligand[49] proved unsuccessful,
resulting in poor solubility of polymers, crosslinked products,
and extremely low weight oligomeric species respectively.
The structural identities of PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and
PT2gT were conﬁrmed through a combination of hot 1H NMR
at 65 °C as well as the fragmental analysis of their matrix-
assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry
traces (Figures S1–S8, Supporting Information). Interpretation
of PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT IR spectra were com-
plicated by the overpowering presence of glycol sidechain sig-
nals (Figure S9, Supporting Information). However, for PT2gTT
and PT2gT a signal at 3040 cm−1 was seen and assigned to C-
H stretching on the 3- and 4- positions of the unsubstituted
thiophene present in the repeating unit of both materials. No
signal near 3040 cm−1 was seen for PE2gTT and PE2gT fea-
turing 3,4-disubstituted EDOT in place of unsubstituted thio-
phene. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was applied to
probe the macromolecular sizes of all four polymers (Table 1;
Figures S10–S13, Supporting Information), revealing a Mn/Ð of
11 KDa/2.0 and 50 KDa/3.8 for PT2gTT and PT2gT respectively,
against polystyrene standards. Analysis of PE2gTT and PE2gT
molecular weights by GPC was complicated by their tendency
to aggregate in solution (owing to backbone auto-oxidation in
air), with examination of UV detector responses suggesting an
unrealistically broad Mn/Ð of 3.1 KDa/31 and 4.1 KDa/34 for

PE2gTT and PE2gT respectively. Integration analysis of their hot
1H NMRs indicated average molecular weights of 3.0 and 3.6 KDa
for PE2gTT and PE2gT respectively, conﬁrming their low de-
gree of polymerization, equivalent to an average chain length
of ﬁve to seven repeating units. The lower degree of PE2gTT
and PE2gT polymerization may be explained by their tendency
to auto-oxidize upon heating (see below paragraph discussing
UV/Vis traces), which potentially compromises the Pd(0) catalytic
cycle.[50] No thermal processes were recorded between 40 – 300°C
in the diﬀerential scanning calorimetry traces of PE2gTT, PE2gT,
PT2gTT, and PT2gT (Figures S14–S17, Supporting Information).
2.2. Optical and Electronic Properties
Density functional theory (DFT) computations of PE2gTT,
PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT trimeric models were conducted at
the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory to probe the energetics and
physical conformation of their materials design. The DFT en-
ergetics of all four polymers are summarized in Table 2. It is
evident polymers with a higher ratio of aryl ether substitutions
per thiophene unit are calculated to have shallower HOMO lev-
els (PT2gTT < PT2gT < PE2gTT < PE2gT), owing to the me-
someric electron-donating eﬀect of aryl ether linkages into the
backbone. All four polymers are predicted to feature highly pla-
nar backbones that are required for good orbital delocalization
and charge transport, achieved through the incorporation of fa-
vorable S…O non-covalent interactions (Figures S18–S33, Sup-
porting Infromation).[51]
The solution state UV/Vis of PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and
PT2gT in chloroform (Figures S34–S38, Supporting Infroma-
tion) all showed evidence of polymer aggregation, with their S0-
S1 transitions at 𝜆max = 552, 583, 529, and 528 nm respectively
exhibiting red-shifted shoulders, that dissipate upon warming
for PT2gTT and PT2gT. Low energy polaron bands at 780 and
760 nm were identiﬁed in the UV/Vis traces of PE2gTT and
PE2gT respectively, that intensiﬁed upon heating in ambient at-
mosphere. This suggests PE2gTT and PE2gT can both be oxi-
dized (i.e., doped) in the as-synthesized “resting” state. Polaron
bands were not observed for PT2gTT and PT2gT, including at
elevated temperatures. The optical bandgaps of PE2gTT, PE2gT,
PT2gTT, and PT2gT were estimated from their onsets of S0-S1
absorption in the solution state, to be 1.9, 1.8, 2.0, and 2.0 eV re-
spectively. UV/Vis of PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT thin
ﬁlms showed broadened transitions when compared against the
solution state, which is explained by packing eﬀects in the solid
state (Figure S39, Supporting Information).
The aqueous thin ﬁlm electrochemistry of all four polymers
was recorded in 0.1 m KCl/H2O (Figure 1). Cyclic voltamme-
try (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SQW) experiments re-
vealed PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT onsets of oxida-
tion at −0.5, −0.7, −0.2 and 0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl respectively.
The HOMOs of PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT were cal-
culated to lie at −4.1, −3.9, −4.4, and −4.9 eV respectively,
by assuming the Ag/AgCl process occurs at −4.6 eV, which
for PE2gTT, PE2gT, and PT2gTT are in good agreement with
DFT calculations. The slight diﬀerence between onset of PT2gT
electrochemical oxidation and its HOMO level from DFT may
be explained by the swelling behavior of its ﬁlms (see Discus-
sion on Device Performance and Thin Film Microstructure and
Swelling sections); electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance
(EQCM, Figure 5a) measurements on PT2gT ﬁlms revealed min-
imal electrolyte swelling at potentials more cathodic than ≈0.5 V
versus Ag/AgCl, impacting counterion diﬀusion within PT2gT
ﬁlms, reasoning the observed discrepancy between its oxida-
tion onset and calculated HOMO.[52] Despite this, the volumet-
ric penetration of counterions into thin ﬁlms of PE2gTT, PE2gT,
PT2gTT, and PT2gT upon bulk electrochemical oxidation was
conﬁrmed through scan rate dependence CV data, that revealed
the diﬀusion-limited nature of their electrochemical oxidation in
accordance with the Randles-Sevcik equation.[53] CV cycling for
12 scans were applied to conﬁrm the excellent electrochemical
stability and reversibility of all four polymers (Figures S40–S43,
Supporting Information). To complement aqueous electrolyte re-
sults, the electrochemistry of all four polymers was also recorded
in 0.1 M [n-Bu4N]PF6/MeCN, revealing similar oxidatively active
behaviors (Figures S44–S57, Supporting Information).
In order to identify the nature of their electrochemically ox-
idized states, thin ﬁlms of all four polymers were also probed
by UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) in 0.1 M KCl/H2O.
For PT2gTT thin ﬁlms (Figure 2), upon application of a po-
tential of −0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl, which was incremented an-
odically to 0.5 V, a gradual quenching of the polymer ground
state transitions was observed concurrent with the appearance
of a polaron band at 850 nm. As the applied potential was
further incremented above 0.5 V, to 0.8 V, a reduction in po-
laron and (remaining) ground state transition intensities were
observed, which is consistent with bipolaron formation.[54] Re-
versing the applied potential incrementally back to −0.2 V re-
sulted in the initial re-intensiﬁcation of polaron state transi-
tions, followed by the restoration of ground state spectra, indi-
cating full electrochemical reversibility of polaronic and bipo-
laronic states. Thus, the UV/Vis SEC of PT2gTT indicates the

on its backbone at anodic potentials above −0.2 and 0.5 V
respectively. Similarly, reversible generation of both polarons
and bipolarons on PE2gTT, PE2gT, and PT2gT backbones were
also observed in their UV/Vis SEC (Figures S58–S69, Support-
ing Information), at onset potentials which are summarized in
Table 3.
2.3. OECT Performance
Fabrication of OECTs with all four polymers PE2gTT, PE2gT,
PT2gTT, and PT2gT was attempted, however ambient oper-
ability in 0.1 m KCl/H2O was observed for PE2gT, PT2gTT,
and PT2gT only. Channel delamination of PE2gTT OECTs oc-
curred upon contact with aqueous electrolyte, irrespective of post-
treatment (annealing) procedures, preventing its stable device
operation, which may relate to its low molecular weight. For
PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT p-type accumulation mode OECTs,
their performance was interpreted using the transconductance
expression (Equation 1, Table 4, Figure 3; Figures S70–S74, Sup-
porting Information; VG = gate voltage, ID = drain current).[12]
VG is interpreted relative to the Ag/AgCl reference potential,
where negative VG corresponds to oxidative biasing of channel
materials.

Overall, PT2gT OECTs exhibited the best performance,
achieving an excellent μC* ﬁgure-of-merit benchmark of 290
F cm−1 V−1 s−1, which can be attributed to its large volumetric
capacitance of 290 F cm−3, that is balanced against a good charge
mobility calculated at 1.00 cm2 V−1 s−1. An even higher volumet-
ric capacitance of 313 F cm−3 was attained in PE2gT OECTs, that
is a record among p-type glycolated OMIECs (Table S1, Support-
ing Information), however, its overall modest μC* ﬁgure-of-merit
of 84.2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 corresponds with a lower calculated charge
mobility at 0.270 cm2 V−1 s−1, oﬀsetting any performance advan-
tages aﬀorded by its exceptional volumetric capacitance. The ob-
served VTh of PE2gT accumulation mode OECTs (−0.106 V) is at a
noticeably more oxidative potential compared to its electrochem-
ical onset of oxidation measured under inert atmosphere, indi-
cating that generation of stable electronic charge carriers (holes)
in PE2gT thin ﬁlms to a suﬃcient concentration to facilitate
electronic conductivity can only be achieved at anodic potentials
above 0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl. PT2gTT exhibited the poorest (accu-
mulation mode) OECT performance among the trio of polymers
tested, with a μC* ﬁgure-of-merit of 61.2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1, owing to
a relatively lowercharge mobility calculated at 0.277 cm2 V−1 s−1
and volumetric capacitance of 221 F cm−3. All OECTs displayed
commendable ON/OFF ratios at factors of 104.
The OECT performance of PT2gT is comparable with the
current state-of-the-art glycolated polythiophene based p-type
OECT materials (Table S1, Supporting Information), and on
par with the most prevalent design, P(g2T-TT).[27,39–43,55–57]
PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT all achieve volumetric capaci-

freshly fabricated versus two-day-aged devices. The ratio of peak
currents attained with new versus aged devices were calculated
to represent active material shelf life stability and are plot against
the corresponding threshold voltages of new devices in Figure 3e,
to illustrate the correlation between glycolated polythiophenes of
a more negative OECT threshold voltage displaying improved
shelf lives, owing to better material resistance against ambient
auto-oxidation.[16,61] OECT shelf life stabilities also reﬂect the av-
erage molecular weights of each active material; PT2gT with the
highest Mn had the best shelf life stability, whereas PE2gT with
poorer shelf life stability had the lowest Mn. Shelf life stabil-
ity of PE2gT OECTs was observed to be compromised by chan-
nel delamination (Figure S75, Supporting Information), which
contextualized with the OECT inoperability of PE2gTT, leads to
the proposition that OECT shelf life stability is optimal for high
molecular weight OMIECs with the best ﬁlm-forming proper-
ties and strongest resistance against ambient auto-oxidation.[62]
Additionally, operational device stabilities of PE2gT, PT2gTT,
and PT2gT were investigated by OECT cycling measurements,
by recording the linear and saturation transfer characteristics
every 6 seconds for over 300 cycles (Figure S76, Supporting

Information), with switching of gate voltage to −0.7 V for PE2gT
as well as −0.8 V for PT2gTT and PT2gTT, to replicate aggressive
cycling conditions that reach beyond the peak transconductance
states of each material, thereby rigorously probing operational
cycling behaviors.[16,63] Of the three polymers, PE2gT OECTs
demonstrated the best operational cycling stability, retaining 34%
of its initial source-drain current on its 333rd cycle (2000 s). On
the other hand, PT2gTT and PT2gT retained 0.12% and 0.05%
of their respective initial source-drain current on the 333rd cycle.
The OECT operational stabilities of PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT
thus follow the reverse correlation to that for shelf life stability,
where materials of a higher threshold voltage/more cathodic ox-
idation onset show better operational cycling stabilities. This is
explained by better energetic resistance of the oxidized state of
glycolated polythiophenes with more cathodic oxidation onsets,
against parasitic redox side reactions with products of the ORR,
notably hydroxide, occuring at the OECT drain in the OFF state,
as characterised previously.[63]
2.4. Thin Film Microstructure and Swelling
To investigatethe eﬀects of their thin ﬁlm microstructure on
OECT performance, the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scat-
tering (GIWAXS) proﬁles of all four polymers were collected
(Figure 4). PT2gTT thin ﬁlms exhibited bimodal crystal orien-
tation, with “lamellar” peaks (100) (at q = 3.3 nm−1, d-spacing =
1.9 nm) and 𝜋–𝜋stacking peaks (at q = 17.3 nm−1, d-spacing =
0.36 nm) showing up along both qr and qz directions. PE2gT thin
ﬁlms displayed marginal preference to interact face-on with the
substrate, as characterized by orientation of the 𝜋–𝜋reﬂection

of PT2gT and OECT inoperable PE2gTT were found to be amor-
phous.
Electrolyte swelling of the active layer material in an OECT
upon electrochemical biasing has a profound eﬀect on device
performance.[27,57,64] The swelling characteristics under electro-
chemical bias of PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT ﬁlms in
0.1 M KCl/H2O were probed using an EQCM, for ﬁve CV cycles
of applied potential between −0.8 and 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl, at
the scan rate of 100 mV/s (Figure 5a). Upon initial incrementa-
tion of the applied potential for PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and
PT2gT ﬁlms past their onset of oxidation up to 0.8 V, signiﬁcant
mass uptakes of varying degrees were observed for all four ma-
terials, assigned to the ingestion of anions and water by ﬁlms
for charge balancing electrochemical oxidation (hole injection).
Upon further cycling from 0.8 back down to −0.8 V, a reversal in
mass uptake was seen for all polymers, correlated to anion/water
ejection commensurate with electrochemical de-doping (reduc-
tion). The baseline swelling of reduced ﬁlms after the ﬁrst cycle
of applied potential were all higher (incrementing with each sub-
sequent cycle) than that recorded for the pristine state at 0% mass
uptake, owing to electrolyte retention within ﬁlms.[65]
Peak mass uptakes at 0.8 V, representing absolute ﬁlm
swelling,[52] were seen to increase from PT2gTT < PT2gT <
PE2gTT < PE2gT with average values of 40%, 55%, 56%, and
140% respectively. This observed trend in increasing EQCM
peak mass uptakes reﬂects the proportionality of polar compo-
nents in each materials design. Among the four polymers re-
ported herein, PE2gT has the largest proportion of polar com-
ponents drawing electrolyte into its ﬁlms, with two triethylene

glycol sidechains plus an ethylenedioxy bridge for each bisthio-
phene repeat unit, reasoning its highest peak EQCM mass up-
take of 140%. The materials design of PE2gTT and PT2gT both
feature a lower proportion of polar components compared to
PE2gT, owing to the elongated thiophene-thienothiophene back-
bone repeat unit in PE2gTT, as well as the lack of an ethylene-
dioxy bridge in the repeat unit of PT2gT (c.f. PE2gT), explaining
their lower peak EQCM mass uptakes. PT2gTT has the lowest
proportion of two polar triethylene glycol sidechains within each
thiophene-thienothiophene repeat unit, correlating with its peak
EQCM mass uptake of 40% that is lowest among the four poly-
mers tested. Diﬀerences in mass uptake between peak at 0.8 V
and baseline swelling at −0.8 V (after the ﬁrst cycle), represent-
ing active (bias-induced) ﬁlm swelling only,[52] were calculated to
be 40%, 75%, 30% and 30% for PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and
PT2gT respectively.
Atomic-force microscopy images (AFM, Figure 5b; Figures
S77–S80, Supporting Infromation) of PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT,
and PT2gT thin ﬁlms uncovered that OECT operable PE2gT,
PT2gTT, and PT2gT all formed smooth thin ﬁlms with RMS sur-
face roughness values of 0.76, 0.71 and 0.49 nm respectively. On
the other hand, PE2gTT formed rougher thin ﬁlms with RMS
surface roughness at 1.2 nm.
2.5. Discussion on Device Performance
Calculated OECT mobilities of PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT were
found to correlate best with their degrees of polymerization.
PT2gT, the polymer with the highest average molecular weight
at Mn = 50 KDa, was calculated to exhibit the highest charge
mobility in OECTs among all polymers tested. This is explained
by the presence of eﬀective electronic charge conduction path-
ways along long polymer strands within its thin ﬁlms,[62,66] which
act as tie-chains between crystalline domains and are less dis-
rupted by thin ﬁlm swelling upon electrochemical oxidation.[57]
On the other hand, PE2gT with the largest EQCM peak electrolyte
uptake at 140% upon electrochemical oxidation to 0.8 V versus
Ag/AgCl and low average molecular weight of Mn = 3.6 KDa,
was calculated to have the lowest OECT charge mobility, owing to
disruption of conﬁned charge conduction pathways by thin ﬁlm
electrolyte swelling.[66] PT2gTT with median average molecular
weight of Mn = 11 KDa was determined to display an intermedi-
ary OECT charge mobility.
Volumetric capacitances of polymers studied were found to
correlate best with the proportion of polar components in each
materials design, which correlates with peak EQCM mass up-
takes linked to electrolyte swelling. PE2gT with the biggest pro-
portion of polar components per bisthiophene repeating unit, has
a record volumetric capacitance of 313 F cm−3 (Table S1, Sup-
porting Information), owing to its signiﬁcant electrolyte swelling,
which facilitate facile thin ﬁlm counterion injection.[67–69] The re-
moval of an ethylenedioxy bridge in the design of PT2gT (c.f.
PE2gT) per bisthiophene repeating unit lowers the proportion-
ality of polar components, correlating well with its comparatively
decreased volumetric capacitance. PT2gTT has the lowest volu-
metric capacitance among the three OECT operational polymers
reported herein, as it has the smallest glycol content per elon-
gated thienothiophene-thiophene repeating unit.
Despite an electrochemically recorded onset of oxidation at
−0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl, generation of suﬃcient, stable electronic
charge carriers (holes) in PE2gT thin ﬁlms to facilitate electronic
conductivity, thereby turning its OECT(s) ON, is only achieved at
a threshold voltage of −0.106 V, making PE2gT OECTs accumula-
tion mode devices. This discrepancy between its oxidation onset
and threshold voltage can be explained by the lack of chemically
anchored counteranionic components in PE2gT, compromising
the persistence of holes in its unbiased state and at cathodic (re-
ductive) potentials. This counteranion phenomenon has been ob-
served previously by Keene et al. for PEDOT:PSS, which feature
the equivalent conjugated backbone as PE2gT, where treatment
of PEDOT:PSS with various alkylamine based de-dopants that
react with acidic PSS to form 1:1 cation-anion pair complexes
results in a shift in OECT threshold voltages to accumulation
mode operation, despite the de-doped PEDOT:PSS materials re-
taining onsets of oxidation at ca. −0.7 V versus Ag/AgCl.[18] The
favourable accumulation mode OECT performance of PE2gT
without the need for chemical de-doping, its straightforward two
step synthesis with a good overall 34% yield,[46] as well as sta-
ble OECT performance with a μC* product ﬁgure-of-merit of
84.2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 comparable to state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS
OECTs,[32,70] demonstrates potential for broader applicability of
PE2gT in bioelectronics, as an alternative to PEDOT:PSS.
The minimal electrolyte swelling change of PT2gT ﬁlms at
potentials below (more cathodic than) ≈0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl
(Figure 5a) is hypothesized to restrict counterion diﬀusion within
its ﬁlms, explaining the anomalous discrepancy between its
solid state electrochemical onset of oxidation and DFT computed
HOMO energy level.[52] The anodic onset of PT2gT ﬁlm oxida-
tion/lower OECT threshold voltage, alongside its high molec-
ular weight, does endow good shelf life stability, owing to
better resistance against ambient auto-oxidation and channel
delamination.[16,61,62] In contrast, the higher cycling stability of
PE2gT may be attributed to its higher OECT threshold volt-
age/more cathodic oxidation onset, which improves resilience of
its oxidized state to redox side reactions with products of ORR.[63]
The inoperability of PE2gTT as an OECT material may be ex-
plained by its low molecular weight at Mn = 3.0 KDa and high
surface roughness, which compromises thin ﬁlm integrity upon
swelling, causing delamination.
3. Conclusion
Motivated by a desire to create synthetically accessible p-type
OMIECs for bioelectronics, we developed four glycolated poly-
thiophenes, PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT, and PT2gT. All polymers
were synthesized by atom-eﬃcient direct arylation polymeriza-
tion, circumventing the need for toxic organometallic precursors.
Aqueous electrochemistry revealed PE2gTT, PE2gT, PT2gTT,
and PT2gT onsets of oxidation at −0.5, −0.7, −0.2, and 0.3 V
versus Ag/AgCl respectively. Overall, PT2gT displayed the cham-
pion accumulation mode OECT performance with an attained
μC* product ﬁgure-of-merit of 290 F cm−1 V−1 s−1, linked to its
superior OECT charge mobility calculated at 1.00 cm2 V−1 s−1
which is enabled by its high degree of polymerization (Mn =
50 KDa). A record volumetric capacitance among p-type glyco-
lated polythiophene OMIECs of 313 F cm−3 was observed for
PE2gT, which is explained by the high proportion of polar gly-

col and ethylenedioxy components in its materials design, that
increases electrolyte swelling of its ﬁlms upon electrochemical
oxidation. The good OECT performance of PE2gT attaining a μC*
product ﬁgure-of-merit of 84.2 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 that is compara-
ble with state-of-the-art PEDOT:PSS devices, coupled with its fa-
vorable intrinsic accumulation mode operation and straightfor-
ward two-step synthesis with a sound overall yield of 34%, makes
PE2gT a prime alternative to PEDOT:PSS in bioelectronics. Addi-
tionally, PE2gT OECTs with the least negative threshold voltage
displayed the best operational cycling stability, owing to better
resistance of its oxidized state against parasitic redox side reac-
tions with products of the ORR, whilst PT2gT OECTs with the
most negative threshold voltage and highest average molecular
weight displayed better shelf life (unbiased) stability, attributable
to better material resistance against ambient auto-oxidation and
ﬁlm delamination. Volumetric capacitances of PE2gT, PT2gTT,
and PT2gT are all among the highest reported for glycolated poly-
thiophenes, setting the precedent for their potential use in energy
storage.
