lectronic charges are usually trans-
ported in crystalline solids such as
metals and semiconductors,13 while
ions are usually transported in aqueous or
organic salt solutions. A signiﬁcant problem
in enabling redox reactions in a wide variety
of systems such as batteries, fuel cells,
and photoelectrochemical cells is the re-
quirement that the active centers must be
located at the junctions of pathways that
transport electronic charge and ions. In
lithium battery electrodes, for example,
electronic conduction is enabled by the
introduction of carbon, while ion conduc-
tion is enabled by the creation of a porous
structure that is backﬁlled with an organic
electrolyte.4 Many of the active materials
used in battery electrodes, such as LiFePO4,
are poor electronic and ionic conductors. In
such cases, the active materials are made in
the form of nanoparticles, which implies
that pathways that conduct electrons and
ions must lie within a few nanometers from
each other. Identifying processing steps
that lead to the presence of active materials
at the junctions of the electron- and ion-
conducting phases on these length scales is
nontrivial. There is thus considerable inter-
est in developing materials that conduct
both electronic charge and ions on the
nanometer length scales.
Simultaneous electronic and ionic con-
duction has been studied extensively in
various inorganic materials.510 In particu-
lar, Reiss has outlined methods for measur-
ing electronic and ionic conduction for
inorganic mixed conductors.9,10 A method
using ac impedance spectroscopy was de-
veloped to determine the presence of in-
dependent pathways for charge transport
and resistance in an inorganic material
between ion blocking electrodes.11 In addi-
tion, some work has been done to model
the impedance spectroscopy of mixed con-
ductors, which included a term for account-
ing for imperfections in the electrodes.12
There also have been a few reports of
simultaneous electronic and ionic conduc-
tion in various polymeric systems.1318
In refs 13 and 14, the authors studied con-
ducting polymers, but were unable to de-
couple the electronic and ionic transport
rates when both charges were present.

ABSTRACT
The main objective of this work is to study charge transport in mixtures of poly(3-
hexylthiophene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (P3HTPEO) block copolymers and lithium bis-
(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl) imide salt (LiTFSI). The P3HT-rich microphase conducts electronic
charge, while the PEO-rich microphase conducts ionic charge. The nearly symmetric
P3HTPEO copolymer used in this study self-assembles into a lamellar phase. In contrast,
the morphologies of asymmetric copolymers with P3HT as the major component are
dominated by nanoﬁbrils. A combination of ac and dc impedance measurements was used
to determine the electronic and ionic conductivities of our samples. The ionic conductivities of
P3HTPEO/LiTFSI mixtures are lower than those of mixtures of PEO homopolymer and LiTFSI,
in agreement with published data obtained from other block copolymer/salt mixtures. In
contrast, the electronic conductivities of the asymmetric P3HTPEO copolymers are
signiﬁcantly higher than those of the P3HT homopolymer. This is unexpected because of
the presence of the nonelectronically conducting PEO microphase. This implies that the
intrinsic electronic conductivity of the P3HT microphase in P3HTPEO copolymers is
signiﬁcantly higher than that of P3HT homopolymers.

Ren et al. measured the electronic and ionic con-
ductivity of poly(3-methylpyrrole-4-carboxylic acid)
using

measurements.15
Plocharski studied the electronic and ionic conduc-
tion of doped poly(p-phenylene) homopolymer, but
the source of ionic charges was not established.17
There is considerable interest in regioregular poly
(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) due to its ability to conduct
electronic charge.1922 The planarity of the polymer
backbone is enabled by head-to-tail coupling of the
thiophene monomer, and this promotes interchain
ππ interactions.23 A nanoﬁbrillar morphology, seen
in both electron microscopy and atomic force micro-
scopy, is believed to be a signature of these inter-
actions.22,24 Polythiophene and its derivatives are,
however, semiconductors in their pristine form, and
doping is necessary for the generation of charged car-
riers. Reported conductivity values for pristine regiore-
gular P3HT range from 105 to 108 S/cm.2530 P3HT is
a stable hole conductor (p-type semiconductor) when
a dopant, such as I2, is used to oxidize the thiophene
unit, resulting in electronic conductivities of about
10 S/cm.31,32 Electronic conductivity of P3HT ﬁlms can
also be increased by the application of electrochemical
potentials in the presence of a liquid electrolyte.33,34
The McCullough group ﬁrst showed that block
copolymers comprising P3HT and insulating blocks
self-assembled into conductive nanoﬁbrils in a matrix
of the insulating block.32 They have reported this
morphology in various block copolymers such as
P3HT-b-polystyene,35
P3HT-b-polyisoprene,35
and
P3HT-b-poly(methyl acrylate).36 Highly doped P3HT-
containing block copolymers with 40% P3HT by weight
exhibit reported electronic conductivities as high as
2 S/cm.37 The processing steps used to create the
samples aﬀect the observed morphology. Solution-
cast samples made under rapid evaporation conditions
result in highly disordered structures, while those
made under slow evaporation conditions display the
nanoﬁbril morphology.32 To our knowledge, there is
only one report wherein traditional morphologies such
as alternating lamellae and hexagonally packed cylin-
ders are reported to form in P3HT-containing block
copolymers.38 The absence of these morphologies in
most P3HT-containing block copolymers is attributed
to the dominance of ππ interactions and crystal-
lization, the very eﬀects that are responsible for elec-
tronic conduction in P3HT. This suggests that the self-
assembly of P3HT-containing block copolymers is of-
ten kinetically trapped.32
The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship
between morphology and charge transport in mixtures
of P3HTPEO block copolymers and lithium bis-
(triﬂuoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI). The P3HT
block enables electronic transport, while the PEO block
enables ion transport. Our results indicate that LiTFSI
partitions into both P3HT and PEO microphases. The
eﬀect of this on charge transport is quantiﬁed. Our
early results on this system have appeared in a brief
communication.39
Our group has studied the relationship between
charge transport and morphology in lamellar block
copolymers with an ion-conducting block and an
insulating block.4043 These studies have shown that
conductivity, σ, is proportional to the volume fraction
of the conducting block, φ. We thus obtain
σ ¼ fφσ0
(1)
where σ0 is the intrinsic conductivity of the conducting
phase and f is a factor that accounts for the morphol-
ogy (also called tortuosity factor in the literature,
although this term is usually used in the context of
porous materials with ill-deﬁned pores). For randomly
oriented grains comprising alternating conducting and
nonconducting lamellae, f = 2/3. The maximum value
of f is obviously unity. This limit is appropriate when
transport limitations at grain boundaries are not
signiﬁcant.40 Equation 1 can readily be applied to
systems wherein more than one kind of charge is
transported. A major objective of the present study is
to test the applicability of such a framework to
P3HTPEO/LiTFSI blends. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst attempt to quantify the relationship between
morphology and simultaneous transport of electronic
and ionic charges.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The characteristics of the P3HT homopolymer and
the P3HTPEO block copolymers and our nomencla-
ture are summarized in Table 1. Figure 1a shows the
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) intensity, I, versus
magnitude of the scattering vector, q, of P3HTPEO-
(92) at 90 C in the absence and presence of salt at
r0 = 0.085, where r0 is the molar ratio of lithium ions to
ethylene oxide moieties. The neat sample (r0 = 0)
produces a featureless scattering proﬁle. However, with
the addition of salt, the scattering proﬁle shows a broad
primary peak at q = q* = 0.29 nm1 corresponding to a
characteristic periodic length scale, d = 22 nm (d = 2π/q*),
and another broad peak at q = 0.50 nm1. Similar
data are obtained from P3HTPEO(62), as shown in

Figure 1b. The SAXS proﬁle of neat P3HTPEO(62)
at 90 C is featureless, but the addition of salt at r0 =
0.085 results in broad peaks at q* = 0.37 nm1 and
q = 0.74 nm1, corresponding to d = 17 nm. The broad
peaks seen in Figure 1 are not characteristic of tra-
ditional block copolymer morphologies and are
thus likely to be indications of the often-reported
nanoﬁbrillar morphology in P3HT-containing block
copolymers.
Dramatically diﬀerent results are obtained from neat
P3HTPEO(54) as shown in Figure 2a. At room
temperature, the SAXS proﬁle contains a primary peak
at q* = 0.28 nm1 and a higher order peak at 2q*
indicative of a lamellar phase corresponding to a
domain spacing, d (the center-to-center distance be-
tween adjacent PEO lamellae), of 22.5 nm. A featureless
SAXS proﬁle is obtained when the sample temperature
is increased to 60 C, indicating the disappearance of
the lamellar morphology. The lamellar peaks return
when the sample is cooled to room temperature. The
SAXS data suggest the presence of a reversible order-
to-disorder phase transition in the neat P3HTPEO-
(54). It is not clear if the high temperature phase in
P3HTPEO(54) contains nanoﬁbrils. In Figure 2b, we
show the SAXS proﬁle of P3HTPEO(54) at r0 = 0.085
at room temperature and 90 C. At both temperatures
we observe peaks at q* = 0.31 nm1 and 2q*, indicating
the presence of a lamellar structure with d = 20.3 nm.
The lamellar structure of P3HTPEO(54) at r0 = 0.085
was conﬁrmed by TEM, as shown in the inset of
Figure 2b. There is good agreement between the
length scale of the periodic structure determined by
SAXS and TEM (about 20 nm). It should be noted that
the TEM sample was not stained; that is, the natural
electron density contrast between P3HT and PEO in the
presence of LiTFSI is responsible for the image. The
TEM image contained isolated dark features, as shown
in Figure 2b. This may be due to residual homopoly-
mers or some other contaminant in our samples. TEM
images of P3HTPEO(62) and P3HTPEO(92) did
not contain any discernible features. The SAXS results
for all P3HTPEO block copolymers indicate that the
addition of LiTFSI enhances the microphase separation
(Figures 1 and 2). This is also true in polystyrene-b-
poly(ethylene oxide) (PSPEO) block copolymers.40,43
Figure 2. (a) SAXS of P3HTPEO(54) at r0 = 0. A lamellar
microstructure is seen at 28 C, while the featureless proﬁle
is obtained at 60 C. The lamellar microstructure returns
after cooling to 28 C. (b) SAXS of P3HTPEO(54) at r0 =
0.085 indicating a lamellar microstructure. The inset shows
the bright ﬁeld transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
image of a P3HTPEO(54) r0 = 0.085. Contrast in the
image arises from density diﬀerences between the P3HT-
rich (dark) and PEO with LiTFSI (light) microphases.
Figure 1. (a) SAXS of P3HTPEO(92) and (b) P3HTPEO-
(62) at 90 C. The SAXS proﬁle at r0 = 0 is featureless, while
the addition of LiTFSI (r0 = 0.085) indicates the presence of
microphase separation. The features shown here are seen at
all temperatures from 28 to 160 C.

Figure 3 compares the wide-angle X-ray scattering
(WAXS) proﬁles of the P3HTPEO copolymers with
those of a P3HT homopolymer at 90 C, which is above
the melting temperature of PEO. The WAXS proﬁles
thus reﬂect the local structure of the P3HT crystals. All
of the proﬁles are dominated by the (100) and (010)
reﬂections of the P3HT chains that are due to the side-
chain spacing and ππ stacking, respectively. Weaker
peaks and shoulders corresponding to the (200) and
(300) reﬂection are also seen in all of the samples.
Qualitatively similar behavior is seen when salt is
added to the P3HTPEO block copolymers. The WAXS
data suggest that the introduction of the PEO block
and the addition of LiTFSI salt do not have a signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the local arrangement of the P3HT segments.
Interestingly there is no diﬀerence in the WAXS data
from samples that contained nanoﬁbrils [e.g., P3HT
PEO(62)] and those that did not [P3HTPEO(54)].
In Figure 4a, we show the results of impedance
spectroscopy experiments on P3HT(5) sandwiched
between nickel electrodes at 90 C. The impedance
data show one semicircle. The equivalent circuit used
to analyze these data is a parallel combination of a
resistor and CPE (constant phase element). Extrapolat-
ing the semicircle in Figure 4a to the real axis gives the
electronic resistance of P3HT(5). It is reasonable to
assume that the transport in this sample is dominated
by electronic charge, and we thus obtain the electronic
conductivity of P3HT(5), σHT, of (4.9 ( 0.6)  108 S/cm.
This value is within the range of reported condu-
ctivity values of undoped regioregular P3HT (105 to
108 S/cm).2530 Our measured σHT is at the lower end
of the range of the published data. Lui et al. found
that in-plane conductivity of regioregular P3HT was
105S/cm,whilethatinthethrough-planegeometrywas
108 S/cm.28 Our measurements were performed using a
through-plane geometry. Diﬀerences in sample prepara-
tion must also be accounted for when comparisons
between reported literature values are made. All of our
measurementswere made onfreeze-dried, bulk samples.
In Figure 4b we show the Nqyuist plot of PEO
homopolymer (Mn = 2 kg/mol) with LiTFSI at r0=
0.085. As is typically the case with ion-conducting
polymers, we see a single semicircle at high frequen-
cies and a capacitive tail at low frequencies. Standard
analysis using the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 4b
results in the conclusion that the ionic conductivity of
PEO, σEO, at r0 = 0.085 is 2.05  103 S/cm. It should be
noted that the semicircle approaches the Z0 axis at a
frequency of about 1 kHz, which is signiﬁcantly higher
than the semicircle touchdown of P3HT(5) (Figure 4a),
where it is in the mHz range. The capacitive tail appears
in Figure 4b but not in Figure 4a because nickel is a
blocking electrode for ions but not for electronic
charges. The lack of a capacitive tail is a clear indication
of the presence of pathways for the transport of
electronic charge. The presence of one semicircle in
both Figure 4a and b is a signature of the presence of a
single dominant pathway for charge transport in both
P3HT and PEO homopolymers.

Figure 5a shows impedance spectroscopy data
from the P3HTPEO(62)/LiTFSI mixture at r0 = 0.085
sandwiched between nickel electrodes at 90 C.
The presence of three semicircles in Figure 5a, and
the absence of such features in Figure 4a and b,
suggests the presence of multiple charge transport
pathways in the P3HTPEO(62)/LiTFSI mixture.
Again, the lack of a capacitive tail indicates the pre-
sence of continuous pathways for the transport of
electronic charge. The total electronic resistance of
the sample was determined from dc polarization ex-
periments. A small dc potential was applied until a
steady-state current was observed, as shown in
Figure 5b. The corresponding resistance at steady state
is the total electronic resistance because the nickel
electrode blocks ions. In Figure 5c, the dc potentials are
plotted versus steady-state current. The data follow
Ohm's law, and the total electronic resistance of the
sample, Rdc, is 1.30 kΩ 3 cm2. This value is very close to
the sum of the three semicircles in Figure 5a labeled as
R3. Therefore, extrapolation of the low-frequency semi-
circle to the Z0 axis gives the total electronic resistance
of the P3HTPEO(62)/LiTFSI mixture.
As a ﬁrst approximation, one may model the data
from salt-containing P3HTPEO copolymers (e.g.,
Figure 5a) by proposing an equivalent circuit that is a
linear combination of the equivalent circuits of the two
constituent homopolymers. We expect the sample to
contain bicontinuous ion- and electron-conducting
channels, and thus the parallel combination of the
two circuits is appropriate. Unfortunately, the equiva-
lent circuit for this combination gives two Nyquist
semicircles, which is inconsistent with the data in
Figure 5a. The inset of Figure 5a shows the simplest
equivalent circuit that is consistent with the data. The
equivalent circuit comprises a parallel combination of
an electronic and ionic conductor and an additional
resistor/constant-phase-element circuit in series with
the ionic conductor. This equivalent circuit gives three
semicircles, consistent with the data in Figure 5a. Three
semicircles have been reported before in inorganic
mixed conductors, and in that case, the additional
circuit has been attributed to the grain boundary
resistance to either electronic or ionic transport.11,46
Jamnik and Maier proposed that the middle semicircle
reﬂects the fact that the electrodes are not completely
reversible to the transfer of electronic charges.12 The
physical underpinning of the added circuit (the circuit
in blue in Figure 5a inset) is uncertain. We will show
that this limitation does not impede our ability to
determine the overall electronic and ionic conductivity
in our samples. The resistance and capacitance of the
blue portion of the equivalent circuit in Figure 5a inset
are referred to as Rgr and Qgr. The equivalent circuit in

completeness. The solid curve in Figure 5a is a ﬁt of
the data to the equivalent circuit in Figure 5a inset.
Not surprisingly, the two important parameters Re and
Ri obtained from the ﬁt are consistent with those
obtained by using eq 2.
The analysis described above was used on r0 = 0.085
P3HTPEO(62)/LiTFSI samples with diﬀerent thick-
nesses. In Figure 6a and b we plot Ri and Re thus
obtained as a function of sample thickness, L. Both
electronic and ionic resistance show approximately
linear trends with thickness. In principle, the linear ﬁts
in Figure 6 should go through the origin. The y-inter-
cept of the Ri versus L plot (8 Ω 3 cm2) is relatively
small, while that of the Re versusLplot (250 Ω3 cm2) isnot.
This may be due to errors intrinsic in extracting two
independent resistances from the data or the presence of
a non-negligible interfacial resistance to the transport of
electronic charge at the electrodepolymer interface.
The remainderofthispaper isbased ondata obtained
from samples with L = 150200 μm. In Figure 7a and b
we show typical impedance data at 90 C obtained from
P3HTPEO(92) and P3HTPEO(54) with LiTFSI at
r0 = 0.085, respectively. The data contain three semi-
circles, and thus the method described above can be
used to determine electronic and ionic conductivities of
the samples. However, the relative magnitudes of the
semicircles vary widely due to diﬀerences in Ri and Re.
The curves inFigure 7 are ﬁts usingthe equivalentcircuit
shown in Figure 5a, inset, which enable determination
of Ri and Re. Re is much greater than Ri for all three
sample, implying that R1 ≈Ri (see eq 2).
Electronic and ionic conductivities of P3HTPEO(92)
and P3HTPEO(62) at r0 = 0.085 at selected tempera-
tures were determined by the methods given above, and
the results are shown in Figure 8. Both samples show an
increase in σe and σi as temperature is increased from 40
to 90 C. The temperature dependence on ionic conduc-

motion, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature,
and T0 is a reference temperature, which is typically
25 K below the glass transition temperature of PEO.47
We left T0 as a ﬁt parameter because the glass transition
temperature of PEO changes with added salt. The
temperature dependence on electronic conductivity
was ﬁt to the Arrhenius equation:
σe ¼ Ae exp
Ee
RT


(5)
where σe is the electronic conductivity, Ae is a pre-expo-
nential factor, and Ee is the activation energy for electronic
charge transport. The application of the Arrhenius model
assumes the conduction mechanism is through thermally
activated hopping, which is common for undoped semi-
conducting polymers.48 The resulting ﬁt parameters using
eqs 6 and 7 are given in the caption of Figure 8.
To further analyze the electronic and ionic charge
transport properties, we will focus on the data ob-
tained at 90 C. Figure 9 shows σe and σi of all three
P3HTPEO samples with and without LiTFSI. The ionic
conductivity, σi, of P3HTPEO(54) at r0 = 0.085 is
(3.9 ( 0.6)  104 S/cm, which is the highest among
the three block copolymer samples. This is not surpris-
ing, as this polymer has the highest PEO volume
fraction. The ionic conductivities of P3HTPEO(92)
and P3HTPEO(62) at r0 = 0.085 are within experi-
mental error, in spite of the diﬀerence in PEO volume
fraction. The values of σi reported here are similar to
the reported ionic conductivities of other PEO-contain-
ing block copolymers.42 All of the previous data (e.g.,
ref 42) on PEO-containing block copolymers are re-
stricted to systems wherein the nonionically con-
ducting block was insulating. The values of σe of
P3HTPEO(92) and P3HTPEO(62) at r0 = 0.085
are (9 ( 4)  106 S/cm and (1.0 ( 0.3)  105 S/cm.
A signiﬁcantly lower value of (3.6 ( 0.9)  108 S/cm
was obtained from P3HTPEO(54) at r0 = 0.085. The
neat P3HTPEO samples (r0 = 0) exhibited impedance
datathat were similartothoseobtained fromP3HTPEO/
LiTFSI mixtures, but with two semicircles, as shown in
Figure 10 for P3HTPEO(62). The analysis described

respectively. The VTFﬁt parametersare Ai = 1.63  103 S/cm,

P3HTPEO(62). The Arrhenius ﬁt parameters are Ae =

and Ae = 3.1  102 S/cm S/cm and Ee = 0.255 eV for
P3HTPEO(62).

made with (r0 = 0.085) and without (r0 = 0) added salt. The
φHT values for the three block copolymers are given in
Table 1. The φHT = 1 data set corresponds to homopolymer
P3HT(5), and the salt concentration of 0.085 is actually rHT.
The ionic conductivities of the P3HTPEO block copolymers
were measured only with added salt (r0 = 0.085). The dashed
lines are guides for the eye.

above holds for these samples, and the low-frequency
Z0 intercept gives Re. The dc test showed that σe of neat
P3HTPEO(62) was (4.4 ( 0.3)  107 S/cm at 90 C,
which is in good agreement with σe of (5 ( 2) 
107 S/cm from ac impedance spectroscopy. The eﬀect
of added salt on the electronic conductivities of the
P3HTPEO copolymers is shown in Figure 9. σe of
P3HTPEO(54) does not change appreciably when r0
is increased from 0 to 0.085. One might anticipate this
result if all of the added LiTFSI were preferentially
located in the PEO microphase. In contrast, σe values
of P3HTPEO(92) and P3HTPEO(62) increase by
factors of 28.1 and 23.0 when r0 is increased from 0 to
0.085, indicating that the electronic conductivity of the
P3HT microphases is aﬀected by LiTFSI.
The above observation motivated us to prepare
several P3HT(5)/LiTFSI mixtures in the concentration
range 0 e rHT e 0.15, where rHT is the molar ratio of
LiTFSI to 3-hexylthiophene monomer (refer to Experi-
mental Methods section for details). The mixtures
appeared homogeneous and with a clear red color
when viewed by the naked eye (which could indicate
the absence of chemical doping). Figure 11a shows the
Nyquist plot of the P3HT(5)/LiTFSI mixture at rHT =
0.085. It contains two semicircles with no capacitive
tail, and thus the touchdown of the second semicircle
gives the electronic resistance Re, which was conﬁrmed
by dc measurements. In Figure 11b, we show the
electronic conductivity of P3HT(5)/LiTFSI mixtures,
σHT, as a function of rHT at 90 C. σHT increases rapidly
with increasing rHT in the rHT e 0.04 regime. The right-
hand-axis in Figure 11b plots σHT,N as a function of rHT,
where σHT,N is the normalized electronic conductivity
of P3HT(5)/LiTFSI, deﬁned as the ratio of σHT at the rHT
of interest to σHT at rHT = 0.
Returning to the electronic conductivity data in
Figure 9, we make the simplifying assumption that
the
increase
in
electronic
conductivity
of
the
P3HTPEO/LiTFSI mixtures relative to neat P3HTPEO
is due to mixing of some of the added LiTFSI with the
P3HT. We deﬁne k for each of the block copolymers as
k ¼ σe(r0 ¼ 0:085)
σe(r0 ¼ 0)
(6)
The values of k for P3HTPEO(92), P3HTPEO(62),
and P3HTPEO(54) are 28.1, 23.0, and 1.14, respec-
tively.TheconcentrationofLiTFSIintheP3HTmicrophase
is obtained by determining the value of rHT in Figure 11b
where σHT,N = k. The LiTFSI concentrations in the P3HT
microphase thus obtained are tabulated in Table 2. Also
given in Table 2 are the inferred LiTFSI concentrations in
the PEO microphase obtained by mass balance:
wEO
M0, EO
r0 ¼ [1  wEO]
M0, HT
rHT þ wEO

(7)
where rEO is the salt concentration in the PEO micro-
phase, wEO is the PEO microphase weight fraction,
M0,EO is the PEO repeat unit molecular weight, and
M0,HT is the P3HT repeat unit molecular weight. It is
evident from Table 2 that about 20% of the added salt
partitions into the P3HT microphases in samples P3HT
PEO(92) and P3HTPEO(62). This suggests that
LiTFSI has an aﬃnity toward the P3HT microphases
with the nanoﬁbrillar morphology.

where φEO is the PEO volume fraction and σEO(rEO) is
the ionic conductivity of pure PEO homopolymer at a
salt concentration of rEO at the temperature of interest.
If eq 1 was valid and the intrinsic conductivity of the
PEO microdomains in the P3HTPEO/LiTFSI mixtures
was identical to σEO, then σi,N = fi, the morphology
factor for ionic conduction. The values of σEO used in
the normalization were obtained at rEO values provided
in Table 2 using previously reported conductivity
measurements on mixtures of PEO homopolymer
and LiTFSI.49,50 The ionic conductivity of LiTFSI and
PEO homopolymer mixtures is independent of poly-
mer molecular weight over the range of this study
(Mn,PEO of 2 to 4.2 kg/mol).51 This justiﬁes our use of a
molecular-weight-independent value of σEO in eq 8.
The values of σi,N thus obtained at 90 C are listed in
Table 3. For well-connected lamellae, the expected
value of fi is 0.67. The reported values of σi,N in Table 3
are less than this, an observation that is consistent with
measurements of ionic conductivity of PSPEO block
copolymers in the low molecular weight limit.43
The electronic conductivity of P3HTPEO block
copolymers can be analyzed by a scheme similar to
that described in the preceding paragraph. The nor-
malized electronic conductivity of a block copolymer,
σe,N, is deﬁned as
σe, N ¼ σe(r0 ¼ 0:085)
φHTσHT(rHT)
¼
σe(r0 ¼ 0)
φHTσHT(rHT ¼ 0)
(9)
where φHT is the P3HT volume fraction, σe is the
electronic conductivity of the block copolymer, and
σHT(rHT) is that of P3HT(5) homopolymer at salt con-
centration rHT for each block copolymer given in
Table 2. The second equality arises due to our approach
for obtaining rHT. As was the case with normalizing
ionic conductivity, we assume that σHT is independent
of P3HT molecular weight over the range of this study
(Mn,P3HT of 5 to 9 kg/mol). To our knowledge, the eﬀect
of molecular weight on conductivity, the product of
charge carrier mobility and concentration, for bulk
P3HT samples has not been reported. Previous work
shows that changing Mn,P3HT from 3 to 30 kg/mol
results in a factor of 25 increase in mobility in a diode
conﬁguration52 and a factor of 10 000 increase in
mobility in a transistor conﬁguration.53 It is important
to note that the reported mobilities are obtained from
measurements on thin ﬁlms (20200 nm) and that the
measured properties depend on substrate eﬀects and
processing conditions. Further work is thus required to
determine the limitations of the proposed normaliza-
tion procedure for electronic conductivity in block
copolymers.
The values of σe,N obtained from eq 9 are listed in
Table 3. The values of σe,N of P3HTPEO(92) and
P3HTPEO(62) are signiﬁcantly greater than unity. It
is clear that in this case, σe,N is not equal to the
morphology factor, which by deﬁnition is less than
unity. The σe,N values listed in Table 3 should be
interpreted as lower bounds for the increase in intrinsic
electronic conductivity of P3HT microphases due to
nanostructuring. Thus the intrinsic electronic conduc-
tivity of P3HT domains in P3HTPEO(62) is at least a
factor of 12 larger than that of P3HT(5) homopolymer.
This factor is 8 for P3HTPEO(92) and not signiﬁ-
cantly
diﬀerent
from
unity
for
P3HTPEO(54)
(Table 3). Note that the largest increase is obtained in
the P3HTPEO(62) sample, wherein the molecular
weight of the P3HT block is closely matched to the
P3HT homopolymer. The higher conductivity of the
asymmetric block copolymers is unexpected due to
the presence of the electronically insulating PEO mi-
crophase. Studies on poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3AT)
and electronically insulating polymer composites have
shown a similar increase in electronic conductivity at
high P3AT weight fractions.5456 The results of these
studies suggest that properties of the material sur-
rounding the crystalline P3AT regions aﬀect the elec-
tronic charge transport.55
It is important to note that the results in Tables 2 and
3 are based on the simplest possible interpretation of
the available data. The factor by which conductivity of
pure P3HT increases with added salt might be diﬀerent
from that obtained in P3HT-containing block copoly-
mers. Note that the dependence of σe on φHT is non-
monotonic and presented on a logarithmic scale in
Figure 9. This cannot be anticipated from eq 1, which
predicts a monotonic (linear) increase of σe with
increasing φHT.
CONCLUSIONS
We have explored the relationship between mor-
phology and transport of both electronic and ionic
charge in block copolymer/salt mixtures. SAXS experi-
ments, used to determine morphology, indicate the
presence of a lamellar phase in neat P3HTPEO(54)
at room temperature and a disordered phase at tem-
peratures above 60 C. In contrast, SAXS proﬁles of
neat P3HTPEO(62) and P3HTPEO(92) are fea-
tureless, indicating that the morphology is dominated
by P3HT nanoﬁbrils. After the addition of LiTFSI at
r0 = 0.085, the SAXS proﬁles from all three samples
contain signatures of microphase separation. At this
concentration, SAXS proﬁles from P3HTPEO(54)/
LiTFSI mixtures contain clear signatures of a lamellar
morphology at temperatures up to 90 C, while
SAXS proﬁles from P3HTPEO(62)/LiTFSI and P3HT
PEO(92)/LiTFSI mixtures contain broad shoulders
that cannot be interpreted in terms of speciﬁc
morphologies.
A key diﬀerence between the present samples and
those used in previous studies on charge transport in
block copolymers32,40,42,57,58 is both ionic and elec-
tronic charges are transported simultaneously in the

present system. A combination of ac impedance spec-
troscopy and dc measurements enables the determi-
nation of electronic and ionic conductivity in our
samples. We discovered that the addition of LiTFSI to
P3HT homopolymer results in an approximately 400-
fold increase in electronic conductivity at high salt
concentrations. By combining this result with measure-
ments of electronic conductivity of P3HTPEO copo-
lymers with and without salt we estimated the extent
to which LiTFSI partitions between the P3HT and PEO
microphases. The ionic conductivities of P3HTPEO/
LiTFSI mixtures are lower than those of PEO/LiTFSI
mixtures. This is expected due to the presence
of the nonionically conducting P3HT microphases
in the P3HTPEO/LiTFSI mixtures (see eq 1). Neat
P3HTPEO copolymers transport only electronic
charge. The electronic conductivities of the neat
asymmetric P3HTPEO copolymers are signiﬁcantly
higher than those of the P3HT homopolymer. This is
unexpected because one expects the presence of the
nonelectronically conducting PEO microphases in
P3HTPEO to result in a decrease in electronic con-
ductivity (see eq 1). We hope to identify the reason for
this observation in future work.
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Materials. Ethynyl-terminated poly(3-hexylthiophene) (ethynyl-
P3HT) was synthesized using Grignard metathesis (GRIM)
polymerization.59 Azide-terminated PEO (Azide-PEO) (2000 g/mol)
was purchased from Polymer Source. Azide-PEO (4200 g/mol)
was obtained through end-group functionalization of mono-
methoxy-PEO60 that was purchased from Polymer Source. The
ethynyl-P3HT and azide-PEO were coupled using 1,3-dipolar
cylcoaddition click reaction to yield P3HTPEO block copoly-
mer (refer to ref 39 for more details on synthesis and purifi-
cation). The molecular weight and regioregularity of ethynyl-
P3HT was determined using 1H NMR. The polydispersity of the
polymer was determined on a Viscotek GPC (gel permeation
chromatography) instrument (TDA 302), a set of three Waters
Styrogel HR columns (two HR3 and one HR4 column) and with
tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the mobile phase (flow rate of 1 mL/min,
35 C). The GPC was calibrated using polystyrene standards.
Table 1 shows the polymers used in this study. P3HT(5) is an
allyl-terminated homopolymer, which is also synthesized and
purified in the same manner as ethynyl-P3HT.
Sample Preparation and Measurements. All of the steps used to
make the P3HTPEO/LiTFSI mixtures were conducted in argon-
filled gloveboxes (MBraun and Vacuum Atmospheres). LiTFSI
was purchased from Novolyte and dried under vacuum at
120 C for 3 days to remove any residual water. Neat P3HTPEO
samples were dried under vacuum at 90 C for 23 days be-
fore making salt samples. LiTFSI/dry-THF mixtures were pre-
pared in a volumetric flask at a concentration of 0.5 g/mL. The
P3HTPEO samples were dissolved in dry benzene at a con-
centration of 5 mg/mL in scintillation vials. Heating the sample
slightly using a heated stir plate helped the dissolution process.
An appropriate amount of LiTFSI/dry-THF solution was added to
the P3HTPEO solution to obtain the desired salt concentra-
tion. The P3HTPEO salt solutions were stirred overnight to
ensure good mixing and placed in an airtight desiccator, which
was transferred into a freeze-drying unit. The process ensured
no exposure to air. PEO/LiTFSI and P3HT(5)/LiTFSI samples were
prepared in a similar manner. We define r0, the initial total salt
concentration in the block copolymer, as the ratio between
moles of LiTFSI and moles of EO units. We define rEO as the ratio
between moles of LiTFSI and moles of EO units. rHT is the ratio
between moles of LiTFSI and moles of 3-hexylthiophene unit.
Neat P3HTPEO and P3HTPEO/LiTFSI samples were
pressed into 125 μm thick Garolite spacers and placed in an
airtight sample holder with Kapton windows. The samples were
annealed overnight under vacuum at 90 C. Small-angle X-ray
scattering and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements were
taken at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 7.3.3 at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. A silver behenate
sample was used as a standard for SAXS and aluminum
standard for WAXS. The 2D scattering patterns were collected
on an ADSC CCD detector or 1 M Pilatus detector. The scattering
patterns were reduced using the Nika macro for Igor Pro
developed by Jan Ilavsky at Argonne National Laboratory. The
measured two-dimensional scattering data were averaged
azimuthally to obtain intensity (I) versus magnitude of the
scattering wave vector q = 4π sin(θ/2)/λ, where λ is the
wavelength of the incident X-rays (0.124 nm) and θ is the
scattering angle.
The sample for transmission electron microscopy was pre-
pared by dip coating a copper grid in a P3HTPEO/THF solution
(10 mg/mL) and annealed at 100 C overnight under vacuum.
Bright-ﬁeld TEM images were obtained using a Ziess LIBRA
microscope operating at 200 kV. Contrast in the image arises
from density diﬀerences between the P3HT-rich (dark) and PEO
with LiTFSI (light) microphases.
Samples for electrochemical measurements were prepared
by hot pressing freeze-dried samples into a 125 μm thick
Garolite G-10 spacer with an inner-hole diameter of 3.88 mm.
For thickness-dependent measurements on the P3HTPEO/
LiTFSI mixture, we also used a 250 μm G-10 spacer and a 25 μm
Kapton spacer. Nickel foil current collectors were pressed at
1000 psi on both sides of the spacer at 90 C for 30 s using a
Carver press (in a glovebox). The NipolymerNi sandwich was
allowed to anneal for an additional 30 min at 90 C after the
pressure was released. The actual thickness of the polymer in
the spacer was measured after annealing. Due to overﬁlling the
spacer hole, the actual thickness is slightly larger than the
spacer thickness, but is not an issue for taking measurements,
as the polymer is a hard solid at 90 C. The sandwich was sealed
in aluminum-laminated pouch material (Showa Denko) using a
vacuum sealer (Packaging Aids Corp) with nickel tabs in an
argon glovebox. Our approach ensures that the samples are air-
and water-free.
The impedance spectroscopy measurements were made
using either a Bio-Logics VMP3 or a Solartron 1260 instrument
with applied ac voltages in the 1050 mV range and frequen-
cies ranging from 1 MHz to 1 mHz. Resistances were calculated
from the complex impedance data (Z* = Z0  iZ00), where Z0 and
Z00 are the real and imaginary impedances, respectively, using
Nyquist plots (Z00 vs Z0). The conductivity, σ, is given by
σ ¼ L
R
(10)
where L is the polymer thickness and R is the resistance
(Ω 3 cm2), obtained from intersections of the Nyquist plots on
the Z0 axis. Small dc potentials between 50 and 50 mV were
imposed on the P3HT-containing samples, and the steady-state
current response was measured using the Biologic VMP3
instrument. All conductivity measurements were averaged over
a minimum of three samples, and all error bars were calculated
from one standard deviation. All reported conductivity values
are from ac impedance measurements unless stated otherwise.
Equivalent Circuit Curve Fitting. Experimental ac impedance
spectroscopy data were analyzed using equivalent circuits
composed of constant phase elements (CPE) and resistors.
The impedance of a CPE is given by

where Q is the capacitance (constant phase element), ω is the
angular frequency, and a is a measure of nonideality of the
capacitor. The unit for Q is F 3 sa‑1. Both Q and a are fitting
parameters, and a = 1 corresponds to the ideal capacitor.
Physical arguments were used to arrive at a particular equiva-
lent circuit, and the Randomize þ Simplex algorithm built into
the EC-Lab software package was used to fit the impedance
data. In all cases, we report the parsimonious result, i.e., the
simplest equivalent circuit with the fewest elements that can
describe the data.
