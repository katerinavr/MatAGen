Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) utilize ion flow from the electro-
lyte to modulate the electrical conductivity of the whole bulk organic semicon-
ductor channel. With the characteristic of mixed ionic-electronic conducting
in the entire volume, OECTs exhibit high transconductance and act as good
transducers, particularly in bioelectronics. To gain high-performance OECTs,
developing novel high-performance polymeric semiconductors is important. In
this article, operation principles, performance evaluations, and polymerization
methods are first discussed. We then analyze the molecular design strategies
for high-performance OECT materials and highlight the characteristics and
effects of backbone design and side chain engineering. Finally, we discuss
some neglected and unsolved issues and provide an outlook for the OECTs
research and development.

INTRODUCTION
Organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is a type of
transistor whose organic semiconducting layer contacts
directly with an electrolyte.1,2 Unlike the double layer
charge generation mechanism in organic field effect tran-
sistors (OFETs), the ions in the electrolyte of OECTs can
penetrate into the organic film driven by voltage (below
1 V), which changes the conductance of the film. There-
fore, OECTs are regarded as ion-electron transducers,
and the semiconductors used in OECTs are also referred
to
as
organic
mixed
ionic/electronic
conductors
(OMIECs), including conjugated polymers, conjugated
polyelectrolytes (CPE), and so on.3 Because of the ion-
electron transformation in the bulk of OMIECs, OECTs
show high-signal amplification capacity, which makes
them suitable for the detection of small signals. Besides,
the liquid environment, softness of organic semiconduc-
tors, and solution processing method make OECTs ideal
for biocompatible devices.4 With the characteristics men-
tioned above, OECTs are widely studied in the field
of chemical and biological sensors,5–8 biological inter-
faces,9,10 and artificial synapses.11–14
The first OECT is developed by Wrighton and
co-workers in 1984 using polypyrrole (PPy) as the
semiconducting layer.2 In the later 30 years, poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfo-
nate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Figure 5A) has become the most
popular material in OECTs due to its high conductivity,
hydrophilicity, and commercial availability. While the
high performance of PEDOT:PSS-based OECTs have
shown many attractive applications, PEDOT:PSS still pre-
sents several drawbacks, including its (i) complex system,
impeding the understanding on polymer structure-device
performance, (ii) large current at zero bias, leading to
high
power
consumption
for
wearable
electronics,
(iii) high acidity which may affect living systems.15 To
overcome those shortcomings, plenty of researches have

focused on modifying the PEDOT:PSS system,16 while
others concentrated on developing new polymer back-
bones. Their achievements greatly enriched the OECT
materials family and many polymers have exhibited per-
formances superior to PEDOT:PSS.
In this article, we aim to outline recent progress in
the design of OMIECs and summarize the molecular
design strategies for high-performance OECTs. In the
first part, we focus on the electrolyte/polymer interface
and the behavior of ions to introduce the operation prin-
ciples, performance parameters, and benchmarks of an
OECT device or material. In the second part, we review
the
main
high-performance
semiconductors
and
expound on the relationship between molecular struc-
tures and their OECT performances from two aspects:
backbone design and side chain engineering. In this arti-
cle, conjugated polymers for OECTs are labeled as the
second-generation and third-generation semiconducting
polymers according to Heeger's classification.17 The
second-generation
semiconducting
polymers
mainly
refer to the derivatives of polythiophene. The other poly-
mers are classified as third-generation semiconducting
polymers including
donor–acceptor (D–A)
polymers
which are based on a combination of electron-rich
(donor)
and
electron-deficient
(acceptor)
units,
acceptor–acceptor polymers, and some ladder-type poly-
mers. The main polymerization methods and small mol-
ecule structures of OECT materials are also introduced.
In the last part, we give our overview on the challenges
and future research directions in the development of
OECTs.

OPERATION PRINCIPLES,
PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS,
AND POLYMERIZATION OF OECTs
2.1

Operation principles
In an OECT, the source (S) and drain (D) electrodes are
connected by a semiconductor layer (channel), and the
gate (G) can control the conductance of the film via an
electrolyte (Figure 1A). When a bias voltage (VD) is
applied between the drain and source (grounded), charge
carriers flow in the channel, producing current (ID). The
bias voltage (VG) applied to the gate can drive ions in
the electrolyte into the channel, change the conductance
of the semiconductor and modulate ID.
OECTs have a similar device structure to electrolyte-
gated organic field effect transistors (EGOFETs). The
major difference between OECTs and EGOFETs is that
ions
can/cannot
penetrate
into
the
polymer
film
(Figure 1B,C). For an EGOFET, its operation principle is
similar to OFET, while the dielectric is an electrolyte.
Ions in the electrolyte make directional migration driven
by VG, inducing an electrode double layer (EDL) on the
electrolyte/semiconductor film interface. The induced
carriers hugely change the film's conductivity and lead to
the increment of ID. For OECTs, there are two opera-
tional modes: depletion and accumulation mode. Some
polymers work in the depletion mode, such as PEDOT:
PSS. For OECTs work in the depletion mode, there are
mobile carriers (holes) in pristine film, which makes the
devices in on state at zero bias (VG = 0 V). When a

negative VG is applied, cations in the electrolyte penetrate
into the film, inducing the disappearance of holes, and
switch the devices into off state. For an OECT that works
in the accumulation mode, the device is in off state at
zero gate bias. When VG drives anions (p-type) or cations
(n-type) penetrate into the film, inducing holes or elec-
trons, the device is switched from off state to on state.
Many researchers have studied and proven the exis-
tence of two operation principles (field-effect and electro-
chemical principles).18–20 Ginger and co-workers utilized
in situ electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM) and
found that polymer semiconductors can simultaneously
exhibit
field-effect
and
electrochemical
operation
regimes, which are related to nanoscale film morphology,
ion concentration, and electric potential.21 The ion infil-
tration capacity of the polymer film, which is determined
by the molecular structure and molecular packing, plays
a key role in OECTs. Because of the presence of electro-
lytes, many design principles established over the past
two decades for OFETs must be adjusted before applied
to OECTs, and the role of hydrophilic side chains should
be highlighted. In the second part of this article, some
effective design principles for high-performance OECT
semiconductors are introduced and summarized.

Performance parameters
For OECTs, due to the high capacitor of the electrolyte, a
small gate voltage (jVGj < 1 V) can modulate channel
current (ID) via ion doping. The modulation relationship
can be observed by transfer curves (ID–VG curve with a
constant VD bias) and output curves (ID–VD curve with
a constant VG bias). The steeper the transfer curve is, the
larger the drain current change for a given gate voltage
signal. According to the Bernards model,22 the first deriv-
ative
of
the
transfer
characteristic,
namely
trans-
conductance
(gm = ∂ID/∂VG),
can
be
fitted
to
the
formula:
gm ¼ W=L

j,
ð1Þ
where W, L, and d, are the channel width, length, and
thickness, respectively, μ denotes the charge carrier
mobility, C* denotes the capacitance of the channel per
unit volume, and Vth is the threshold voltage. We can
also read out the on–off ratio (ID,on/ID,off) from the trans-
fer curve, which is the symbol of transistors' switching
performance.
gm was considered as the figure of merit for OECTs
and researchers sought after high gm via many methods,
including enhancing the Wd/L. Afterward, gm,nom (gm/
[Wd/L]) has been widely used as a comparison of
different materials.23 In recent years, Rivnay and co-
workers labeled the product of mobility and volumetric
charge storage capacity (μC*) as the benchmark of OECT
materials.24 Huge C* indicates superior ion penetration
ability and high-charge storage properties. However,
when ions infiltrate into semiconducting polymers, they
can induce traps due to coulombic interactions and cause
structural and energetic disorders, which will impede
charge carrier transport and reducing μ.25 Recently, the
trade-off between μ and C* has attracted more attention
for the design of high-performance OECTs.26
Although Bernards model has been widely used, a
few new models have recently been proposed to more
accurately
describe
mixed
ionic-electronic
transport
behavior in OECTs. Lüssem and coworkers took lateral
ion currents in the channel into account and found that
the equilibrium state of an OECT is not as the prediction
of Bernards model.27 They discovered that ion diffusion
and accumulation have a large impact on the potential
drop in the channel, which is a dynamic other than
static process. In addition, some other models introduce
more parameters
to
describe
the
OECT
operation
behavior.28–30 These models further conform to the actual
situation while they greatly increase the difficulty of com-
parison between channel materials and are seriously
affected by the device configuration. Therefore, for a con-
venient and relatively fair comparison, μC* obtained
using the Bernards model has been widely used as a key
parameter to compare the performance of different chan-
nel materials in this article.
For an OECT, one of the challenges is the long
response
time
(including
switching
on
(τon)
and
switching off time (τoff), typically >100 μs), largely due to
the slow migration rate of the ions. Therefore, the
response speed is also an important parameter for
OECTs. τ is determined both by electronic transit time
(τe) and ion transit time (τi). The electronic transit time is
described by τe = L2/μVd, and τi is dictated by the prod-
uct of the resistance of the electrolyte and the capacitance
of the channel.22,31 The kilohertz response speed of
OECTs is adequate for quasi-static biosensor applications
and some electrophysiological signals recording but
limits their applications requiring fast response, such as
electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement. The μC*
value and the other parameters of an OECT highly
depend on the polymer chemical structures. Therefore,
exploring molecular design strategies is necessary.

Material type and synthesis
As we know, most OECT materials are polymers up to
now. The crystallinity of polymer films is generally
LI AND LEI

lower than that of small molecules. The amorphous
morphology is of benefit to ion infiltration and mainte-
nance of electron transport path in doped systems.20,32
Compared with polymers, small molecules have higher
purity and reproducibility. There are only two cases of
small
molecules OECTs up
to
now.
Nielsen
and
coworkers built two p-type small molecules using the
benzene and EDOT units, named P2E2 and P4E433
(Figure 2A). To improve charge injection and overcome
the low viscosity of small molecule solutions, they
blended these molecules with high-molecular weight
polyethylene oxide (PEO). Although the performances
of the small molecules are not outstanding (the highest
μC* value <1 F cm1 V1 s1), the design strategies and
processing
methods
are
enlightening.
Ginger
and
coworkers designed a EG side chain grafted fullerene,
named C60-TEG, as an n-type material for OECTs34
(Figure 2B). The hydrophilic fullerene derivative shows
a high-μC* value of 7 ± 2 F cm1 V1 s1, which repre-
sents a promising prospect of small-molecule semicon-
ductors for OECTs. There are few studies on small-
molecule OECT materials so far, and the structure-per-
formance relationship is not clear enough. Therefore,
this article will focus on the molecular design of poly-
mer OECTs in the next part.
The main polymerization methods for OECT poly-
mers are shown in Figure 3. PEDOT:PSS (Figure 5A) and
its derivatives are usually synthesized by oxidative poly-
merization or electropolymerization. Kumada catalyst
polymerization is commonly used in polythiophene
derivatives, such as poly(6[thiophene-3-yl]hexane-1-sul-
fonate) tetrabutylammonium (PTHS)35 (Figure 3D). Stille
polymerization is the most widely used method for OECT
polymers, not only for polythiophene derivatives23 but
also for D–A polymers.36 In general, a larger polymer
molecular weight allows for better organic device perfor-
mance. However, the molecular weight of D–A polymers
is limited when grafted with EG side chain.37,38 Recently,
Lei et al. optimized the catalyst and solvent in Stille poly-
merization39 and found that Pd(PPh3)4/Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and
N,N-dimethylformamide/chlorobenzene 1:1 mixture can
provide significantly higher molecular weights, which
can solve the low-molecular weight issue for ethylene
glycol (EG) side chain polymers.
The aforementioned polymerization methods usu-
ally have some disadvantages such as the use of hazard-
ous monomers, toxic solvents, or transition metal
catalysts.40 For environmental protection and bio-
electronic applications, several greener polymerization
methods have been applied for OECTs, including aldol
condensation polymerization for PgNaN38 (Figure 7D),
and direct arylation polymerization for ProDOT(OE)-
DMP41 (Figure 5A). It is believed that polymerization
methods will continue expanding to fully release the
potential of molecular structure design for high-perfor-
mance OECTs.

MOLECULAR DESIGN
STRATEGIES FOR HIGH-
PERFORMANCE OECTs
Different from OFET materials that only consider
charge carrier mobility, both charge carrier (hole/

electron) transport and ion diffusion are important for
a high-performance OECT material. Improving ion
penetration capacity through side chain engineering
for classic polythiophene system and investigating
additives for PEDOT:PSS system is in full flourish. In
addition, the polythiophene system has also been fur-
ther expanded to regulate the material properties,
adding
fused
rings
in
the
backbone
such
as
bithiophene, benzodithiophene, and so on. These strat-
egies improved device performance to a large extent
and become the basic rules for OECT molecular design-
ing. However, modifications to the second-generation
semiconducting polymers are limited, especially on the
energy level. To further develop n-type materials and
enhance
performances
of
OECTs,
D-A
polymers
with different backbones and side chains have been
introduced in OECTs and have shown relatively excel-
lent performance. In this part, we review the second
and
third-generation
semiconducting
polymers
for OECT and describe their design strategies from
backbone design and side chain engineering. Besides,
their polymerization methods and small molecule
structures for OECT materials are also introduced
briefly.

Side chain engineering
The
second-generation
semiconducting
polymers
for
OECTs are based on polythiophene derivatives. They all
exhibited p-type behaviors and their properties can be
largely
modulated
by
side
chains
engineering.
For
OFETs, alkyl side chains are usually used to enhance sol-
ubility and tune molecular packings. However, for
OECTs, alkyl side chains are not preferred due to their
hydrophobicity and poor ion infiltration capacity,19 while
EG side chains and ionic side chains are more widely
used to ensure adequate hydrophily and ionic affinity.
Besides, the side chain will also interact with the main
chain, affecting the energy level of the molecule, packing
mode, and other properties.
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Figure 4A) is one of
the earliest studied organic semiconductors in OFET.
However, because of the hydrophobic alkyl side chains,
the ions infiltration ability of P3HT film is poor, which
leads to unsatisfactory behavior for OECTs. Therefore,
adjusting the side chain to get a better ion migration

property is one of the main strategies to enhance the
OECT performance of polythiophene derivatives.
P3MEEMT (Figure 4C) is a polythiophene derivative
with
EG-based
side
chains.20
Compared
to
P3HT,
P3MEEMT shows a faster ion injection speed, leading to
better OECT performances. Furthermore, Ginger and co-
workers found that hydration has a huge impact on both
ion transport and carrier transport. On the one hand,
larger hydrophobic anions can lower the threshold volt-
age, suggesting water may hinder the ions' infiltration.
On the other hand, the presence of water may damage
the
electronic
connectivity
between
the
crystalline
regions, thus lowering the charge carrier mobility in the
solution. This work not only used side chain engineering
to develop a new material but also revealed the important
role of film morphology of OECTs. Afterward, Inal and
Thelakkat et al. investigated the role of alkyl spacer on
OECTs performance of P3MEEMT derivative and found
that ethyl spacer effectively improved crystallinity and
mixed-conduction properties.42
CPE are a class of conducting polymers possessing
polar electrolyte groups covalently attached to the conju-
gated backbone.43 The polar electrolyte groups make
CPE hydrophilic and improve their ion mobility. Poly
(3-carboxypentylthiophene) (P3CPT)18 (Figure 4B), the
end of the side chain of P3HT replaced by a carboxyl
group, shows electrochemical operation mode under high
gate voltage. Similarly, PTHS (Figure 4D)35 leads to high-
transconductance accumulation mode OECTs. Including
EG as a co-solvent further improves transconductance
and response time compared to devices from pristine
PTHS films, demonstrating that film morphology also
has a huge effect on carrier and ion transport for CPE.
However, the high solubility of PTHSM+ (M+
referred to different cations) polyelectrolytes may induce
degradation during device operation, while the addition
of a crosslinker to prevent degradation means a sacrifice
of carrier and ion conductivity. It is an optional solution
that adopting the strategy of copolymerization. Inal, The-
lakkat,
and
co-workers
developed
a
copolymer

PTHSTMA+-co-P3HT (Figure 4E).26 The copolymer is
crystalline and easily oxidizable, thus enhancing the hole
mobility (0.017 cm2 V1 s1) and reducing the Vth. More-
over, high C* (>100 F cm3) is achieved, indicating that
the hydrophobic 3HT does not hamper ion transport.
Besides, better stability in water is achieved by copoly-
merization, thus reducing the amount of cross-linker
needed. Therefore, copolymerization, which combines
hydrophilic segments (ionic side chain) and hydrophobic
segments (alkyl side chain) is a promising strategy to
obtain high-performance OECT materials.
Based on polythiophene, Rivnay and co-workers used
p(a2T-TT) and p(g2T-TT) (Figure 4E) to control the oper-
ation mode through side chain engineering.19 Both the
alkyl and triethylene glycol (TEG) side chain are con-
nected to the thiophene backbone by an oxygen atom
because the intramolecular sulfur-oxygen interactions
can induce backbone coplanarity and increase the effec-
tive
conjugation
length,
which
efficiently
improves
charge transport and decreases the ionization potential
(IP). With alkyl side chains, p(a2T-TT) behaves in a
mixed operation mode which means ions can penetrate
into semiconductor film partially, deeper than EDL but
shallower than the whole bulk. However, with the help
of TEG side chains, p(g2T-TT) exhibits terrific OECT per-
formance, including fast switching speed on the micro-
second scale and high μC* (261 F cm1 V1 s1). In the
following research, Savva and co-workers confirmed that
the increment of hydrophilic side chain content could
lead to greater hydration and expansion of the channel
during electrochemical doping.44 Although the ion injec-
tion and transport are improved, the swelling negatively
influences the electron transport and, consequently, the
performance of OECTs. With the percentage of TEG side
chains increasing from 0 (alkyl side chain) to 100% (p
(g2T-TT)), gm, μ, and C* of devices are all improved,
while a polymer with the same backbone and hexakis EG
side chains exhibits lower gm, μ, and C* than p(g2T-TT),
resulted
from
film
deformation.
Similar
research
was implemented by McCulloch and co-workers. The
length of the EG side chain is optimized on g2T-T
(Figure 4G).45 The redistribution of side chain on differ-
ent proportions is proved to strongly impact the water
uptake, and p(g2T2-g4T2) realized the highest μC* of
522 F cm1 V1 s1 and current retentions (Figure 4H).46
Therefore, there is a trade-off between ionic and elec-
tronic conduction with the choice of proper EG side
chains and content, which makes side chain engineering
changeable but not random.
From the researches mentioned above, we can con-
clude that side chain engineering has a unique status in
molecular design for OECTs. In backbone engineering
that we will discuss below, EG side chains and ionic side
chains are also used in the molecular structure and play
an important role in ion transport.
3.1.2

Backbone design
Backbone design based on the polythiophene system
mainly focuses on introducing fused rings to modulate
molecular planarity and stacking mode, thus improving
charge transport. Here we will discuss benzodithiophene
and alkylenedioxythiophene units used in OECTs.
Benzodithiophene is a conjugated building block with
good planarity and linearity. Nielsen, Giovannitti, and
co-workers designed a series of BDT (benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]
dithiophene)-based
polymers
to
elucidate
structure–
property guidelines required for accumulation mode
OECTs23,47 (Figure 5B). The alkoxy side chains in the
4,8-positions of BDT increase the electron density of
the BDT structure due to the resonance effect. Thiophene
(T), bithiophene (T2), thienothiophene (TT), TEG side
chain
functionalized
bithiophene
(g2T)
and
3,30-
dimethoxy-2,20-bithiophene (MeOT2) are comonomers
that were chosen due to their electron-rich conjugated
systems and high degrees of backbone coplanarity, thus
achieving low operation voltages and good charge trans-
port properties. These thiophenes comonomers bring in
various charge distribution and degrees of backbone cur-
vature, which influence energy level, side chain orienta-
tion,
molecular
packing,
and
consequently
charge
transport. Besides, g2T-T (Figure 4G) was designed to
investigate the role of the π-conjugated backbone and its
charge transport properties. gBDT-T, gBDT-T2, and
gBDT-TT all have IPs around 4.7–4.9 eV, whereas the
electron-rich
gBDT-MeOT2,
g2T-T,
and
the
fully
TEGylated gBDT-g2T have significantly lower IPs around
4.3–4.4 eV. g2T-T exhibits the best OECT performance
due to its terrific carrier and ion transport. Polymers con-
taining the TEGylated bithiophene unit (g2T-T and
gBDT-g2T) are more electrochemically stable than poly-
mers
with
the
TEGylated
benzodithiophene
unit
(gBDT-T, gBDT-T2) during cyclic voltammetry cycle and
spectroelectrochemistry test. The reason initially was
attributed to the lower IP and proper electrochemical
potential window of g2T.23 Afterward, through the analy-
sis of infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory,
it was thought that the actual cause might be the
TEGylated BDT unit (gBDT-T2 and gBDT-TT) can poten-
tially be oxidized at the 4,8-positions to form a quinone
structure, which would result in a decrease of the donor
strength as well as breaking the effective conjugation by
the introduction of electron-withdraw quinone groups.
However, gBDG-MeOT2 would not form a quinone struc-
ture mainly because the MeOT2 unit can stabilize
LI AND LEI

polarons on the polymer backbone due to the increased
charge stabilization as well as a reduced orbital and
charge density on the BDT groups.47 The achievements
inspire us that oligo(ether) chains directly link onto the
electroactive backbone may render the polymer unstable
and suffer irreversible degradation during electrochemi-
cal doping, while proper electron-rich donor units can
effectively solve this problem.
For redox applications, 3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene
(XDOT)-based polymers have several distinct advantages
over general thiophene derivatives. Owing to the dis-
ubstitution of π-donating oxygen atoms, they are much
easier to be oxidized. Furthermore, as the alkyl bridge
can protect the conjugated backbone against nucleophilic
attack, the polymers can exhibit high-redox stability.41
These advantages make XDOT-based polymers promising
materials for OECT.
PEDOT:PSS is the most widely used polymer for
OECT. Poly(styrene sulfonate) is added as a dopant to
induce holes in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene). Many
researchers have focused on modifying PEDOT:PSS sys-
tem with additives to enhance performance.48–50 Some
additives are usually added to improve the performance
of PEDOT:PSS film including (i) EG, to enhance conduc-
tivity, (ii) dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA), to adjust
film-forming properties, and (iii) (3-glycidyloxypropyl)
trimethoxysilane (GOPS), to crosslink the film for stable
operation in aqueous conditions.49 PEDOT:PSS-based
OECTs that operate in depletion mode exhibit high gm in
the range of millisiemens and a response time in the
range of tens of microsecond.48 By solvent-assisted crys-
tallization, crystallized PEDOT:PSS (Crys-P) exhibited
remarkable
OECT
performance,
with
μC*
of
490 F cm1 V1 s-1.51
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)
doped with tosylate (PEDOT:TOs) (Figure 5A) has a simi-
lar doping principle to PEDOT:PSS while tosylate (Tos) is
a small molecule. By vapor-phase polymerization, a film
cast from a precursor solution containing Tos moieties is
exposed to EDOT vapor to yield the conducting polymer
PEDOT:Tos.52 By this process, researchers can also incor-
porate different biomolecules with PEDOT:Tos in the
channel of OECTs, which makes the PEDOT:Tos a prom-
ising biological function material.31
ProDOT(OE)-DMP is an oligo(ether)-functionalized
propylenedioxythiophene
(ProDOT)
copolymer
(Figure 5A).41 ProDOT(OE) was copolymerized using
direct(hetero)arylation
polymerization
(DHAP)
with
2,2-dimethyl (DMP) functionalized dibromo ProDOT,
yielding ProDOT(OE)-DMP. Two OE side chains confer
sufficient polarity for organic solubility and aqueous
redox activity without rendering the polymer water-solu-
ble. The DMP functionalized ProDOT ensures a low oxi-
dation potential (low Vth) and enhances capacitance.
Moreover, comparing to Stille cross-coupling, which is
widely
used
for
synthetic
OECT
polymers,
DHAP,
is more environmentally and biologically friendly. The
OECTs based on ProDOT(OE)-DMP exhibit impressive
performance and the design strategies can be used to
develop more electrochemical active materials.
In terms of the second-generation semiconducting
polymers for OECTs, making the best of side chain engi-
neering is the main way to obtain high-performance
OECT materials, including ionic chains, EG side chains,
and alkyl spacers. Backbone engineering, such as BDT
and XDOT, also brings lots of possibilities for the design
of materials. Beyond that, the copolymerization of struc-
tural units with different functions is also a promising
strategy via morphology control. Nevertheless, limited

performance modulation of the thiophene system and
the lack of high-performance n-type materials are still
the choke points for the development of OECT-based
logic systems and sensors with amplification capability.53
So more ingenious molecular design strategies are still
needed.

The third-generation
semiconducting polymers for OECTs
The third-generation semiconducting polymers mainly
refer to D–A polymers, which have huge energy level
adjustability
and
high-carrier
mobility
compared
to
polythiophene. In the past few years, the fruitful chemi-
cal structures, readily modulated energy level, high-
charge carrier mobilities have made D–A conjugated
polymers very attractive in organic electronics.54–58 Some
of these building blocks have been introduced into the
design of OECT polymers. Similar to polythiophene poly-
mers, it is also particularly important to modify them to
meet the ionic infiltration characteristics. Due to the bet-
ter rigidity and planarity of the backbone, D–A polymers
always suffer from poor solubility, which needs to be
adjusted by side chains. Recently, many studies have
focused on side chain engineering, which modulates the
type, length, branching, and density of side chains to gain
high-performance OECTs based on D–A polymers. In
this part, we will summarize high-performance D–A
polymers and special type polymers for OECTs and high-
light their molecular design.
The p-type D–A polymers are studied extensively to
catch up with and exceed the high performance of the
second-generation semiconductors. At first, the perfor-
mances of D–A polymers were poor and disappointing,
but with further study in the past 10 years, the potential
of p-type D–A polymers for OECTs is unleashed and their
performances
gradually
approach
most
of
the
polythiophene derivatives (Table 1), as we will discuss
below.
Inspired by CPE, Nguyen and co-workers utilized
PCPDTBT-SO3K (CPE-K) as an active material of OECTs59
(Figure 6A).
CPE-K
contains
cyclopentadithiophene
(CPDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) alternating D–A units
and is highly conductive because it is self-doped by the sul-
fonate side chains. CPE-K has been successfully used as a
neutral interlayer in OPVs and as an active layer in ther-
moelectric devices, and also shows good performance in
OECTs. Although this is the only study on D–A CPE so
far, this molecular design may have great potential in the
future.
Isoindigo (IID) is a well-established electron-deficient
building block for D–A copolymers for solar cells and
FETs.60–62 Due to its two lactam rings, IID has a strong
electron-withdrawing character and can shift energy level
to a low LUMO. Yue and co-workers developed a series
of IID-based polymers for OECTs. They mainly investi-
gated the effect of EG and alkyl chains on the OECT per-
formance. They used different side-chain functionalized
IID units as donor and EDOT groups as acceptor to syn-
thesis a series of p-type organic semiconducting polymers
for OECTs, named PIBET.63 Four different types of side
chains are linked on the lactam nitrogen positions of IID:
hybrid alkyl-EG chains (PIBET-AO), linear hydrophilic
EG chains (PIBET-O), branched hydrophilic EG chains
(PIBET-BO),
and
branched
hydrophobic
alkyl
chains (PIBET-A) (Figure 6B). They also chose the bis-
thiophene unit as a comparison (PIBT-BO) (Figure 6C).
PIBET-BO exhibited a much lower Vth than PIBT-BO. In
addition, to affect characteristic parameters, side chains
largely impact the operational stability of D-A polymers
as well. OECTs based on PIBET-A showed the lowest gm,
norm, and response speed due to the inefficient injection/
ejection of hydrated electrolyte ions. Increasing the num-
ber of EG side chains from linear in PIBET-O to
branched in PIBET-BO induced a decrease in gm,norm as
well as device stability. PIBET-AO-based devices have a
similar gm,norm with PIBET-O, while operational stability
and substrate adhesion are drastically enhanced. Devices
based on PIBET-AO exhibited preserved performance
after extensive ultrasonication (1.5 h) or after continuous
on–off switching for over 6 h, while the PIBET-A and
PIBET-O based devices retain only 27 and 10% of the on
currents after 40 minutes of on–off switching. The supe-
rior stability of PIBET-AO is ascribed to its alkyl frag-
ments close to the backbone, which prevents alterations
in
film
morphology
and
might
negatively
impact
interchain transport and device performances over time.
Therefore, a balanced combination of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic chains is a potential way to develop long-
term stable OECT semiconducting materials.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is one of the most exten-
sively studied building blocks for building D–A poly-
mers.64
Giovannitti
and
co-workers
synthesized
copolymers based on pyridine-flanked DPP (PyDPP) with
T2 or MeOT2, named p(gPyDPP-T2) and p(gPyDPP-
2MeOT)
(Figure 6D).65
Due
to
the
more
localized
wavefunction for the hole polaron which is expected to
stabilize the hole polaron further, p(gPyDPP-2MeOT)
exhibited better redox stability, just like gBDT-MeOT2.47
Contrary to what we mentioned above, Giovannitti and
co-workers emphasized that polymers with large IPs can
shift the operational voltages of OECTs to avoid oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) occurring in ambient condi-
tions.
They
demonstrated
that
p(gPyDPP-2MeOT)
(IP = 5.0 eV)
did

conditions, while PEDOT:PSS and p(g2T-TT) (Figures 5A
and 4F) were observed spontaneous ORR. Furthermore,
both PEDOT:PSS and p(g2T-TT) predominantly produced
H2O2, which does harm to local biological environment
and may accelerate device degradation while p(gPyDPP-
MeOT2) would form mostly H2O during ORR. The
molecular design strategy presented in the achievement
is viable for developing bioelectronic materials with no
hazardous side-products and low-power consumption.
In the past 2 years, as a versatile building block, D–
A polymers based on DPP in OECTs have been studied
extensively. McCulloch et al.36 and Lei et al.39 reported
DPP-based high-performance OECTs separately almost
at the same time (Figure 6E). Although the backbone
structure is the same, they get different results and con-
clusions. McCulloch and co-workers found p(gDPP-T2)
showed the highest μC* and p(gDPP-MeOT2) had the
lowest performance of 57 F cm1 V1 s1, which is
attributed
to
different
polaron
delocalization
by
authors. However, with the same backbone structure
and longer/branched side-chain, Lei and co-workers
found the strongest electron-donating moiety MeOT2
was the best donor, and the performance can be opti-
mized to 216 F cm1 V1 s1. Moreover, they summa-
rized a series of strategies for high-performance OECTs,
including donor, side chain, molecular weight, and
processing conditions. Strong electron-donating moiety,
branched EG chains, optimized polymerization condi-
tions and polar solvent are the keys to get high-
performance D–A polymers for OECT. These results
have revealed the complexity and systematization of D–
A polymers with EG side chains. In addition, other
DPP-based polymers with different donors and side
chains are studied.66,67
Because it is difficult to lower the LUMO energy
levels to achieve electron transport and maintain air sta-
bility, high-performance n-type conjugated polymers are
very rare. Moreover, the existence of electrolyte (most
commonly NaCl solution) aggravates the instability of
polymers and makes the development of n-type OECTs

troublesome. The lack of n-type polymers whose perfor-
mances can be comparable to p-type restricts the develop-
ment of complementary logic circuits, which are the
basis of flexible electronics. D–A polymers and special-
type polymers, including donor–donor polymers and
ladder-type polymers, enable the implementation of n-
type OECTs.
The first n-type OECT polymer is a napthalenediimide-
bithiophene polymer (p[gNDI-gT2]) (Figure 7B) developed
by
Giovannitti
and
co-workers.37
NDI
is
a
highly
electron-deficient unit while bithiophene is electron-rich.
The backbone structure contributes to a high electron
affinity (EA = 4.12 eV), and a low ionization potential
(IP = 4.83 eV) of the polymer. The ambipolar OECTs based
on p(gNDI-gT2) exhibited relatively balanced ambipolar
charge transport characteristics and showed no degrada-
tion under 2 hours continuous cycling in water at proper
operating voltage. This achievement demonstrates that
water-stable
n-type
polymers
are
achievable
and
indicates a new direction for n-type conjugated polymers.
In
a
follow-up
study,
Giovannitti
and
co-workers
developed a series of D–A polymers based on naphthalene-
1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-diimide-bithiophene
(NDI-T2)
(Figure 7C)tostudyhowthesubstitutionofalkylsidechain
with EG side chains affects device performances.68 These
random copolymers are named P-0 to P-100 with the
increasing percentage of the EG chain. To achieve stable
volumetric charging (pure OECT mode), the EG chain
needs to be at least 50% (P-50), while polymers with lower
EG chain percentages showed a mixed operation and
required high-operation voltages. Among the polymers, P-
90 exhibited the most outstanding OECT characteristic (μ,
C*, gm,norm). The reduction voltage onset (Vth) decreased
from 1.1 to 0.2 V with the percentage increasing from 0 to
100%. NDI-T2 copolymers with alkyl chains show high-
electron mobilities (μP-0 = 0.132 cm2 V1 s1), while the
electron mobility drops rapidly when the alkyl chains are
replaced by polar EG chains (μP-25 = 0.00184 cm2 V1 s1,
μP-90 = 0.000238 cm2 V1 s1). This achievement alerts us
to the merits and shortcomings of EG chains, which we
should take into account in studies and applications. How
to obtain high C* while preventing the attenuation of
mobility is still a hard nut to crack. Recently, the modula-
tion of alkyl spacers and side chains has been explored on

NDI-T2,69,70 and the highest μC* for n-type can be opti-
mized to 1.29 F cm1 V1 s1(P[C6-T2]).
Among the third-generation semiconducting poly-
mers for OECTs, the most unique n-type polymer is poly
(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL)71 (Figure 7A).
BBL is a ladder-type polymer with high rigidity and pla-
narity of the π-conjugated polymer backbone, leading to
high EA. The backbone and no side chain characteristic
promote delocalization of the carriers in BBL and make
intramolecular transfer easier, thus providing
high-
polaron mobility along the ladder-type chain. The struc-
ture advantages lead to the high C* of BBL, and
OECTs based on BBL show high transconductance and
excellent stability in ambient and aqueous media (1 h
switching test).
Recently, McCulloch and co-workers developed high-
performance n-type polymers38 (Figure 7D). With only
electron-deficient units and a torsion-free backbone, the
PgNaN
and
PgNgN
have
deep-lying
LUMO
lower
than 4.0 eV. The alkyl chain of PgNaN improved the
solubility during polymerization and helped gain larger
molecular weight than PgNgN. The PgNaN shows high-
OECTs
performance
with
an
average
μC*
of
0.662 F cm1 V1 s1, and the metal-free aldol condensa-
tion polymerization is a benefit for the application of
bioelectronics.
Up to now, these D–A polymers have shown huge
potential in OECTs, especially for n-type devices, and
performances of p-type polymers gradually approaching
the polythiophene system. We believe that with the in-
depth study of the charge transport mechanism in OECTs
and the further expansion of material structures, D–A
polymers will show superior performances and exert
their advantages in researches and applications.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
The past decade has witnessed the prosperity and fast
development of OECTs. Effective molecular design strat-
egies, various device structures, and several promising
applications have been explored. In this article, we par-
ticularly emphasize the role of molecular design strate-
gies toward high-performance OECTs. As discussed
above, we could conclude that: (i) proper hydrophilic
side chains, such as EG chains, ionic chains, alkyl
spacers, and partially alkyl/EG chains can ensure ade-
quate ion infiltration during the electrochemical dop-
ing/dedoping process while minimizing unwelcome side
effect to hole/electron transport; (ii) backbone engineer-
ing can adjust frontier orbital energy levels, inter-
molecular
interactions,
and
thereby
charge
carrier
mobilities, and so on.; (iii) the interaction between the
side chains and the backbone may influence molecular
packing,
device
stability,
and
other
parameters
(e.g., response time).
Multiple processes are involved in the operation of
OECTs, including ion injection, redox charging, and elec-
tron transport. However, a clear structure–property rela-
tionship has not been well established. For instance,
FIGURE 8
Summary of OECT performances via (A) μC*-1/τ, and (B) μC*-jVthj plot for the polymers in Table 1. The polymers in the
upper right corner of both images have better overall properties. The response speed is limited to 1–105 Hz for OECTs and shows a large
variation among polymers. Although the μC* value of many polymers is outstanding, the jVthj of the device is unsatisfactory, which is more
obvious in D–A polymers. OECT, organic electrochemical transistor

there may be a trade-off between μ and C* in OECTs, and
thus the optimum side chain type, length, and distribu-
tion may vary from polymer to polymer. Besides, D–A
polymers
have
exhibited
superior
performances
in
OFETs, OPVs, and other organic electronics, while in
OECTs, the performance of the polythiophene system is
still better than those of D–A polymers (Table 1). For
these issues, we conjecture and have partially proven that
different polymerization methods, processing conditions,
the batch-to-batch variation (especially for molecular
weight) will all influence device performances, which
cannot be ascribed only to poor molecular design issues.39
Besides,
many
other
factors,
including
molecular
packing,72 supramolecular assembly,73 film morphology,74
and counterions75,76 also have great influences on device
performance, which have not been fully explored and
understood yet. Therefore, careful molecular design is just
the first step for the performance enhancement, and dur-
ing the study of materials, we need to consider all the
influential factors more comprehensively.
In addition, the evaluation methods for an OECT
device still need to be improved and unified. In terms of
device stability, there are various evaluation methods,
including long-time switching test, adhesion ability to
substrate, ORR, and so on. Whether the description of
stability should be subdivided into several parameters or
unified as a specific parameter needs to be considered.
Furthermore, many parameters of OECTs are directly
related to the device size, including gm and τ, which
makes them hard to compare among different materials.
We imagine that it would be much beneficial if we cou-
ld compare
certain
parameters
with
unified
device
configuration.
As a growing field, there are still many challenges
that have not been addressed in OECTs. N-type materials
are still in shortage and their performances lag far behind
that of the p-type ones, which impedes the development
of OECT-based amplifiers and logic circuits. Besides, slow
response time (τ) is one of the major drawbacks for
OECTs (Figure 8A). The development of real-time sens-
ing and high-speed devices requires further reduction of
τ, while, as we know, no effective material design method
has been developed for reducing the response time yet.
Moreover, the fabrication of OECTs is still on a small
scale. Even so, we have observed a large variation among
different devices. Thus, how to achieve satisfactory per-
formance with good uniformity at large-scare is also an
important issue.77 Last but not least, the Vth is an often
ignored parameter compared to μC*. Theoretically, the
jVgj should be less than 0.6 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) to avoid
harmful side reactions in aqueous solutions,19 and low
Vth can lower the operating voltage of devices to realize
low-power consumption and long operation life. As
shown in Figure 8B, many high-μC* materials have
shown large jVthj, especially for D–A polymers. There-
fore, reducing the threshold voltage to gain maximum
transconductance at nearly zero gate bias is desirable for
many biosensing applications.
