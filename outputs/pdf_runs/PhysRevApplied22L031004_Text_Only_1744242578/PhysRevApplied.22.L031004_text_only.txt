We present a ﬁrst-principles numerical study of charge transport in a realistic two-dimensional tight-
binding model of organic molecular semiconductors. We use the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm to
simulate the full quantum dynamics of phonons and either single or multiple charge carriers without any
tunable parameters. We introduce a number of algorithmic improvements, including eﬃcient Metropolis
updates for phonon ﬁelds based on analytical insights, which lead to negligible autocorrelation times
and allow sub-per-mille precisions to be reached at a low computational cost of O (1) CPU hours. Our
simulations produce charge-mobility estimates that are in good agreement with experiments and that also
justify the phenomenological transient localization approach.

Introduction. Organic molecular semiconductors are tech-
nologically interesting materials with distinctive charge-
transport physics [1]. The conduction and valence bands
are narrow and can be described as being formed by
the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbitals of the constituent molecules. The transfer integrals
between these localized orbitals undergo large thermal
ﬂuctuations, similar in magnitude to the transfer integrals
themselves. With characteristic optical phonon frequen-
cies being considerably smaller than both the temperature
and the bandwidth, the resulting dynamic disorder has
been extensively studied using semiclassical approaches
to nuclear degrees of freedom, such as Ehrenfest dynam-
ics [2] or surface hopping [3–6]. These studies led to
the conjecture of an unconventional transient localization
(TL) charge-transport mechanism [7,8], driven by transi-
tions between electron states that are transiently localized
(in the Anderson sense) at timescales shorter than inverse
characteristic phonon frequencies [9–15].
However, it is well known that semiclassical approxi-
mations for nuclear degrees of freedom (or, equivalently,
phonons) may lead to incorrect conclusions about charge
transport in the case of strong electron-phonon interac-
tions [16,17]. To ensure that the popular TL scenario is not
an artefact of semiclassical approximations, it is therefore

extremely important to verify it in ﬁrst-principles simula-
tions without any assumptions about the classical behavior
of phonons or nuclei.
So far, ﬁrst-principles numerical studies of charge trans-
port in molecular semiconductors were carried out only
for one-dimensional models, mostly at low charge density
[18–21] (see Ref. [22] for an overview of relevant numer-
ical methods). However, the dimensionality of the model
has dramatic eﬀects on the physics involving disorder-
driven localization in the electronic Hamiltonian. The
vast majority of molecular semiconductors have a layered
structure, such that transport takes place predominantly in
a two-dimensional (2D) plane. It is also observed that a
fairly general model that captures almost the entire class of
crystalline materials is formed by molecules on a triangular
lattice interacting with their three nonequivalent neigh-
bors through a transfer integral that is (heavily) modulated
by phonons, see Fig. 1. This class of materials is well
described by the TL model in the relaxation-time approxi-
mation (RTA) [23], also in the presence of high-frequency
phonons that eﬀectively renormalize the bandwidth [12].
However, the corresponding relaxation time, τin, is a phe-
nomenological parameter that is not directly connected
to the model Hamiltonian and cannot be assumed to be
universal.
Here, we propose hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simu-
lations of the two-dimensional tight-binding model on a
triangular lattice as a ﬁrst-principles reference method-
ology to describe charge transport in molecular semi-
conductors. We calculate the charge-carrier mobility and
its temperature dependence entirely from ﬁrst principles
for a broad range of model parameters, without possible
artefacts from considering the nuclei classically [2–5],

The argument for the determinant in Eq. (3) is a real-

that the path integral weight is real and non-negative for
Ns = 2 spin components and any chemical potential μe.
Correspondingly, it can be used as a statistical weight for
Monte Carlo algorithms, which generate conﬁgurations of

Monte carlo algorithm. To sample phonon ﬁelds xk,a (τ)
with a probability distribution that corresponds to the path
integral weight in Eq. (3), we use the HMC algorithm
[31–33] with an exact Fourier acceleration (EFA) [34]
inspired by Refs. [35–37] that relies on the analytical inte-
gration of the bosonic molecular dynamics. The HMC
algorithm is universally applicable throughout the entire
parameter space of the model, Eq. (1), and for any value
of charge density. It provides reliable ﬁrst-principles esti-
mates of the mobility, μ, in a run time that scales as

, where V is the number of lat-
tice sites and Nτ is the number of discrete steps in τ used
to calculate the time-ordered exponent in Eq. (3) [26]. An
implementation is publicly available [38].
We ﬁnd that our HMC algorithm with EFA is extremely
eﬃcient over the entire range of experimentally relevant
Hamiltonian parameters and temperatures T = 100–400 K
and does not suﬀer from long autocorrelation times
[25,26,39], in contrast to previous HMC studies of
electron-phonon models [39–42] that focus on sponta-
neously ordered electron states.
Low-density or single-charge-carrier limit. Typical charge
densities in molecular semiconductors are very low, n ≲
0.01. As we explicitly demonstrate in Fig. 2, interelec-
tron interactions become negligible at such low densities,
and it is suﬃcient to consider the dynamics of a single
charge carrier interacting with a bath of thermal phonons
[7,18–20,22]. Therefore, we also consider this regime
explicitly, in addition to the full ﬁnite-density simulations,
which allows us to accelerate our HMC algorithm even
further.
Expanding the many-body partition function, Eq. (3), in
powers of the fugacity, eβμe, the partition function in the
Hilbert subspace with charge Q = 1 is found to be [26]

The path integral weight in Eq. (6) is always positive
for our range of model parameters, which allows us to
use the HMC algorithm with EFA again. This provides
a practical alternative to worldline (WLMC) [19] and
diagrammatic Monte Carlo [18] simulations for polaron-
type single-particle systems, which becomes particularly
advantageous for charge transport in molecular semicon-
ductors. The equivalence between HMC and the ensemble

the HMC yields the current-current correlator, Eq. (4),
in the single-particle Hilbert subspace on lattices with
O (1000) sites with per-mille-level precision, which is cru-
cial for a numerically stable inversion of the Green-Kubo
relationship, Eq. (5).
Numerical results. To illustrate the main features of our
numerical method and to compare it with the TL approach,
we consider a large class of molecular semiconductors
(including rubrene, see Fig. 1), which can be mapped onto
the tight-binding Hamiltonian, Eq. (1), with J2 = J3 ̸= J1
with suﬃciently good precision [23]. We use a convenient
parametrization [23]:
J1 = J cos θ,
J2 = J sin θ/

J3 = J sin θ/

Thermal ﬂuctuations of transfer integrals are usually
around Ja ≈Ja/2 at room temperature, T0 = 25 meV.
From this, we estimate the electron-phonon couplings, λa
in Eq. (1), and assume that λa are temperature indepen-
dent, so that the temperature dependence of Ja is entirely
driven by thermal phonon ﬂuctuations, ⟨ˆx2
k,a⟩. When we
consider the parametrization of Eq. (7) for a generic molec-
ular semiconductor, we assume a typical triangular lattice
with bond lengths |⃗da| = 7.2 Å (see Fig. 1) and phonon
frequencies ω0 = 6 meV [1,23,26].
First, we check the range of applicability of the low-
density (single-particle) approximation by performing full
HMC simulations at ﬁnite charge densities and checking
how quickly the low-density limit, μ0 = μ (n →0), of

Fig. 2 for a symmetric generic molecular semiconductor
with J1 = J2 = J3 = 100 meV/
√
3. We use lattices with
15 × 15 and 18 × 18 lattice sites, with Nτ = 48 and Nτ =
64 steps for Euclidean time τ in Eq. (3), thereby explicitly
checking that we reach the thermodynamic and continuum-
time limits [26]. The results from 18 × 18 lattices with
Nτ = 64 shown in Fig. 2 suggest that ﬁnite-density eﬀects
become smaller than 1% at n ≲0.01 holes per lattice
cell, which is in good correspondence with typical charge
densities in transistor devices based on molecular semicon-
ductors. In what follows, we therefore present the mobility
values obtained directly at the single-particle (low-density)
limit from Eq. (6).
In Fig. 3, we present the temperature dependence of
the low-density charge mobility in a generic molecular
semiconductor with parametrization, Eq. (7), ﬁtting data
to the power law, μ ∼T−α, α > 0, expected for bandlike
transport. The ﬁts describe the data very well, support-
ing the experimental evidence [4] for an intermediate
regime between bandlike transport and thermally activated
hopping in molecular semiconductors in the experimen-
tally relevant range of parameters and temperatures. More
speciﬁcally, close to the symmetric case, θ/π ≈0.3, we
ﬁnd α = 1 with very high precision.
As a benchmark of the TL model, in Fig. 4, we compare
HMC results for the dependence of charge mobility on the
relative magnitude of transfer integrals, as parametrized
by θ in Eq. (7), with the predictions of TL RTA cal-
culations [23] (with relaxation time τin = 1/ω0, which is
typical for this method, but might not be the optimal value
[43]). Both methods produce a qualitatively similar depen-
dence on θ, but the HMC yields a considerably stronger
dependence on the overall hopping strength, J, towards

of any approximations, given the initial Hamiltonian, any
deviations from experiment are either due to experimen-
tal uncertainties or limitations of our model Hamiltonian,
Eq. (1) (such as a simpliﬁed phonon spectrum with just a
single frequency).
Conclusions and outlook. We advocate HMC simulations
as an eﬃcient tool for ﬁrst-principles studies of charge
transport in molecular semiconductors. Its computational
eﬃciency makes the HMC well-suited for the discov-
ery of high-mobility semiconductors by means of large-
scale scans through the space of Hamiltonian parameters
[13,23]. Our results also provide a rigorous justiﬁcation
of the TL model without invoking any phenomenological
parameters, such as relaxation time.
Our numerical approach is ready to be extended towards
more realistic simulations. Since the computational com-
plexity of the method is dominated by manipulations with
fermionic matrices, additional phonon modes, nontrivial
phonon dispersions, and nonlinear terms in the electron-
phonon and phonon-phonon interactions can all be intro-
duced practically at no extra cost. Extrinsic disorder, which
is important for the realistic description of charge localiza-
tion at low temperatures, T ≲150 K [19,20], can be easily
introduced as a random site-dependent chemical poten-
tial in the Hamiltonian, Eq. (1). Likewise, charge-carrier
interactions in doped organic semiconductors [49] can be
treated by the HMC algorithm without any approxima-
tions. The method can also easily accommodate the eﬀects
of an external magnetic ﬁeld, such as the Hall current and
spin polarization. Optical response in the THz range is also
straightforward to explore.
